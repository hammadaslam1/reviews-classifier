I ended up getting the F80Q-X2AM because it's bigger than a netbook but it's not really big. The 14.1 inch screen and full sized keyboard are just what I was looking for. This laptop has everything you could want: DVD player, webcam, big hard drive, lots of RAM, memory card reader, wireless network card, bluetooth, decent carrying case.  Good stuff. On top of that, the 2-year warranty, accidental damage protection, and spill-proof keyboard are really nice, especially for a laptop going to a young kid.\n\nThe only thing I don't like about this laptop is the operating system. Windows Vista is for the birds, and I'm not just saying that. I've had bad experiences with Vista in the past, so I'm biased negatively with respect to Vista. On the other hand, I used to work at Microsoft and I like the company a lot. But when it takes 3 hours to get connected to a wireless network, you know you're using a crummy operating sytem. Specifically, I encountered the infamous \"unidentified network\"\" problem which millions of others have likely experienced over the last couple of years with Vista. Although there's seemingly no sure fire way to fix the problem",

Six months later, it's still running well with no problems and I'm continually glad I made the purchase.\n\nI also do some casual gaming with it, thanks to the Nvidia graphics card. Games like Dragon Age push it to it's limits, but it can still handle newer games. It has no trouble with anything older than that (unless there are compatibility issues between the game and Windows 7.\n\nI plan on using this laptop as I return to graduate school and feel like it's size, weight, and speed will work well for me to use it mainly for work, and a bit of entertainment on the side.\n\nMy chief complaints, which keep me from giving it 5 stars, are that it doesn't have separate media buttons for changing the volume (though this can be done by holding the function key and hitting F11 or F12), it's lack of various video output ports, and that the speakers distort when turned up all the way.

After several years of so-so performance I installed Linux Mint 17 (now 18) on the machine and boy what a difference that made. The netbook went from being a machine that I kept in the bag most of the time to becoming my daily driver. The sluggish, laggy performance with Windows 7 was replaced with snappy, responsive performance that, in conjunction with the small form factor, made the netbook an ideal on-the-go device. I can safely say 9 years after my original purchase that the machine is significantly faster today running Linux Mint than it was when brand new running Windows 7 Starter. My wife and I own a multi-million dollar IT services company, and this netbook has been serving as my primary business \"laptop\"\" for the past 5 years.

The mousepad buttons are sometimes hard to use, though once you get used to it they aren't so bad. When certain programs pop up, like quick info on a product from a website or iTunes, sometimes the screen can't fit it all and there is no way to scroll through.

The jack for the power cord seems very fragile.  The touchpad, and its single bar, rather than a right and left click button, is a nuisance. In Linux at least, I can't use two finger scrolling.  The touchpad is bumpy and there's a smooth area to the right that will work for one finger scrolling.

It has a lot of fancy features like three-finger swipe, rotate, etc., but these were kicking in accidentally a lot, so I turned them all off. The screen has a little piece of crud in between the plastic outer cover and the actual display--not a big deal, but like an itch you can't scratch. The external off/on switch for the wi-fi & bluetooth is very handy to have, but it's right next to a USB port and it's easy to hit the switch when changing out devices and turn wi-fi off by mistake (at least with my hands). All these shortcomings have been small compared to the overall experience. Like the review title says, this laptop is almost perfect.",

One of the reasons I got it was to replace my older desktop, which the Asus does a great job at for a notebook.  It is larger than many other models an offers plenty of screen and key board space, it is quite at home on my desk.  But I also wanted the versatility of being able to travel with it, and if you don't mind lugging around close to ten pounds it does that as well.  The problem with going mobile is the battery life, you only get about 1.5 hours before the battery warning comes on.  I compromised this feature for all the other great features it does have: crisp, clear and large screen; blistering fast speed, great sound; solid build.  All in all it is a great notebook but not sure if it is worth the money at over $1000.00 with so many others available at far less, but again I haven't experienced them either so maybe not.  I am happy with mine and would recommend it to anyone that can afford it and is not looking for the best value neccessarily, just looking for the best.",

For the price alone, with a core i7 processor added with their warranty (which I hope I won't claim), no doubt that this is one of the most affordable units out there. It's not as stylish compared to others but looks are subjective, this unit appears to me, both elegant and contemporary. Besides, I didn'y buy this for it's looks but for it's power. Just read the specs and drool. It has a nice well-spaced chiclet keyboard(not lighted) which is comparative to a Vaio, lots of ports and connectors and the latest USB 3.0. Drawbacks that I encountered though which you will read also from other reviews are the low screen resolution which I really don't mind, besides that's what having an LED/LCD HDTV for; the vent on the side tends to get hot. I bought a fan for it though amazingly, the bottom part is cool; sensitive touch pad but I use an optical mouse so not really a concern. I suggest you buy an extra long lasting battery as this computer drains your battery fast especially when you are mobile.\n\nUpdate : 12/14/2016\nStill running ok after 6 1/2 years...except for the bloatware, i love this laptop.",

The Video Magic software from ASUS allows for enhancement for videos, and I've been impressed with the output.  The only disappointment would be if you do a lot of work in PS CS4...the resolution isn't the best for fine-tuning high-res photos.  Not really a big deal.\n\nThe only other downside is that my webcam is upside down.  Jeers to ASUS for not yet addressing this problem with this model on their website.

And as far as being able to reinstall Windows 7 Basic, there is a 10GB hidden partition (which is mostly full) on the hard drive that holds all the necessary files to return the netbook back to its original state.  I have not personally tried this, but have read multiple sources online stating that is what this partition is for.  I have only used this for 3 days now, but so far very satisfied.\n\nOne last note, the matte cover is nice, but the screen frame and area below the keyboard is still a finger print magnet.",

Unfortunately, once it was charged up and ready to go, we found that the internet barely connected anywhere in our house.  Even standing right in front of the wireless router, I only got 3 out of 5 bars of connectivity.  I restarted both the netbook and the router, checked for bios updates and uninstalled and reinstalled the driver software.  All the while, our laptop computer connected to the internet with full coverage and no problems.\nNothing worked for the netbook, so I called up the Asus help line to see what they could recommend.  Both me and the guy I spoke with on the other line had a hard time understanding each other because of a language barrier and I think this may have contributed to the frustration.  He told me there was nothing wrong with my netbook and that I needed to be standing within 5-10 feet of the router for the connection to work.  I explained that this was absurd and that I wanted to send it back for one that worked.  Needless to say, the conversation ended badly.  Luckily, Amazon allowed me to return it anyway.  As always, they have the best return policy.  As I told the fellow on the phone, I won't purchase anything from Asus any longer, but I will definitely get my next netbook from Amazon.",

The ensuing struggle with ASUS's phone support to get an RMA was so monumentally horrible that it poisoned me against the ASUS brand permanently. (I had to postpone a trip to the States, so, sadly, I fell out of Amazon's 30-day warranty window.) Here's the message I left ASUS on my customer satisfaction survey:\n\nDealing with ASUS phone support was so unpleasant that, while I think ASUS products are generally of very high quality and have built two pcs with ASUS motherboards and other components, I will never purchase another ASUS product. I bought an ASUS Eee PC 1005PR-PU17-BK that did not have a functioning Broadcom HD chipset. This problem was widespread and well documented by other purchasers on the Amazon and Newegg websites. Amazon even pulled the netbook off its site for a time because of the problem. Regardless, ASUS's phone support reps seemed to have zero knowledge of this, and they did everything they could, including twisting truth into a pretzel, to avoid giving me an RMA. Good going, ASUS.

And the RAM expansion slot in the one I got didn't work and Acer tech support was entirely unhelpful. I returned it.\n\nBy happy contrast, the Vivobook feels quite sturdy, almost like aluminum even where it's plastic, and the inside seems... not premium, but well built. And RAM installation (and SSD replacement) went smoothly. Great BIOS, too, the best I've seen.\n\nMine *did* come with a 2.5 inch hard drive expansion caddy and connector in the box, which is a nice touch.\nI'm running Linux (openSUSE Tumbleweed) on it and it runs flawlessly. Just boot to BIOS and turn off Secure Boot and Fast Startup, then reboot to a USB flash drive with the installer for the distro of your choice.\n\nI do think the Aspire has a somewhat better screen.

I can run Photoshop, Spotify and a bunch of browsers without it slowing down.\n\nBattery life is phenomenal.\n\nThe screen is great. The touch screen works amazingly too.\n\nI got the Burgundy and it's even cuter in person. It's sort of punk pinkish. I love it. The material on the inside is nice, I'm not sure how it will wear eventually but in the meantime it's been great and comfortable.\n\nYou won't regret your purchase!\n\nEDIT: almost 2 years later and this computer still works like a charm!!! the fabric inside isn\u2019t worn down and i work from home on it, literally 8 hours a day m-f for the last 2 years! it\u2019s not as new looking, but still in pretty great shape! still runs super fast, amazing. battery life isn\u2019t as strong but not a deal breaker",

I started to use it again and if I stopped for any reason it would go black and I would have to hit the power button to get the screen again. I tired to work with it and just gave up. This morning (Tuesday) I went on line to chat with the Samsung Support. I installed the program that allowed the tech to access my tablet.\nHe checked it out and recommend I set it back to factory re stall. I did and then I could not even work to set it up again as it kept going black.\nThe Samsung tech said it was most likely a factory defect and I could take it to a Samsung repair shop to have it fixed for free. That is not acceptable for me to have to repair a brand new tablet. So I am sending it back. I am not sure if I will purchase another Samsung Tablet A\nor go with another brand. I will have to think about it for a while. I liked the size and look of the tablet, it just would not stay on long enough for me to use it.",

I do like the tablet and can do pretty much what our apples do.  The main thing I may be unhappy with is not being able to move some of the apps to the SD card.  I don't go app crazy so I only have a few apps but I'm disappointed that some won't move to the external SD card and it seems like the 16 GB memory is filling up fast.  Haven't checked user guide to see if there are more options to free up space once the internal storage is full but could be I can uninstall a lot of pre-loaded apps that I won't use. Galaxy has a great reputation and I do like the chance to learn about android since my wife has an android tablet.  Because it's not like iOS it takes a while to accomplish what we want but so far have muddled my way through things.  I have also heard because android is a user based OS that it is easier to hack. Also read that sometimes moving apps or some things from 1 android OS to another may not work.  The tablet seems to run slower than apples and at times it seems like it locks up.  I'm  sure if you're an android fan the tablet would rate 5 stars.  I gave it 4 because the cost of the android is more reasonable than apple.  Hope this is helpful.",

The phablet I found was too big and awkward to comfortably fit in my pockets, but small enough that reading books or watching tv was a bit uncomfortable on the eyes.  By contrast the 10\" nexus and surface pro 4 (which I use for work primarily) are to large to fit in my mid size purses.  This size can fit in nearly every one of my bags ( the only exception being my small clutches and evening bags).\n\n It works quickly, and I havent had any issues with it overheating. It is a bit of a slow charger, and if your are using the tablet with the screen on full brightness, it will drain the battery faster then it will charge. I did find however, that so long as you have the brightness set to the lowest level, it will (slowly) charge at a rate of about 1% increase per 10 minutes.  In normal conditions, if I am not charging and using simultaneously, it takes a couple hours to fully charge.\n\nThe blue smoke color is beautiful.

The S2 needs the Quad Core processors and the higher performance GPU to push everything out on to that beautiful screen. The processor on the Tab A has a lot less work to do and it does it remarkably well...especially for a $169 tablet. Can I tell the difference when I put this tablet and my S2 side by side?

The ability to charge via a USB-C cable, from either side of the computer, is handy. I do also wish it had an HDMI port for easier connections to projectors and such. Pretty sure the USB-C port can output the signal if I had the right adapter, but I don't (yet?). Plenty of apps are available from the Play store. Though not certain ones I had hoped for, like my kindle app (Amazon and Google don't get along in Chromebook-land, I guess; I found a workaround in the Kindle cloud reader).

It's not going to be the most amazing chromebook out there, but it's under 300 dollars people!  One of the major pros to this chromebook is it's 15.6 inch screen. This is alot larger than most chromebooks that average about 11 to 14 inches.  It also offers 1080p which sounds great but stretched out across the 15.6 inch screen it does make some graphics and fonts a little bit  blurry. The product page on Amazon says Acer say the battery life lasts up ton10 hours, I'd say that definitely depends on what you're doing. Watching my daughter play on it, I'd say that it lasts at about 7 hours but that's mostly playing games. Another cool feature is the two upward facing speakers that flank both sides of the keyboard, and the touchpad is a rather larger size. This particular chromebook is not a touchscreen screen, but you are able to use the play store which isn pretty awesome being able to use some many apps. It has USB c ports and a headphone Jack port as well. It does come with a web cam, and the outside of the computer is a nice silver.

Windows said it wasn't activated and it wasn't obvious how to do that, so a quick email to support resulted in a fast reply giving me the command to find the Windows product key which worked with activation.\n\nThe keys to a gaming machine are making sure it doesn't overheat but that cooling it doesn't generate a ton of fan noise. The Mek has eight fans in it - three at the front, one at the back, as well as two on the graphics card and two on the CPU liquid cooler. I've monitored temperatures during gameplay and GPU and all CPU cores run cool, maxing out at no more than 70C. The fans are relatively quiet and not noticeable above the usual volume of gameplay. So excellent cooling with low noise.\n\nFor expansion there are two open DIMM slots and two open PCIE slots, although one of them would put a PCIE card very close to the graphics card fan so it may not be the best choice.\n\nThe only minor con I've noticed is although there are a ton of USB ports, there is no USB C. This is a nit because USB A to C cables are readily available. Also it would be possible to add a cheap PCIE USB C card if necessary.\n\nIn summary I'm delighted with the Mek, and my one minor interaction with their support team was positive.",

Also the charger cable seemed a little loose, so I just assumed it was the charger going prematurely bad.

For example it's not the lightest notebook in it's class, but it's certainly not heavy at all.  It's slim and you could easily take it places without much trouble.  The main tradeoff at this price is that you're buying a standard HD, not solid state which means the HD spins and consumes more power, thus battery life won't be as good if you're a chronic road warrior, but it will last at a coffee shop or during a flight on full charge, especially if you manage the power settings appropriately.

The pointer changing to a sort of crosshair look.  This problem started to happen more and more frequently and now the laptop cannot be used for more than 2-3 minutes without it happening.  Tried various forms of troubleshooting and after finally taking it in the problem is apparently the motherboard.  MSI offered to fix it... for more than the cost of the entire laptop.  This has been extremely disappointing as the issue is from the parts used to build this machine and MSI wont take any responsibility for it because the warranty just expired.\n\nOverall this experience has decidedly made us unlikely to ever purchase an MSI product again.",

They rapidly rectified the issue in days with just a couple emails.\n\nThe computer itself was clean, the display is delightfully clear and bright.

AMD has an excellent line of CPUs and are comparable to Intel's latest generation. The construction of the ProBook follows the same frame design as the EliteBook which is the top of the line business machine, with fewer ports.

The base station installs under a cabinet via 4 bolts. This base unit has a built-in counter-top light with three brightness levels as an added plus. The RCA tablet fits into a tablet-holder built into the under-cabinet base station and the RCA tablet gets its power from the under-cabinet base station.  Also, the under-cabinet base station has buttons which control the tablet i.e. volume/on-off. The tablet can be removed from the base station and used independently. Any mini-USB charger will fit the RCA tablet for charging when not attached to the base station. Having this CA tablet & base station is also like having an under-cabinet TV or media player, plus access to videos and email. When not in use, the RCA tablet can be swing up into hiding. My only problems were with the android apps that only run in screen portrait mode. When the tablet is attached to the under-cabinet base station, any apps that force portrait mode will be displayed sideways on the tablet screen. Not good. And the RCA tablet comes with Android version 10 and version 10 will lose support come September 2022. So any apps updated beyond version 10 may not run in this table after Sept 2022. This is probably why the tablet and under-counter base staten combo has dropped 50% in price lately. But until apps stop working with this tablet, this is a good under-cabinet combo.",

And version 9 doesn't even support updates or security patches. Google play store doesn't support some apps using version 9, if it was at the 10 version it would support more apps. This is an issue with me personally because 3 apps that are very important to have isn't supported anymore on version 9. But I guess that's what you get for this product to be only 99 bucks.

I fully believed that the previous experience with Dell was a fluke and had no fear in buying another. Unfortunately, it was not a fluke. A couple of weeks into the new purchase, the screen went very dim and started to flicker. I called Dell and was told that I needed to send the computer in for a new screen. The computer was three weeks old!!! So, now, I\u2019m reliving the same experience. I have owned many Dell computers in the past. Nonetheless, I would be very wary of buying the Inspiron 7000 series.

I have a larger computer, but it was getting heavy lugging it around campus.\nPros:\nIt is super lightweight and has a small footprint.  Since it is smaller, it fits easily in my backpack and even in some of my purses and in my tote purse.  I also just traveled and it was great for on the plane.  The battery lasts all day, which is perfect if you are running around a lot and not always near an outlet.  Since it is so small, it does not take up much space on my desks, tables in the library, and is great when you have class in a lecture hall with the super small fold up \"desks\".  It is also easy to hold in my lap.\n\nCons:\nThere are very few.  Sometimes, it can get bogged down because it doesn't have a lot of RAM.  There is not much on board memory, but I use Google Drive for my files, so that is not a big deal.  I also just keep a micro SD inserted for if I need to save anything on there. What really annoyed me at first was since it has such a less popular charging cord, it took me a while to find one that I was confident would work.\n\nOverall, I love this computer.  I use it in all the various modes because it can be easier when I am on the plane, in the car, or in class.

I ended up getting the F80Q-X2AM because it's bigger than a netbook but it's not really big. The 14.1 inch screen and full sized keyboard are just what I was looking for. This laptop has everything you could want: DVD player, webcam, big hard drive, lots of RAM, memory card reader, wireless network card, bluetooth, decent carrying case. Good stuff.

The only thing I don't like about this laptop is the operating system. Windows Vista is for the birds, and I'm not just saying that. I've had bad experiences with Vista in the past, so I'm biased negatively with respect to Vista. On the other hand, I used to work at Microsoft and I like the company a lot. But when it takes 3 hours to get connected to a wireless network, you know you're using a crummy operating sytem. Specifically, I encountered the infamous unidentified network problem which millions of others have likely experienced over the last couple of years with Vista.

If you're looking for a dependable and quality laptop for usage mainly within the home, it will probably be a good fit.

        "input: I have been using this notebook regularly for the past 9 years. I originally purchased the device for its size and portability, but found that it didn't really have the horsepower to keep up with Windows 7 (Starter Edition). After several months, I chose to upgrade the system RAM from 1GB to 2GB, which definitely helped, but it was still pretty laggy, especially when surfing the web. After several years of so-so performance I installed Linux Mint 17 (now 18) on the machine and boy what a difference that made. The netbook went from being a machine that I kept in the bag most of the time to becoming my daily driver. The sluggish, laggy performance with Windows 7 was replaced with snappy, responsive performance that, in conjunction with the small form factor, made the netbook an ideal on-the-go device. I can safely say 9 years after my original purchase that the machine is significantly faster today running Linux Mint than it was when brand new running Windows 7 Starter. My wife and I own a multi-million dollar IT services company, and this netbook has been serving as my primary business  laptop   for the past 5 years. At this juncture I wouldn't trade my old netbook for a brand new device... its become like an old trusted friend.",

        "input: Asus nearly has the netbook PC perfected. The size and ergonomics of this keyboard are bar none the best among netbooks today. The wide touchpad has the right level of sensitivity as well. And Windows 7, even with the entry level Starter edition, offers much faster processing & bootup times than Windows XP does on the Intel Atom N270 processor. However, the Asus Eee 1005HA has its achilles heel in mechanical design. The 250GB HDD has undamped vibrations that pass throughout the chassis and straight into your wrists. The fan also runs excessively. The combination creates high levels of noise and vibration compared to similar netbooks such as the Acer Aspire One D250. Also, even without Anti-Virus software running, Windows 7 and the preloaded software consume 40% of the available 1GB of memory. Asus will undoubtedly be working out the kinks in this netbook, but many users will find the vibration and noise levels to be unacceptable, especially when other manufacturers offer netbooks without these concerns. Once Asus releases a thermally cool, vibrationless version with 2GB DDR2 memory, this netbook will be unstoppable. Update: after exchanging for a second 1005HA, it has the exact same vibration issues. This endemic rather than a one-off dud.",

I bought this to replace my extra heavy Laptop which i got fed-up of carrying around. This Netbook is small, light and extremely portable. I use it all day at school and the battery life is really good (way better than my laptop that gives me 15 minutes of battery power) Its Wi-Fi connectivity is excellent. The screen size is good and the keyboard is nice and sturdy. Setup is a breeze even a kid can do it It comes with crappy Windows 7 Starter but I upgraded it to Windows 7 Home Premium the same day i got it. I have customized the setting to my taste and it works really good. It is a great addition to your PC arsenal if you need something nice and portable.

The netbook is beautiful, light weight and very handy but from the first moment till now I have a terrible noise on de left speaker... sounds like a radio without station. I can't change on Amazon because I bought in US and the Brazilian ASUS support doesn't want to help me. :( About the computer, it was a gift to my wife and she loved it. The battery goes long but 5 hours maximum... 8.5 as advertized, no way! Five hours is enough for us, so, we are happy with it! The keyboard is OK for her (small hands) but not so OK for my (very big hands)... the screen is to small to work all day long, so I do recommend to use as a second notebook (like us)... The performance is OK for office and internet... but, like Michael would say, this is it! Windows 7 started seems good for the atom270 processor but is too much for it to do more than one task at the same time, like copy lots of file and streaming a video (youtube)... so for a second notebook, not bad! Windows 7 starter is a little poor and it doesn't have some configurations. I think if your objective is to access internet in a mall or during a traffic jam, this is the right product.",

I bought it mostly for surfing the web and typing, I'm a writer so the convenience of a netbook was something I really wanted. Overall I've loved the computer. It is small and lightweight, with a sleeve I can carry it in my purse or bookbag. The battery life is a lot better than my old laptop and the power chord is nice and long, so not a hassle to have plugged in when I'm at home. The mousepad works really well, better than some of the other ones I've seen on netbooks. I read in one of the other reviews about the vibrating and noise this computer makes, and I haven't had an issue with that at all. There are a couple things I've noticed to be a hassle on the computer though. The mousepad buttons are sometimes hard to use, though once you get used to it they aren't so bad. When certain programs pop up, like quick info on a product from a website or iTunes, sometimes the screen can't fit it all and there is no way to scroll through. I guess a lot of programs are just made for computers with a larger screen. Windows 7 starter has a lot of limitations, but that's to be expected.

Sound and wireless worked with Fedora, Ubuntu and ArchLinux. I also have an Asus 1000HE. This is a bit smaller and lighter. I give it a 4, rather than a 5, for a few reasons, most of which have been stated in other reviews. It's a fingerprint magnet. The jack for the power cord seems very fragile. The touchpad, and its single bar, rather than a right and left click button, is a nuisance. In Linux at least, I can't use two finger scrolling. The touchpad is bumpy and there's a smooth area to the right that will work for one finger scrolling. Note that this is in Linux, I don't know how it works in Windows. Other than that, it's a netbook. It's small, not that powerful, but fine for browsing, reading ebooks, skype (though probably better with headphones), documents and the like. It's pretty similar to the 1000HE, with the upside of less size and weight, plus a better keyboard (full size right hand shift key this time), but with a flimsier connector from power cord to computer and that touch pad. I remember years ago, the Gateway Arc 200 (an ultralight--but not a netbook, it was rather expensive at the time) had the middle mouse button as a little wheel on a bar above the touchpad. I've never seen it since, but for me, at least, it was the most convenient trackpad equivalent of a mouse button that I've used.",

        "input: This laptop is slick. I purchased this to replace a failing four year old Macbook. With a battery life of around eleven hours in a low power mode, the laptop is ultra-portable. Kicking into a higher performance mode takes a few seconds and leaves you with a little under half of the maximum battery life. The touchpad is a bit unconventional and I'm still getting used to it. It is completely level with the surface of the laptop and I have found my fingers like to wander off the edges of the usable area. The instant-on splashtop was a nice surprise. I wasn't even aware of the functionality when I purchased the computer. The applications are very basic and the music player rates pretty low on the intuitive features list but it does play music after you have your playlists set up. Though it is fairly big, it's just as thin and lightweight. I don't plan to do any serious gaming on the computer, but I do play EVE. It ran quite well with the G210M on. I have only had this product for about a day but so far I'm very happy with it.",

        "input: I give only 3 stars to this laptop because it uses a cheap processor. The Intel T6600 processor costs less, which is why laptops with this type of CPU cost less, but that is at the expense of some pretty important features. The biggest problem is that this laptop's CPU does not support Hardware Assisted Virtualization (VT). This means you cant use the XP mode offered by Windows 7 Ultimate. You cant run VM's on the majority of Virtualization products (VMWARE, VirtualPC). There is a workaround for XP mode by using VMLite, but this is the single biggest weak point of this laptop. Otherwise I find it ok. Returning this laptop for lack of VT means Amazon will charge their usual 15% restocking fee and its not worth that. My advise is that if you are a serious user who likes advanced features, look around for a laptop with a better processor. If you are looking for a cheap system with reasonable specs then choose this. You will never be able to enjoy Win 7 Ultimate (with all its features) on this laptop. Caveat Emptor.",

Couldn't find anything 13.3in with CD/DVD player at reasonable price but at 14in the Asus comes pretty close. Has bluetooth, HDMI, Wireless a/b/g/n and 2.2GHZ cpu, lighted keyboard and multitouch touchpad, all good to have besides the usual base feature set. Appears too glossy for me and certainly a fingerprint magnet. The mousepad could have been better designed. It's a little bit too small and the clicker feels awkward, but I guess I might get used to it soon. The screen looks very good but the default setup was a little too bright so I adjusted it down a little. Runs pretty cool and reasonably quiet. Compared side by side with a Sony VGN-SR390 13.3in and I liked the looks of the Sony better. But the U80V is about 500.00 cheaper and the Sony's keyboard is not lighted. I choose the ASUS for features and value but honestly my heart was with the Sony. :-) Even though advertised as thin, the ASUS is not that thin at about 1.3 in, but comfortable to sit on my laptop and type while watching TV.

I did not wanted to make the same mistake that I made the last time by buying an underpowered pc. This ASUS N61JQ-A1 has a lot of power and it is a beautiful system. Something that I was concern about when I bough it on-line was the color. On line is described as being a dark brown. It is dark brown but it is so dark that it looks black and in addition the pattern in the design is awesome. I bough mine at Costco on-line because they offer the best return policy that I know of and they had the best price I could find. I was tented to buy the ASUS G51 which has almost the same components and in addition better resolution for a bit more money but I am glad I pick the N61JQ-A1 because of the elegant look. The G51's design is just not cut out for the work environment because of its extravagant looks. The good thing is that the screen resolution has not been an issue for me when I play some games.

I used to hate typing numbers on laptops - no more! HUGE screen - yet fairly light Not very hot- no more burned wrists (although it is quite hot back towards the screen... so watch your laps!!!) and... last... but not least!!!! IT IS CHEAP (for what it is)... I tried to buy it here, but thought about it too long, and missed the half a C-note under a G, but was still in time for the end of cashback from MS - I sure will miss that program. Cons: ASUS bloatware - easily remedied awkward placement of power plug - I like laying the laptop down on it's side - and this doesn't allow me to. as others have noted - it will be covered with fingerprints... again- who cares. Wireless N is single band (only 2.4, no 5ghz) All in all - I could not be more pleased...

This laptop has been my faithful companion for well over 4 years, throughout the end of middle school and much of my High School life. This laptop is special to me, as it has been the first one I'd ever gotten that actually ran the games I wanted to play effectively (my two previous laptops were Dell notebooks and they sucked real bad at gaming). The good things about this laptop: 1) Decent for running games made from at latest 2012 to older (portal 2, skyrim, and anything older run great). Runs smoothly and is capable of handling stressful loads (or at least I remember it being that way). I had a lot of fun times playing games using this laptop for well over 4 years. It never failed me once when it came to performance (however, read the last paragraph on my review for some clarification on how the performance is NOW in 2015). 2) WINDOWS 7. I cannot stress this enough. Even now I still consider Windows 7 to be a far superior operating system to Windows 8, 8.1 and perhaps someday even 10. It is both user-friendly but not too dumbed-down and  metro-ified as Windows 8 is. I like the GUI's smooth edges that are both futuristic but not too bubbly and drab like Windows XP was.

I suspect that a lot of these glowing reviews were probably done when the laptop was brand new before it stood the test of time. I have had this laptop since September 2010 and it's now March 2013. At about a year and a half the fan went out. I replaced it, not a big deal in itself. At about the same time the video card started going out. Suddenly while working the video card puts yellow vertical stripes on the monitor while the system freezes and hangs. I have to power off and restart to use the computer again. The yellow stripe freezes/crashes have become more and more frequent. At first it was a couple times a month, now it is once a day or even more. Now I will have to buy another video card. All my other laptops lasted years without any hardware going bad. Planned obsolescence? Cheap parts and build quality? I don't know. The Asus N61JQ-X1 is marketed as USB 3.0, the latest and greatest and  future proof. What they don't tell you is that ONLY ONE of the THREE USB ports is actually USB 3.0 (the single one on the left side). The other two are USB 2",

As long as you aren't an extreme gamer, this system will work for you. The Asus K42jr-a1 runs very smooth and can handle everything I have thrown at it. I used the recovery partition to reinstall on a single partition, but I have heard of just doing a fresh install. This also works. As with many laptops these days, lots of bloatware, but I was aware of this, and cleaned out what I didn't want. If you are a little weary fully deleting programs (even though you have the utility disk), just deactivate the services and stop certain programs from starting at the boot. This will also increase your performance. ****NOTE: When the computer was first booted, it seemed very sluggish. At times, the cpu light was on, but it appeared nothing was happening. Task Manager showed no CPU activity. After a couple minutes, the computer would resume what it was working on. But, this freezing, or sluggish activity would occur every 5 minutes or so. After some research, I found this obscure, but simple solution.",

The only real complaints so far: The short/wide screen is not ideal for viewing some web pages, and the small screen yields fairly small text size on many pages. Despite those minor issues, it is nearly perfect for what I wanted.",

        "input: I have been using this notebook regularly for the past 9 years. I originally purchased the device for its size and portability, but found that it didn't really have the horsepower to keep up with Windows 7 (Starter Edition). After several months, I chose to upgrade the system RAM from 1GB to 2GB, which definitely helped, but it was still pretty laggy, especially when surfing the web. After several years of so-so performance I installed Linux Mint 17 (now 18) on the machine and boy what a difference that made. The netbook went from being a machine that I kept in the bag most of the time to becoming my daily driver. The sluggish, laggy performance with Windows 7 was replaced with snappy, responsive performance that, in conjunction with the small form factor, made the netbook an ideal on-the-go device. I can safely say 9 years after my original purchase that the machine is significantly faster today running Linux Mint than it was when brand new running Windows 7 Starter. My wife and I own a multi-million dollar IT services company, and this netbook has been serving as my primary business  laptop   for the past 5 years. At this juncture I wouldn't trade my old netbook for a brand new device... its become like an old trusted friend.",

        "input: Asus nearly has the netbook PC perfected. The size and ergonomics of this keyboard are bar none the best among netbooks today. The wide touchpad has the right level of sensitivity as well. And Windows 7, even with the entry level Starter edition, offers much faster processing & bootup times than Windows XP does on the Intel Atom N270 processor. However, the Asus Eee 1005HA has its achilles heel in mechanical design. The 250GB HDD has undamped vibrations that pass throughout the chassis and straight into your wrists. The fan also runs excessively. The combination creates high levels of noise and vibration compared to similar netbooks such as the Acer Aspire One D250. Also, even without Anti-Virus software running, Windows 7 and the preloaded software consume 40% of the available 1GB of memory. Asus will undoubtedly be working out the kinks in this netbook, but many users will find the vibration and noise levels to be unacceptable, especially when other manufacturers offer netbooks without these concerns. Once Asus releases a thermally cool, vibrationless version with 2GB DDR2 memory, this netbook will be unstoppable. Update: after exchanging for a second 1005HA, it has the exact same vibration issues. This endemic rather than a one-off dud.",

I use it all day at school and the battery life is really good (way better than my laptop that gives me 15 minutes of battery power) Its Wi-Fi connectivity is excellent. The screen size is good and the keyboard is nice and sturdy. Setup is a breeze even a kid can do it It comes with crappy Windows 7 Starter but I upgraded it to Windows 7 Home Premium the same day i got it. I have customized the setting to my taste and it works really good. It is a great addition to your PC arsenal if you need something nice and portable.

I can't change on Amazon because I bought in US and the Brazilian ASUS support doesn't want to help me. :( About the computer, it was a gift to my wife and she loved it. The battery goes long but 5 hours maximum... 8.5 as advertized, no way! Five hours is enough for us, so, we are happy with it! The keyboard is OK for her (small hands) but not so OK for my (very big hands)... the screen is to small to work all day long, so I do recommend to use as a second notebook (like us)... The performance is OK for office and internet... but, like Michael would say, this is it! Windows 7 started seems good for the atom270 processor but is too much for it to do more than one task at the same time, like copy lots of file and streaming a video (youtube)... so for a second notebook, not bad! Windows 7 starter is a little poor and it doesn't have some configurations. I think if your objective is to access internet in a mall or during a traffic jam, this is the right product.",

I bought it mostly for surfing the web and typing, I'm a writer so the convenience of a netbook was something I really wanted. Overall I've loved the computer. It is small and lightweight, with a sleeve I can carry it in my purse or bookbag. The battery life is a lot better than my old laptop and the power chord is nice and long, so not a hassle to have plugged in when I'm at home. The mousepad works really well, better than some of the other ones I've seen on netbooks. I read in one of the other reviews about the vibrating and noise this computer makes, and I haven't had an issue with that at all. There are a couple things I've noticed to be a hassle on the computer though. The mousepad buttons are sometimes hard to use, though once you get used to it they aren't so bad. When certain programs pop up, like quick info on a product from a website or iTunes, sometimes the screen can't fit it all and there is no way to scroll through. I guess a lot of programs are just made for computers with a larger screen. Windows 7 starter has a lot of limitations, but that's to be expected.

Sound and wireless worked with Fedora, Ubuntu and ArchLinux. I also have an Asus 1000HE. This is a bit smaller and lighter. I give it a 4, rather than a 5, for a few reasons, most of which have been stated in other reviews. It's a fingerprint magnet. The jack for the power cord seems very fragile. The touchpad, and its single bar, rather than a right and left click button, is a nuisance. In Linux at least, I can't use two finger scrolling. The touchpad is bumpy and there's a smooth area to the right that will work for one finger scrolling. Note that this is in Linux, I don't know how it works in Windows. Other than that, it's a netbook. It's small, not that powerful, but fine for browsing, reading ebooks, skype (though probably better with headphones), documents and the like. It's pretty similar to the 1000HE, with the upside of less size and weight, plus a better keyboard (full size right hand shift key this time), but with a flimsier connector from power cord to computer and that touch pad. I remember years ago, the Gateway Arc 200 (an ultralight--but not a netbook, it was rather expensive at the time) had the middle mouse button as a little wheel on a bar above the touchpad. I've never seen it since, but for me, at least, it was the most convenient trackpad equivalent of a mouse button that I've used.",

Kicking into a higher performance mode takes a few seconds and leaves you with a little under half of the maximum battery life. The touchpad is a bit unconventional and I'm still getting used to it. It is completely level with the surface of the laptop and I have found my fingers like to wander off the edges of the usable area. The instant-on splashtop was a nice surprise. I wasn't even aware of the functionality when I purchased the computer. The applications are very basic and the music player rates pretty low on the intuitive features list but it does play music after you have your playlists set up. Though it is fairly big, it's just as thin and lightweight. I don't plan to do any serious gaming on the computer, but I do play EVE. It ran quite well with the G210M on. I have only had this product for about a day but so far I'm very happy with it.",

        "input: I give only 3 stars to this laptop because it uses a cheap processor. The Intel T6600 processor costs less, which is why laptops with this type of CPU cost less, but that is at the expense of some pretty important features. The biggest problem is that this laptop's CPU does not support Hardware Assisted Virtualization (VT). This means you cant use the XP mode offered by Windows 7 Ultimate. You cant run VM's on the majority of Virtualization products (VMWARE, VirtualPC). There is a workaround for XP mode by using VMLite, but this is the single biggest weak point of this laptop. Otherwise I find it ok. Returning this laptop for lack of VT means Amazon will charge their usual 15% restocking fee and its not worth that. My advise is that if you are a serious user who likes advanced features, look around for a laptop with a better processor. If you are looking for a cheap system with reasonable specs then choose this. You will never be able to enjoy Win 7 Ultimate (with all its features) on this laptop. Caveat Emptor.",

Has bluetooth, HDMI, Wireless a/b/g/n and 2.2GHZ cpu, lighted keyboard and multitouch touchpad, all good to have besides the usual base feature set. Appears too glossy for me and certainly a fingerprint magnet. The mousepad could have been better designed. It's a little bit too small and the clicker feels awkward, but I guess I might get used to it soon. The screen looks very good but the default setup was a little too bright so I adjusted it down a little. Runs pretty cool and reasonably quiet. Compared side by side with a Sony VGN-SR390 13.3in and I liked the looks of the Sony better. But the U80V is about 500.00 cheaper and the Sony's keyboard is not lighted. I choose the ASUS for features and value but honestly my heart was with the Sony. :-) Even though advertised as thin, the ASUS is not that thin at about 1.3 in, but comfortable to sit on my laptop and type while watching TV.

I did not wanted to make the same mistake that I made the last time by buying an underpowered pc. This ASUS N61JQ-A1 has a lot of power and it is a beautiful system. Something that I was concern about when I bough it on-line was the color. On line is described as being a dark brown. It is dark brown but it is so dark that it looks black and in addition the pattern in the design is awesome. I bough mine at Costco on-line because they offer the best return policy that I know of and they had the best price I could find.

HUGE screen - yet fairly light Not very hot- no more burned wrists (although it is quite hot back towards the screen... so watch your laps!!!) and... last... but not least!!!! IT IS CHEAP (for what it is)... I tried to buy it here, but thought about it too long, and missed the half a C-note under a G, but was still in time for the end of cashback from MS - I sure will miss that program. Cons: ASUS bloatware - easily remedied awkward placement of power plug - I like laying the laptop down on it's side - and this doesn't allow me to. as others have noted - it will be covered with fingerprints... again- who cares. Wireless N is single band (only 2.4, no 5ghz) All in all - I could not be more pleased...

This laptop has been my faithful companion for well over 4 years, throughout the end of middle school and much of my High School life. This laptop is special to me, as it has been the first one I'd ever gotten that actually ran the games I wanted to play effectively (my two previous laptops were Dell notebooks and they sucked real bad at gaming). The good things about this laptop: 1) Decent for running games made from at latest 2012 to older (portal 2, skyrim, and anything older run great). Runs smoothly and is capable of handling stressful loads (or at least I remember it being that way). I had a lot of fun times playing games using this laptop for well over 4 years. It never failed me once when it came to performance (however, read the last paragraph on my review for some clarification on how the performance is NOW in 2015). 2) WINDOWS 7. I cannot stress this enough. Even now I still consider Windows 7 to be a far superior operating system to Windows 8, 8.1 and perhaps someday even 10. It is both user-friendly but not too dumbed-down and  metro-ified as Windows 8 is. I like the GUI's smooth edges that are both futuristic but not too bubbly and drab like Windows XP was.

I suspect that a lot of these glowing reviews were probably done when the laptop was brand new before it stood the test of time. I have had this laptop since September 2010 and it's now March 2013. At about a year and a half the fan went out. I replaced it, not a big deal in itself. At about the same time the video card started going out. Suddenly while working the video card puts yellow vertical stripes on the monitor while the system freezes and hangs. I have to power off and restart to use the computer again. The yellow stripe freezes/crashes have become more and more frequent. At first it was a couple times a month, now it is once a day or even more. Now I will have to buy another video card. All my other laptops lasted years without any hardware going bad. Planned obsolescence? Cheap parts and build quality? I don't know. The Asus N61JQ-X1 is marketed as USB 3.0, the latest and greatest and  future proof. What they don't tell you is that ONLY ONE of the THREE USB ports is actually USB 3.0 (the single one on the left side). The other two are USB 2",

As long as you aren't an extreme gamer, this system will work for you. The Asus K42jr-a1 runs very smooth and can handle everything I have thrown at it. I used the recovery partition to reinstall on a single partition, but I have heard of just doing a fresh install. This also works. As with many laptops these days, lots of bloatware, but I was aware of this, and cleaned out what I didn't want. If you are a little weary fully deleting programs (even though you have the utility disk), just deactivate the services and stop certain programs from starting at the boot. This will also increase your performance. ****NOTE: When the computer was first booted, it seemed very sluggish. At times, the cpu light was on, but it appeared nothing was happening. Task Manager showed no CPU activity. After a couple minutes, the computer would resume what it was working on. But, this freezing, or sluggish activity would occur every 5 minutes or so.

I have high arches and I really take into consideration about the negative effects running has and I try my best to take preventative measures against them.  What really enticed me to switch brands and purchase these shoes, besides the reputable brand ASICS is, was the fact that they had GEL cushioning. After receiving these shoes they felt really great and my first run in them was like running on air; pumped out a 7 minute mile.  After the 2nd run my calves really started to cramp up...  After ruling out dehydration, environmental factors, and substituting in orthodics I determined that these shoes were the cause of having to cut my runs short.  After further analysis of the shoe I realized that the heel was lifted slightly higher than my other running shoes.  ASICS are just not made for me.  I went and purchased some new Under Armour shoes and they just work GREAT!  I guess it's all about finding what brand best suites you.

The water flow feels low at first but I think it is the best volume to conserve water instead of running it at full speed and wasting a lot of water.\\n\\nThe only issue is that if somehow you drop water on top of the faucet once it dries it is going to show horrible watermarks. It is cleanable and disappears easily when wiped but the look is annoying. Other than that it is a great faucet.",

        "review_body: The product is satisfactory. The burner has the exact same configuration and markings as the broken one it replaced except where the model number was etched into the 'y' frame of the original burner there is a gind-off mark on the new one as if the model number was erased. It seems as if this Camco brand is just the Chromalox brand repackaged with the trade marks removed. I was a bit disappointed because Camco's web page explained that their burners had more coil turns than some other brands, and that is what made it 'deluxe'. When the new burner arrived it had the same number of turns (5) as the original. The picture is not accurate for this item because it clearly depicts 6 turns. Maybe the picture corresponds to the large size 8-inch burners. In any case, the quality is equal to the original and it is functional. I do not perceive anything about it that merits the 'deluxe' adjective.",

        "review_body: I bought this Samyang lens for Nikon under the Vivitar brand. Also available as Rokinon, Bower, and others -- buy the one going for the lowest price.\\n\\nAt F1.4 the lens is sharp in the center, but soft at the corners and edges. Noticeable vignetting that is correctable in post-processing. CA is negligible. By F2.8 the lens is sharp corner to corner and vignetting is not visible on my D810. Focusing is spot-on without camera fine-tuning. Focus ring has long rotation (nearly half a turn) and is well damped so focusing is a joy. There is a small amount of barrel distortion that can be seen if you shoot fences or buildings, but it should be easy to correct. Like other Samyang lenses, there is no lock for the aperture ring. If want to control aperture by the ring, it is difficult to reach and hard to turn, I guess that makes it better if you want it to stay at F22!\\n\\nCompared with my other Samyang manufactured lenses, this Vivitar branded lens came with a padded nylon bag rather than cloth, and a lens cleaning cloth, as well as a nicer instruction manual that was Nikon specific. I don't know if these improvements apply to any other rebranding or the Samyang original.",

        "review_body: This is a very good laptop at this price. The laptop is loaded with a lot of features some of which are only found in high-end machines. I would particularly like to point out the i5 processor and the solid-state hard drive. Add that to the 8GB RAM and it makes this a lightning-fast machine for any work. It has a high-resolution screen and a pretty decent battery life. The laptop comes with Windows 10 Pro pre-installed. It is very light in weight and you don't even feel the weight in the backpack. It also has a touchscreen and fingerprint scanner. Although for me they are not of much use and seem like a marketing gimmick. But some people may like to have these features. The only regret I have is that the 8GB DDR4 RAM is soldered to the board and hence there is no possibility of upgrading the RAM even if you want to. Other than this, it is a great laptop and comes at a low price. I would recommend it.",

CHARGE THE PHONE, IT WAS DEAD WHEN I GOT MINE, TAKES 2 HOURS. YOU PUSH THE BOTTOM BUTTON FOR 2 SECONDS TO POWER ON THE WATCH. PAIR IT WITH YOUR PHONE( Bluetooth on ok). EASY. NOW THE PART NOT IN THE INSTRUCTIONS ANYWHERE. PLEASE READ: QUICK PRESS OF TOP BUTTON ON RH SIDE OF THE WATCH AND YOU GET GOOGLE ASSISTANT NOT ALEXA. I LOOKED EVERYWHERE AND COULD NOT GET ALEXA TO ANSWER. HERES THE TRICK, HOLD THE TOP BUTTON DOWN! BOOM ALEXA IS THERE. WOW THAT NEEDS ADDED TO THE MANUAL. WATCH IS GREAT, MANUAL SUCKS. Its great. It has a lot of cool features without looking like a TV strapped to your wrist. Looks like a large watch, a nice large watch that is a little heavy but not too bad. I would recommend this product. Cons: can't play music from Amazon. Seems limited a bit. It would be nice if I could get it to talk to my Dot and Fire TV. I'm still looking to see if that's possible. I just got the watch so if I figure that out I will add it to this review later. I want a real help section, the basics are there but my God you don't even show us how to talk to Alexa, the reason we bought this model of smart watch. That's kinda stupid. This watch does a lot more than it says so poke around and try things. It's a quality piece. I can't understand why people build all these features into smart phones and watches and never tell anyone. Why would ya do that? Anyway yep buy this if you want an Alexa watch. The speaker is tiny so she sounds a little muffled but you can hear her just fine. We finally have a real Dick Tracy watch! Enjoy. Edit: I found the real owners manual. Go to the Guess app on your phone. Settings-Help and Support-Owners Manual. There is the real manual. There should have been a printed copy of that included in the box, thats too hard to find.

        "review_body: I purchased this watch from an authorized Baume & Mercier dealer. I did so because they added one year to the warranty and do all of the repairs and maintenance (if needed) on site. In addition, they did give me a nice reduction in price, which I have found is not unusual for upscale watches. Okay, it isn't as good a price as I could get on line, but this is not a gray market watch and comes with a full U.S. warranty. Often, the discounted watches are gray market and do not come with an American warranty. I looked at other watches, including one by Tag Heuer and also Mont Blanc. But when I saw them in person, I found that they looked like very expensive sports watches. To be sure, they were very fine looking. But for me I find that the Baume & Mercier looks more elegant. This is a watch that I will not wear daily (I am very active in the high Rockies ... wearing a Baume & Mercier while backcountry skiing at 12,000 ft altitude is sort of over the top). I have recently purchased a watch winder so that the watch will not loose time while it sits in its case. This has been a great purchase, looks wonderful, and is a great anniversary gift for me!",

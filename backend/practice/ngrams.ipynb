When I called Tech support, I was informed that it was not campatible with my operating system. When I pointed out I was using Win 98se on a Compaq comupter they tried to help. I was able to finally get it installed after being on the phone with Tech Support for almost 2 hours. It worked for one day then quit printing. When I again called Tech Support and spent another hour on the phone the printer finally started working but the Scanner quit. As I was buying a second computer with Win XP I asked if it would be compatible and was assured that it was.\\nWhen I was ready to install the A1500 on the new computer, I called Tech Support and they taslked me through the whole process. Not only would it not install it crashed my system and I had to do a full restore.\\nAs I waited to long to return it, it is now seating on a shelf collecting dust until I can find someone who will take it off my hands. In the mean time I`m still looking for a good multifunction that will work as advertised.\\nI would not recommend the A1500 to anyone who does not have money and time to waste.\"\n",

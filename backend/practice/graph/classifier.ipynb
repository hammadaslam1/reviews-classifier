Simple installation without any problems, excellent photo quality resolution even on plain paper, very good managing software and the best part is, I didn't need any customer support to make it run :). Very good product with excellent features, quality and resolution. Believe me it's better than the best available in this price range.\",\n",

When I called Tech support, I was informed that it was not campatible with my operating system. When I pointed out I was using Win 98se on a Compaq comupter they tried to help. I was able to finally get it installed after being on the phone with Tech Support for almost 2 hours. It worked for one day then quit printing. When I again called Tech Support and spent another hour on the phone the printer finally started working but the Scanner quit. As I was buying a second computer with Win XP I asked if it would be compatible and was assured that it was. When I was ready to install the A1500 on the new computer, I called Tech Support and they taslked me through the whole process. Not only would it not install it crashed my system and I had to do a full restore. As I waited to long to return it, it is now seating on a shelf collecting dust until I can find someone who will take it off my hands. In the mean time I`m still looking for a good multifunction that will work as advertised. I would not recommend the A1500 to anyone who does not have money and time to waste.',\n",

It was also somewhat difficult to make copies of smaller items such as cards, IDs or pictures, even with the protective sleeve that is included with this model. Before Compaq was bought out by HP, there was Compaq Customer Communities where consumers could post questions and give answers to one another (I had an alignment problem with this unit that was easily solved by a visit to Customer Communities).  Unfortunately, HP removed the community.  I guess it's a good thing I got the 3 year warranty from Circuit City.  After about a year and a half, the scanner and copier started to act up.

When I first purchased it, I thought the design was great, but as I needed copies and scans of different items, I changed my mind.  The copier/scanner is operated via a feeder instead of being a flatbed.  I couldn't scan a page from a book or magazine (unless I wanted to rip out the page and feed it to the machine).  It was also somewhat difficult to make copies of smaller items such as cards, IDs or pictures, even with the protective sleeve that is included with this model. Before Compaq was bought out by HP, there was Compaq Customer Communities where consumers could post questions and give answers to one another (I had an alignment problem with this unit that was easily solved by a visit to Customer Communities).  Unfortunately, HP removed the community.  I guess it's a good thing I got the 3 year warranty from Circuit City.  After about a year and a half, the scanner and copier started to act up.  I would no longer get clean scans/copies, and it would use two 8.5' x 11' pages to copy a single document with the same dimensions.  Customer Service couldn't help with the problem\"]  # Replace with actual feature values\n",

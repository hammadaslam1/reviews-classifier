      "Too small and doesn't dry  the clothes\n",
      "I used this to keep hot chocolate warm for a Christmas event outdoor with my kids. It stored easily in a bag cooler, poured easily, & saved money. I might put a cold drink in it for them in the summer when out in the heat.\n",
      "Got this for my dad who's updating his home before selling. Beautiful design. Easy to install according to my father and younger brother.\n",
      "This review is for Peerless P2635LF-BN Parkwood Two Handle Lavatory Faucet Centerset, Brushed Nickel The installation was easy. The supply lines are included which helped the installation process a lot, the only struggle was to remove the old one. The nobs operate very smoothly don't require any effort to open or close and it is easy to set up the temperature. It looks really nice. I like the height not too tall or short. The water flow feels low at first but I think it is the best volume to conserve water instead of running it at full speed and wasting a lot of water. The only issue is that if somehow you drop water on top of the faucet once it dries it is going to show horrible watermarks. It is cleanable and disappears easily when wiped but the look is annoying. Other than that it is a great faucet.\n",
      "Don't you hate it when you have a faucet that leaks, you have fixed it multiple times over the years and it starts dripping again.  Eventually you get to the point that all you want to do is rip out the old faucet and install a new one.  That happened to me with not one, but two faucets recently.  So, when I saw this Peerless faucet in my Vine reviewer queue, I leapt at the chance to try it out. The installation was completely textbook.  The top piece fit my sink perfectly.  The spigot and handle piece was easy to install.  I love that the threads on the mounting tubes went high enough to allow things to snug up nicely on my enamel-covered steel sink - it's not as thick as a ceramic sink - I've had problems with this in the past. If you have any experience replacing this kind of hardware, the installation should take you around 15-30 minutes (once you have the old hardware removed). The instructions are easy to follow...the figures and narrative text are both well done. Once in place, I love how they look. I do have one complaint that to me looks like a design flaw.  Once you have the entire thing installed, the rod (which is angled - I hate this) that you raise to lower the drain, rotates about 45 degrees to the right.  I mean, everything works just fine, but I guess I'm OCD enough that this bugs me enough to cost this product one star. It's now been in place and action for a couple of weeks.  No problems except for the one mentioned above. 4 stars\n",
      "Very nice faucet, came with great instructions and was super easy to install.\n",
      "I installed this faucet in my mom's bathroom. It took longer to remove the old faucet than it did to install this one. It is very well made and looks great.\n",
      "We have hardwater and even with a water softener it takes a toll on all plumbing fixtures. This provided a nice upgrade/update to a much cleaner look than the old brass fixture. Installation was straight forward. Everything except silicone and plumber's tape was included in the box. Very nice economical fixture.\n",
      "Just updating fixtures in the bathroom - most door pulls and knobs are satin or brushed nickel, so went with that for the faucet as well. This was easy to install, but be sure to have plumbing silicone on hand and ready. The old sink had a rubber seal for the drain fitting, so I overlooked that initially when installing this. Otherwise this just dropped in and was an easy install. The slightly higher rise of the faucet is nice, and the faucet handles move very smoothly allowing for great control of water volume. The drain stopper doesn't pull down flush and tight, but the rubber seal still holds water. I think it's by design that it doesn't pull down tight so you don't crush the rubber seal. My only complaint is the aerator is fully plastic, so I accidentally cross threaded it when I tried to put it back in after flushing the faucet. Removing it and reinstalling it fixed the problem, but I'm mildly concerned with longevity.\n",
      "This was my first time installing a bathroom faucet. I was told by others that it's very easy and takes around 20 minutes. Well, it probably took me closer to 2 hours. But I got it done and only needed a wrench and pliers. I guess having silicone on hand would be ideal to make sure it's all water-tight, but I did not have this and just used what was left from my previous faucet. My previous faucet was an ugly (in my opinion) and outdated Peerless set and came with my house 5 years ago... so no telling how old it actually was. It was about time I got something more attractive and more my style. This was perfect in looks for what I wanted in my bathroom. I figured not having done these before that going with another Peerless brand faucet of the same general shape was the safest. It fit nearly perfect where the other had been. The drain is a bit narrower than the previous Peerless drain. And the main base part is shaped a little different, wider in parts and smaller in others, but overall it was close. I took the whole old thing out, besides the pipes and hoses as this didn't include replacements for those. I followed the directions diligently and often rereading it over because I didn't quite understand. But I do not believe I made any mistakes in the long run. At first the rubbery gasket underneath wasn't tightened enough and leaked when I turned the main back on (as I don't have a shut off under the sink). Fortunately I didn't turn on the water yet as the directions had told me to. And when I did turn it on, I thought to have the drain plugged at the time so it was slow... but potentially that's why it leaked more. However I got that sorted out and tightened it much better. I had a bit of an issue lining up the lever well and in the end find the plug and the stopper lever in back of it to be quite wiggly. On my old faucet the lever rested snuggly on the top... this one is wiggles either direction in the back and doesn't really have a resting place. You also have to lift it higher to get it to seal. Overall I'm pretty pleased with this. It's nice looking. And I'm happy I didn't have to hire someone to install. I am NOT a handy person... if I could install this just about anyone can!\n",
      "neck is loose and now the handle is sticking, I have installed 1000 faucets and haven't come across one this bad. This thing hasn't even been used...  garbage\n",
      "I really love the new faucet. I have a pedestal sink and was dreading replacing the faucet since everything I read up to two weeks ago stated I'd have to remove everything. Well, I found instructions that helped me keep the sink in place during replacement and was successful. This faucet is beautiful. My old faucet drain piece was rusting and peeling and definitely wasn't stainless steel under the chrome coating. this one seems to be much much better qualit and I'm hoping it will outlast us in this house. It looks great, the instructions are clear enough (I also had those separate instructions about the sink itself) and it entirely changes the look of my guest bathroom. Yes, it's a simple basic design, but the finish is so nice, that I'm thrilled with it. Highly recommended, no leaks so far!  I've had a peerless sink in my kitchen for years that worked well. That is recently replaced, too, but I was happy with the brand. It is an excellent quality affordable faucet option that is as well-made as the more expensive brands.\n",
      "Very shiny and perfect fit. Really made the old stove look 10 years younger.\n",
      "So so\n",
      "For the price, It works great. Has fewer coils than the stock burners. Home depot wanted $40 for replacement burners! We opted for these and they work fine.\n",
      "Fits on my older electric stove. Can't ask for more.\n",
      "It has only FOUR turns, not six as pictured, and the element is narrower than the one I replaced.  Nothing deluxe about it.  It works, but I'll definitely shop around for a heavier element.\n",
      "The product is satisfactory. The burner has the exact same configuration and markings as the broken one it replaced except where the model number was etched into the 'y' frame of the original burner there is a gind-off mark on the new one as if the model number was erased. It seems as if this Camco brand is just the Chromalox brand repackaged with the trade marks removed. I was a bit disappointed because Camco's web page explained that their burners had more coil turns than some other brands, and that is what made it 'deluxe'. When the new burner arrived it had the same number of turns (5) as the original. The picture is not accurate for this item because it clearly depicts 6 turns. Maybe the picture corresponds to the large size 8-inch burners. In any case, the quality is equal to the original and it is functional. I do not perceive anything about it that merits the 'deluxe' adjective.'\n",
      "i was in a rental, and accidentally melted a plastic bowl onto the stove.  rather than have the landloard charge me a fortune for damage, i easily replaced it myself, cheaper than i thought it would be!\n",
      "You gave the measurments incorrectly....the first number is always the width not the depth so I had to return it. Hope I get my money back because it would not fit. Thanks, Rich Romanello\n",
      "I just bought this a couple of weeks ago. It is great so far.  It holds either small bottles or large bottles of wine.  If you use large bottles, you just have to remove the shelf above.  It keeps the wine cool and is quiet.  The only draw back was that it was too tall to put on the counter if you have over counter cabinets.  I put it on a small table in the utility room.  It is a perfect size otherwise.\n",
      "We have been very pleased with our wine cooler.  If I were to have any criticisms of it, it would be that it can be hard to fit  wine bottles that are bigger around into some shelves.  It doesn't always chill a wine as much as we prefer but that's more a personal preference since we like some of our wines to be cooler.\n",
      "As other reviewers have mentioned, the listed dimensions are way off. Our 8-bottle cooler is 19.5 inches deep (meaning from front to back), 16 inches wide, and 10 inches high. The picture of the 8-bottle cooler is misleading because it doesn't really show how deep the unit is, and because of that, it won't fit many kitchen counters, including ours. We keep it on a small table in a nook that luckily was just the right size, otherwise we'd have no place for it. So measure your counter before you buy. Other than that, it has worked perfectly for us for about 6 weeks now and we really like it. We've been able to adjust temperature (we keep between 53 and 60 depending on contents) and it responds well. It's very quiet, almost completely silent, and no problems getting standard wine bottles to fit. I was concerned when we first turned it on because it did not seem to cool, but it just took a while for it to adjust and set itself.  Since then we've had no problems. Important: Read the simple & brief instruction manual before you turn it on.\n",
      "I bought this unit last year right before Christmas from Walmart. A week ago it started to beep with lights flashing and as mentioned in other reviews the only way to stop it is to unplug it. The owner Manual doesn't help. Glad I got it on sale. Piece of garbage.  Save your money and store the ones you want chilled in the refrigerator.\n",
      "Don't waste your money on this! I'd give this negative stars if I could. It rarely got to 50° and when it did get to 50°, that only lasted for a day or two after we got it. After that, it held steady at about 65-70° but would not get any lower, ever, no matter how many times we set it. Now it completely stopped working after not owning it for very long. So it's just a waste of space now.\n",
      "I bought three of these last night at WalMart for $39 a piece. Added a 2 year WalMart warranty for $4 each. I loved the size and how they could actually fit 8 real bottles, including burgundy style bottles. The size is perfect for my application. I plugged them in and after about 2 hours, they were at 55F. I loaded one with 8 Italian-style bottles (long and skinny) and they fit very well! The other two I took out the bottom rack and put a magnum in sideways WITH 7 other bottles! The temp shot up to 65 on all of them (ambient temp + warm wine bottles), but they slowly fell to 55 over a few hours, which is better for wine. I hope these last a long time, since they are great for my application. I will come back in 6 months and do a follow-up. As of right now, they are working like champs!\n",
      "We have had this unit for almost one year. We have it set for 55 degrees, and it keeps that temperature nailed. We have it set on a kitchen counter, adjacent to our ovens, but with the specified clearances for air flow at the sides and back. No complaints at all. We are considering purchasing a second one to give us more storage for red wines.\n",
      "I've had my cellar frig for almost 2 years- works great actually I got 2 of them for my space. it is a wine cellar not cooler. if you want a cold wine then just get a small refrig, not a wine cellar refrig! it keeps wine at cellar temps. perfect for maintaining wines. when I'm ready to drink a white ...then I transfer to my main frig to cool it down to what I like to drink it at. good price.\n",
      "This product has been okay for us. While it chills wine and seems to be made of great quality, we have had weekly trouble with it leaking water from the back. Not sure what the problem is but at the price we paid, I don't think we should have to deal with leaking water. Just saying...\n",
      "This is a piece of junk. It can barely keep wine cool in the winter with the heat off. The fan runs all the time no matter what. Furthermore, when the room temperature is a tad bit above 70 degrees, the light starts flashing along with a constant beeping. The only way to stop this, is to unplug it. The manufacturer offers no suggestion other than saying it's probably the pc. In my mind 'pc' is personal computer, not microprocessor which is probably what is controlling the light flashing and beeping. The manufacturer offers no method of getting a unit which is properly working, even though they shipped the original flashing and beeping unit. They consider it yours because you, well, opened their box. This is the kind of treatment that gives a bad name to internet shopping.'\n",
      "Nothing fancy, but simple enough to install and works so far.\n",
      "The stopper does it's job for what I want it to do.  It hasn't fallen off the wall.  You install it by poking the screw through the little pinhole... Yes, I was trying to pull it apart until I realize that the screw can fit through that hole.  Not plastic, feels like good quality!  No directions were included in the package... guess it should be self explanatory. LOL.\n",
      "Got this item for behind one of my doors that would hit the wall in a very specific spot (from the handle) & it was great. Fit perfect, easy to put up & problem was solved.\n",
      "Looks brown or bronze.... not BLACK!!!i ordered specifically BLACK. Ugh\n",
      "Easy to use and works for extending down rods.\n",
      "Works great to join two rods together.  Overpriced though for a small metal piece.\n",
      "Had to modify it (no fault of the product) and it then worked as advertised.\n",
      "Bought a new condensor fan and motor and the company through this in for $4.99. In my not very scientific study, I would estimate that it removed about 15-20% of the dust, dog hair, etc from the bottom of the refrigerator but every little bit helps when it comes to maintaining proper air flow from front to back. On the upside, I've discovered that a strip of wire window screen placed behind the removable grille makes a lot more sense and could make me a millionaire.\n",
      "Contrary to the photos for this item, it is not made to bend like shown in the photo. So if you are looking for a brush to reach around the corner you will just have to hope the wire under the bristles is flexible enough to do the trick.\n",
      "Great product\n",
      "This has been lighting my furnace for years now with no problems.\n",
      "Will be back for other add ones as needed.\n",
      "Good!\n",
      "work and fits my model fridge\n",
      "Product was in excellent condition. Works perfect!\n",
      "Fit just like a factory new part and I was back up and running in no time!\n",
      "Fit old fans and look so much better\n",
      "Ordered it based on the description and True item manufacture number and received the drain bottle (which is what I wanted). The picture showing a tower hose is wrong ordered on 1.14.19.\n",
      "I was trying them out for my cleaning business and decided that they would work fine; went to order more and they almost doubled the cost!!  Very disappointed when I saw that.  They did work as good as the name brand ones though.\n",
      "Blades fit very well. We replaced the straw type blades with these. With the increased weight, the fan spins a little more once you shut it off, but that's just physics. Very quiet operation especially compared to the previous blades.\n",
      "Easy upgrade, I was able to swap out the old palm leaf fan blades with these in 10 minutes. Now the fan actually feels cool and runs much quieter.\n",
      "These beautiful real wood fan blades not only look good, but they are a perfect match for the palm leaf straw type blades that came with the fan originally, which were damaged through use. These blades have the mounting holes in the exact same place as the old blades and also have grooves cut into the blades that perfectly fit the mounting hardware. The actual color is as shown in the add picture and looks fantastic mounted on the fan.\n",
      "I bought this Samyang lens for Nikon under the Vivitar brand. Also available as Rokinon, Bower, and others -- buy the one going for the lowest price.\n",
      "\n",
      "At F1.4 the lens is sharp in the center, but soft at the corners and edges. Noticeable vignetting that is correctable in post processing. CA is negligible. By F2.8 the lens is sharp corner to corner and vignetting not visible on my D810. Focusing is spot-on without camera fine tuning. Focus ring has long rotation (nearly half a turn) and is well damped so focusing is a joy. There is a small amount of barrel distortion that can be seen if you shoot fences or buildings, but it should be easy to correct. Like other Samyang lenses, there is no lock for the aperture ring. If want to control aperture by the ring, it is difficult to reach and hard to turn, I guess that makes it better if you want it to stay at F22!\n",
      "\n",
      "Compared with my other Samyang manufactured lenses, this Vivitar branded lens came with a padded nylon bag rather than cloth, and a lens cleaning cloth, as well as a nicer instruction manual that was Nikon specific. I don't know if these improvements apply to any other rebranding or the Samyang original.\n",
      "very sharp lens even wide open.\n",
      "Sick lens, sick price.\n",
      "great lens.. looks incredible! will buy 2 more of each\n",
      "Favorite lens I've ever used... including my three L-series lenses\n",
      "Sharp fast lens. I'd buy another.\n",
      "Excellent lens, no autofocus, no VR very sharp\n",
      "I love this lens, it has proven to be tough and versatile for both video and photo\n",
      "Best lens ever for a true photographer/ filmaker. It is my favorite of my collection. Damn auto focus!\n",
      "Sharp all the way through!\n",
      "I used this len at a wedding and the sharpness of the video was awesome.\n",
      "Love my 50mm lens but I want to get in closer to someone or something and still have that sharpness, this lens does just that for me.\n",
      ": I am not a pro but I do weddings and portraits I do have to say the colour is absolutely marvellous. Unless you don't practice with it you would not get stunning results .\n",
      "The delivery was perfect, the product is in top shape but que lense's hood isn't the original and the one I received is loose. But works fine !\n",
      "I've used this lens for some really important shoots and I'm very happy with the results.  Samyang offers some great value for their product and this is by far the best Samyang Lens I've bought.  Although it's been released for a while, I've used it with my Nikon D750 for photography and video.\n",
      "Optically the lens is great, and the build quality is outstanding. The only thing wrong is that the hood falls off during normal use. With just a 35mm focal length, the lens hood is a must and I need to tape it into place, or it will fall off.\n",
      "Sharp, decently built, but very hard to focus consistently. I'll admit it - I have to have electronic focus!\n",
      "In my back pack i've got just fixed focals  but this one so far is awesome the contrast, sharpness, bokeh  is incredible too mucho colorfull than the 50 mm 1,4 perhaps the 85mm 1,8 gets closer. the 14 mm 2.8 also from the same brand under the opteka name makes a great job but this one become my favorite\n",
      "The lens I received was very soft, so I returned it for a refund, which took almost a month to get after emailing the the company almost every day for a month. Wouldn't recommend.\n",
      "Thought that this lens would provide that extra measure of tack sharpness expected from a prime lens over a zoom. Some of the reviews rave about the sharpness and thought I was making a good choice. Don't mind a manual focus lens and occasionally use an old 50mm super takumar, which is manual focus and aperture. Can't say this lens is bad, but its sharpness is inferior to my old super takumar and I would say no better than the 18-200 zoom I'm using at 35mm. I gain a couple of f stops but I was buying the lens more for supposed sharpness.\n",
      "What can I say....  this is one of the sharpest, best low light lenses I've had the pleasure of owning.  My entire lens bag includes nothing but Canon lenses, I love the cinematic look they give.  That being said, this lens works better in low light than any of the Canon's by far.  The build quality is insane, and the focussing ring is ultra wide and smooth.  I use this with my 5D Mark II & III.\n",
      "This lens is sharp with great contrast. If you can manage manual focus, then this is a superb lens at an affordable price. This and the 135 mm are my go to lenses. Build quality is sturdy. This is also a very fast lens that provides wonderful bokeh.\n",
      "I really love this lens. I'd give it 5 stars. Got it on sale with the 85mm version too. It takes great photos, great color, great sharpness, distortion is minimal, it's everything you would want. Built well, works great. The gotcha- I love this one, I really dislike the 85mm. So, I don't know if that is the model differences- or possibly just poor quality control across the line. So deducting a star for that. I dislike like 85 so much, I don't even feel I should re-sell it. But my 35mm copy is fantastic.\n",
      "All I have to say is, if this lens is used correctly, stunning results can be achieved. If you don't need autofocus, this lens is definitely a great performer. Don't shy away from using manual focusing, it gets easier as you practice more; I find it quite enjoyable actually. It is very sharp from f/4 - f/10, and not too bad for apertures larger than f/4. Build quality is extremely solid and the focus ring is well dampened. Just look at the weight of this thing and you will know what I'm talking about. It feels good in the hand with high quality plastic casing; it does NOT feel cheap, but rather suggest a higher price tag. To wrap things up, this is a great everyday lens when used properly. Understand the limitations of this lens and work around it, you can achieve great photos.\n",
      "Nice quality\n",
      "Works as expected.\n",
      "Says it works with g7x 2 camera hardly fits.\n",
      "Though a bit snug, this case offers very good protection.\n",
      "Perfect for the Nikon 9900.\n",
      "The Belt Loop ripped off the first day I had it.\n",
      "An excellent case but could use an outside pocket.\n",
      "Despite the advertised claim, it's too small and does not fit the Nikon Coolpix S9900. However, it was a fast and easy prepaid return and refund.\n",
      "Bought this for my new Canon Powershot G7X Mark II camera. It's a very tight fit, and quite cumbersome to get the camera in and out of the case.\n",
      "Really liked this small bag. fits well. protects my camera very well too. Thank you\n",
      "The camera case did not fit the camera as stated!\n",
      "Because of the tight fit, the threading holding the seams of the case together fell apart after one week of use!\n",
      "Really tight fit. Probably won't use it.\n",
      "Fast shipping and as described.  Very nice \"small\" case and fit my Canon Powershot G7 perfectly!\n",
      "I hate it because I have not received my  refund, as promised  almost a week ago,  A very, very small amount, but a principle is involved and  have no other recourse but this.\n",
      "I LOST IT AND IT'S HARD TO BRING YOUR CAMERA OUT\n",
      "Great Item\n",
      "Stay away from Metgear products at all costs.  These cases make it sound like they will work on so many cameras but the trust is that it hasn’t been tested and probably won’t work on your camera.  Much better products out there in the market.\n",
      "Fits my canon G7x like a glove.\n",
      "It's practice but offer poor protection.\n",
      "The actual dimensions are one 1.5 x 4 x 2.5. Not  even close to wat the description says and not nearly big enough to fit the G7X Mark 2. Clearly they never tried to put the camera in the case before they listed it in the title. Very irritating.\n",
      "Perfect \"snug\" fit for the Canon G7x Mark II, padded for some protection and a belt loop for a mounting option...can't complain!\n",
      "Not a good fit for my Canon G7 Mk II. Very tight and awkward to get the camera into and out of the case. I will be returning it.\n",
      "Fits my Canon G7X with a spare battery perfectly. If you want small, cushioned and well fitting this is the one.\n",
      "It fits mi Canon G7X like a glove, providing good protection\n",
      "It also has a clip I can attach to my belt for extra comfort\n",
      "I bought it for my Canon G7 Mark II since it's written in the description that this case fits the camera. Well, it doesn't.\n",
      "The case is too tight and has a fold that makes it very difficult to pull the camera out. I will have to buy another case.\n",
      "Good tight fit.  In fact it's TOO good.  If it's on your belt, it takes two hands, torquing your body awkwardly, to cram it in the case.  Once in, it's like it's been swallowed up.  When you see that must have shot and you need to get the camera quickly, good luck.  It takes another two hands to get it out.  I'm sending it back and I never send stuff back, but this is horrible.  Avoid.\n",
      "The right size with a good quality. It has a decent look and feel and gets the job done\n",
      "Lost my camera case on a recent trip. This case fit nicely and will protect my camera, which is what I wanted. Nice case for the price.\n",
      "Exactly what I was looking for, just enough protection, easy clip that I can attach to my belt loops (since I don't wear belts). Plus it is soft enough to stuff in my pocket while using the camera.\n",
      "Bought this for a Canon G7X as that camera was listed in the description. If you think you're going to wear this thing on your belt and pull your camera out for a quick pic when needed, then you  have another thing coming. It fits very tight on this camera and is difficult to insert and remove it from this case. Bu!\n",
      "good case but just a bit tight for the s9900 still fit though.\n",
      "Good case overall. Fits well. Good protection for camera though some of stitching is easily exposed. Initial quality is a little suspect but I believe it'll last.\n",
      "fits g7x mk2 tightly.  I cut it open so it slides in better.\n",
      "Great case.  I would be able to add a star if it had a pocket for an extra battery.\n",
      "I love this case. I have a new point and shoot camera. I got this case so I can carry the camera in my purse or in my camera bag with other things. Helps to keep it from getting scratched. Worth the money. Only paid 11.00 for it.\n",
      "perfect size for canon mark9\n",
      "But too small for my canon G5 X MII,\n",
      "It keeps my camera safe(powershot g7 mark ii) but it doesn’t hold my camera as expected. I was looking for a quick draw case, so I could grab my camera fast. The way it holds the camera I kind of have to peel it off my camera and put more effort than I wanted to taking it out. But it keeps it safe and that’s all that matters.\n",
      "Fits my Canon G7X mkII like a glove !\n",
      "Probably wouldn't provide adequate protection for a 3 ft. fall on concrete, but if it was any thicker, the camera, case package would be to large to be considered \"pocketable\".\n",
      "I have used similar neoprene cases for my last two pocket cameras, and they survived for many years and many 1000's of images.\n",
      "(FYI, the Canon G7X mkII is pocketable in this case in a cargo pocket. It's a little chunkier than pocket cameras with less glass. it weighs more too.)\n",
      "Excellent cushion and not bulky. Camera feels safe, which was my #1 goal. Fits my camera perfectly as advertised. There's a little lip to help secure the camera so it doesn't easily fall out, but personally I dislike this feature.  I want to be able to quickly pull out the camera to take a quick photo rather than have to fight with it to get the camera out of the case (which happened to me many many times during a recent vacation).  Also, I didn't feel comfortable using the included plastic clip to secure my expensive camera. I broke it off and replaced it with a carabiner.\n",
      "I really like this case. I agree with other reviewers who express concern about its ability to protect camera from a 3 foot drop. But if you want a case that will allow you to shove the G7x inside a bag or pock worry-free, it is perfect. All other cases were too bulky. It's also very compressible and so it's easy to quickly stow, leaving your hands free to shoot. I also like that I can keep the camera strap around my wrist while still having the case on the camera. That way you have the camera at the ready rather than trying to fish it out of a bag or disentangle it from a pocket. Can't comment on strength of belt loop as I don't carry it that way. My only real complaint is that it is VERY easy to deploy the lens accidentally while trying to squeeze the camera in. Unintentionally pushing  the side-mounted wifi button powers the camera \"on\" with the lens closed.  But once powered-up any shutter pressure (inevitable with this snug fitting case) will cause the lens to deploy.  Careful attention to where you press the camera will help, but I still have this problem. I'm thinking of trying the horizontal orientation instead.\n",
      "The case fit well and seemed good... I would have given it 4 stars. BUT... After only using it a small number of times on my belt (I would guess 5-6) I heard a clunk and was surprised to find my camera on the ground. My canon g7x sustained a small scratch as the case didn't protect it. The case's belt loop had torn free of the case, rendering it useless.\n",
      "I bought this for my Olympus Tough TG-4. This camera only has one connection area for a strap on one side of the camera. I attached both sides of my camera strap to that one connection.  With the strap around my neck, the camera hangs vertically. This case fits the camera perfectly with my camera strap. When the camera is in use, I like the extra strap with a clip to attach to my camera strap so I won't lose the case while taking photos.\n",
      "Really hard to get the camera in this case.  It's like spandex when you shouln't be wearing spandex!\n",
      "Perfect. Exactly what I was looking for.  I purchased to protect my camera while sightseeing in Spain for a month. It Was great. Protected my camera while remaining sleek enough to keep in my purse while traveling around. Recommend.\n",
      "Ordered this case my Canon G7XMKII. Arrived quickly and fit the camera great! It was slightly snug but once I get used to using it, it was a snap to pull my camera out of it with ease. I loved having the ability to attach it to my belt. It’s more or less why I ordered it. I carry my camera on me a lot...like a lot a lot.\n",
      "\n",
      "I used it for approximately one week which included some light hiking and a flight across the United States. Still completely pleased with it. However, once I arrived in one of my destinations I took the camera and case off my belt one evening and found that the stitching that held the belt loop nylon on was beginning to tear. :( I didn’t feel confident in it after (didn’t want my camera to come flying off my belt once the stitching completely failed) seeing that and was forced to spend more money on a generic commercial case somewhere which was big, bulky and in my opinion not as cool as this one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary:\n",
      "It was relatively cheap and a good deal at first. Being small, compact and flexible it was the perfect case for what I needed it for. I REALLY REALLY wanted to like this case and use it A LOT but unfortunately the stitching just kind of looked like a weak point in the product. Not really an issue of quality but more of design. If they somehow remedied this issue I would most definetly get another one which I would attach to my belt indefinetly.\n",
      "4 out of 5 stars because I just liked it so much. FIX IT PLEASEEEE :)\n",
      "I traveled through Italy and Barcelona... very good size for my camera\n",
      "I got this for my Canon G7x Mk2.  When it first arrived I was convinced that the camera would never fit inside it!  But its really stretchy and the camera along with a lens cap fits in perfectly, but tightly.  The belt loop and very secure and properly stitched and that combined with the tight fit means that you will not be able to get to the camera fast if its on your belt, so plan ahead.  Nonetheless, its a great sleek case, albeit with less protection.  And it squeezes down into a tiny size for storage.  The only thing I dont really like is the plastic clip, may have to break it off.\n",

      "I also got the large amazon basics case for more protection, ie when tossing the camera into a backpack etc.\n",
      "I recently purchased a new Canon PowerShot G7 X to replace an older Canon for use when traveling. On a trip, I take a lot of pictures – both of scenery and of food – and I want a camera (and camera case) to be to small enough to wear comfortably (and unobtrusively) around my neck all the time. I was pleased with the size of the G7 X, but found it somewhat difficult to choose a case that I liked for the camera. After spending many hours reading reviews, I decided to order 6 different camera cases to see which suited me best. Note that ALL the cases I ordered claimed to be compatible with the G7 X. Surprisingly, the MegaGear “Ultra Lite” Neoprene camera case was the only one of the six cases to suit my needs – all the other ones were either way too large/bulky OR too small for the camera (I felt like the lens was in danger of being crushed when these cases were closed).\n",
      "PROS for the MegaGear “Ultra Lite” Neoprene case: 1. the G7 X fit perfectly – secure, but not constrictively snug; 2. the case itself was actually smaller than any of the other cases that I ordered – all the other cases were larger (L x W), but some had a shallower or less forgiving depth; 3. the case was easy to open quickly to allow for fast shots of unexpected photo opportunities; 4. the supplied carabiner secured the case easily to my own neck lanyard (I like a longer lanyard length; 5. the case is lightweight and is a stylish and unobtrusive basic black (but, for those more daring than I, it also comes in hot pink, blue, gray and red).\n",
      "CONS for the MegaGear “Ultra Lite” Neoprene camera case: none really, once you get used to the Velcro closure. I had originally looked for a case with a top zipper opening, but found the MegaGear’s top flap Vecro closure worked well and was really no more “noisy” than a zipper.\n",
      "* I am pleased with my purchase and would recommend this case to other Canon PowerShot G7 X owners.\n",
      "I don't have any other M to m4/3 adapters to compare this to. There may be sample to sample variations, but mine mounts easily on my GF1 and my M mount lenses mount easily and securely into the adaptor. I think the only reason I didn't give it full 5 starts was the metal that mounts into the GF1 is (I'm guessing here) aluminum, and brass would be better; and the button that acts as the lens release isn't the same stepped design as the CV adapters, which look (and may function) a bit nicer.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will also have to add the blurb about how much fun I'm having using Leitz (and Voigtlander) glass on the GF1, and how totally spectacular the results are!\n",
      "This adapter does the job with a minimum of hassle. Rather than trying to mount and dismount Leica lenses from the adapter, it seems more sensible to just buy one of these inexpensive Leica to M43 adapters for each lens. Then, you'll not have any mount/dismount difficulty,\n",
      "\n",
      "As to infinity focus and looseness, it's easy to get a small screwdriver and some blue Lock-tite, seat the adapter correctly for infinity focus, and then use the Lock-tite to ensure that the small set screws don't come loose. As I mentioned, at these low prices, you can buy an adapter for each lens and easily ensure that it remains tightly at infinity focus.\n",
      "I would rate this product at 3.5 stars so it was hard for me to decide 3 or 4.  However, I decided on 3 because even at half the price (which is where I think it should be priced), I would give it 4 stars.  So 3 it is.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me start by saying that it works.  Also, the quality is not as bad as I thought after reading some other reviews.  Until I received it, I was thinking I would not even attach it to the camera.  However, it was better than I expected so I pressed ahead.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is an all metal part so that is a start.  However, the part that attaches to the camera is not stainless steel like the Voigtlander and\n",
      "Reasonably priced and works well.\n",

      "Accurately described item was safely and promptly shipped.\n",

      "VERY LOOSE FIT ON CAMERS\n",
      "I am not sure if I got a bad adapter or not, I got this for my Blackmagic pocket camera, and it rattles badly. If I didn't have an off camera mic, this thing would be completely useless.\n",
      "Works as expected. Allows infinity focus. Check your camera before buying as one of mine does not auto expose using stop metering. It works fine on my Panasonic GX1.\n",
      "Although the quality isn't up to the original Leica or Olympus the adaptor works great with my old M-seres lenses.\n",
      "I was very happily surprised by the quality of this adapter.  It is well machined, fits perfectly to my various Leica M lenses and allows me to critically focus my Noctilux on my Oly EPL-1.  Get this adapter. It is great quality for a great price.\n",
      "works. Had issue once removing lens due to loose pin.\n",
      "Purchased this for my Leica 50mm Summicron f 2.0.  It's easy to mount and un-mount.  The only negative thing with it is the fit.  It does not fit tightly.\n",
      "The adapter works, the quality is well below my expectation, with the Leica lenses it works fine, doesn't work with my Konica Hexanon 28mm (too tight, i'm afraid i would damage the lens).\n",
      "Focusing is easy as on my M8.\n",
      "Its cheap and working, but it feel a bit flimsy in my ZM lens, but is good enough for me.\n",
      "If you have Leica M lenses and an M43 camera, this adapter is one of the best values for the money. It is fairly-well finished, fits well and works well. No need to spend much more for a fancier name than Fotodiox!\n",
      "A little play on the lens side, but I can't tell that it hurts anything.\n",
      "Not heeding the warnings I read in other reviews and jaded by the low price - I purchased one of these adapters.  Unfortunately there is a .5mm gap present on the M mount side of my adapter which allows the lens to jostle back and forth visibly within the adapter.  I'll be returning this one and looking for a higher-quality adapter.  The price was to good to be true.\n",
      "I purchased this item to use my Leica M lenses on a Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera. The adapter fits the BMPCC fine but the fit of the Leica lenses is totally unacceptable. The Leica lens is so loose fitting that it moves around so much that you can see the image shift on the screen just from touching the lens. I contacted Fotodiox and they did respond but their support was less than satisfactory. They responded that it is normal to have some play to the fit of the lens. No Fn way! I'm sorry. I will never purchase anything from this vendor again.\n",
      "The adapter worked fine till I tried to remove it from the camera and then the tiny release button broke off and I had to release it with a pair of sharp pointed scissors.\n",
      "The product is OK if you want to leave it fixed permanently but useless if you need to change it often.\n",
      "I read other reports on the net of people with the same problem.\n",
      "I've had adapters from this brand before, but I am very disappointed by this Leica M version.  I got this specifically for my new 50 f/1.4 and there is a small(probably 1mm) gap where it's loose.  Although, it doesn't effect the performance I am kind of afraid it might wear on the Leica brass from constant movement.  If I can find a better replacement I might return this item.\n",

      "Also purchased: BestDealUSA Lens Mount Leica M lens to Micro 4/3 m4/3 Adapter which works but is not as nicely machined.\n",
      "I've been trying to decide on what a fair price would be for a quality adapter... something I could feel comfortable using with a Leica lens, unfortunately, at $80 this adapter is disappointing. First it's not exactly what I see in the picture. I must have received an earlier version because the locking button is different; the red paint that was on it I immediately scratched off because I was afraid it would rub off on it's own and end up inside the camera or the lens. Probably why they changed it to what's in the picture. Good luck getting a newer one. Second, there's no marker to line up the lens with when attaching it. I had to look at the tabs on the lens' mount and the recessions in the adapter to line things up. Lame. Third, the lens fits a little too snug. The way they manufactured it to create grip on the lens is cheap and looks like it could damage a lens if one isn't careful or if the adapter wasn't tested properly. Bottom line, this adapter seems to be of the same build quality as the cheaper adapters on ebay. It looks like I'll be paying $250 for the Panasonic DMW-MA2M adapter. It appears to have the same mount at my M7. My bad for trying out a less expensive solution.\n",
      "The build quality is \"OK\" for the price.  The adapter to camera mount is fine.  The M lens to adapter interface is a little stiff, may loosen up with use but so what.  It works and lets me use my M mount lenses on my Olympus e-pl1.  What a joy!  Aperture priority gives you auto exposure.  Full manual control with fill flash exposure compensation is also easy.  I use the 40mm F2 (80mm equivalent in 35mm format)for portraits, indoor low light photograpy.  This lens with iso 3200 on the e-pl1 for theater/church avialable light photograpy is fantastic.  Used my 90mm F4 (180mm 35mm equivalent) with a monopod for a track meet and photographing a bicycle pace line (hand held).  The in body IS stablizes these lenses! Imagine shooting a 180mm hand held on a moving target at 1/250th!  Focusing on the screen works fine.  For precision focusing, one touch on the zoom button brings up the focus magnification screen (7x to 14x, your choise)another push toggles back to compositin view.  In bright light an external viewfinder is avialable.\n",

      "Have been using this adapeter for eight months now.  The \"M\" side did loosen up and now is almost as smooth as the u 4/3 side.  The plating on the release button is wearing off and shows some brass but so what, we take it on and off a lot and switch between two M lenses regularly.  At this price buy one for each of your M lenses and get proper rear u 4/3 caps for each adapter.  The supplied ones fall off easily.\n",

The Leica M adapter is much thinner than SLR adapters because back of M mount lenses is closer to the focal plane, and hence it requires a bit more dexterity to install.

I just need to add velcro to the outside sides as it is in the wrong place to line up with the bag's velcro, and a small piece of padding to the bottom and it will be perfect.\n",
      "Keeps your lenses from being damaged in your bag.  Great find\n",

      "YES, I WOULD recommend any DOMKE item to a friend or family member.\n",
      "I bought one of these with the idea that I could put a Nikon 70-300 ED-AF w/hood in one compartment and stack a 28/2.8 AF and a 50/1.4 AF (both with hoods) in the other, like I can with the 4 compartment insert, but I was mistaken.  The 2 compartment insert is substantually smaller than half of the 4 pocket, so the 70-300 fits fine and seems to be well-padded, but the other compartment is more suited for a flash than another lens or two.  As with every Domke product I've owned (quite a few since the Original in 1976), the quality of construction is excellent and it does serve a purpose--just not the way I'd intended.\n",
      "I bought this because I didnt want to lug around an expensive camera bag.\n",
      "I like the inserts. They fit well  with my bookbag/messenger bag, and you cant tell I have a nice camera inside.\n",
      "I think it works well for my needs, and I have the other domke insert as well.\n",
      "one holds my camera & kit lens, and the other insert holds my telephoto and soon to be UWA lens.\n",
      "I agree that bottom portion of the insert needs the most padding, but its fine. I just went to Home Depot and bought some closed cell padding/insulation. works fine.\n",
      "This is just poorly made, they didn't even bother to stich up the bottom so the foam padding is secure.  It's really too small for a D-600 and lens.  It would work for a couple of lenses without a body.  But I could not recommend it because of the poor quality.\n",
      "I purchased this insert with the thought of putting it in the bottom of my backpack to hold my Canon SLR body and a medium sized zoom lens.  Impossible to do!  This insert is really small, and I would recommend something else if you have an SLR.\n",
      "I have found genuine Domke products (there are a number of fakes out there) to be the perfect combination of security and minimalism.  In the case of Domke inserts, they are more moldable than the competing inserts and compliment Domke bags perfectly as they keep the bag from becoming too rigid.\n",
      "\n",
      "When first transitioning from excessively padded compartments to Domke, you will be concerned about your gear being properly protected.  Trust me, after extended use and abuse, these inserts will not let you down unless you need to protect your equipment from 20 foot falls onto concrete.  Using these inserts, especially in Domke bags, provides great flexibility and usability without bulk and weight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many people are turned off upon receipt citing build quality because the foam appears to come out of the inserts.  The build quality is fine.  They are actually designed this way for flexibility.  They will not come apart (unless they are not genuine Domke).\n",
      "I bought this insert to convert a large compartment in a Swiss Gear backpack to safety and securely store three lenses a Nikon 35mm F1.8, Nikon 18-55vr and Sigma 70-300mm APO DG lens.  The compartment is constructed of high quality material but something was oddly missing.  There is no foam on the bottom of the insert.  Now I've been using some foam inserts from an Ape Case on the bottom of this backpack to prevent damage during an accidental mishandling and I was expecting this insert to be padded on the bottom.\n",
      "\n",
      "The insert is not hard sided but soft and flexible and the divider is attached with velcro so if you wanted you could completely remove it.  The sides are padded but a four star rating seems justified for such an oversight of padding on the bottom.  I'm still recommending this insert because its potential uses are endless and it is perfectly constructed.\n",
      "This product is perfect for what it is designed for, which is fitting inside certain Domke bags. It is great for that purpose. I got it as a replacement to use inside my Domke F-4AF bag. That bag came with a similar insert, which is currently being used elsewhere. This new insert is much nicer than the original one. The original insert had a sewn-in divider in the middle. The new one has a movable divider so you can have one big compartment or create custom sized dual compartments.\n",
      "\n",
      "A reviewer complained that the bottom edge of the sides are not stitched up and the foam protection is not secure. It is designed this way, so that you can remove unnecessary padding and create more room in the bag. So, for example, if this insert is placed next to another insert which already has padding in it, you can remove the foam in one of the inserts and have more space. The foam will be secure if it is used in the appropriate sized Domke bag. Another reviewer complains that there is no padding on the bottom. Again, this insert is designed to fit in Domke bags that already have padding in the bottom. Another layer of foam is unnecessary and wastes space.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you are looking for a divider to use in a backpack or some other bag besides the appropriate Domke bag, you should probably look elsewhere. There are plenty of companies, such as F-stop, that make inserts that are much better suited for that purpose.\n",

"I bought this Compaq A1500 this week and am more than satisfied with it. Simple installation without any problems, excellent photo quality resolution even on plain paper, very good managing software and the best part is, I didn't need any customer support to make it run :). Very good product with excellent features, quality and resolution. Believe me it's better than the best available in this price range.",['For the price'],10,Positive,0.9974933333333332
"I bought the A1500 based on the Compaq name and the excellent results I`ve had with their other products, however I started having problems immediatly, it just would not work. When I called Tech support, I was informed that it was not campatible with my operating system. When I pointed out I was using Win 98se on a Compaq comupter they tried to help. I was able to finally get it installed after being on the phone with Tech Support for almost 2 hours. It worked for one day then quit printing. When I again called Tech Support and spent another hour on the phone the printer finally started working but the Scanner quit. As I was buying a second computer with Win XP I asked if it would be compatible and was assured that it was. When I was ready to install the A1500 on the new computer, I called Tech Support and they taslked me through the whole process. Not only would it not install it crashed my system and I had to do a full restore. As I waited to long to return it, it is now seating on a shelf collecting dust until I can find someone who will take it off my hands. In the mean time I`m still looking for a good multifunction that will work as advertised. I would not recommend the A1500 to anyone who does not have money and time to waste.","['Compaq A1500', 'excellent print', 'lesser mean time', 'multifunctioning']",8,Positive,0.998390909090909
"I bought this machine without realizing that it is not compatable with the original Windows 98. It worked fine for a couple weeks, but will no longer print properly. I have tried to correct this problem to no avail, I've even sent it back to Compaq!! On my third call to tech support, I was told that on one of the pages inside the manual it states that this is a 'Known issue' and that I must have 'Windows 98 Second Edition' for their product to work. This vital information should be prominatly noted in the advertising. I am very dissappointed!'","['Windows 98', 'Windows 98 Second Edition']",6,Negative,0.8661555555555556
"A powerful, well constructed notebook that provides some useful new features.  So far it has performed well and runs my most demanding applications with no problems.  I particularly like the compactness of the 14.1 inch display and the keyboard has an excellent feel to it.  Things I don't like are the poor speaker sound quality and positioning, the highly reflective display, the Vista user interface, and the lack of a true display mechanical latch.  It would have been nice to have had a CF memory card reader.  This product comes from Amazon with a free upgrade to Windows 7, a nice carry case and a useable optical mouse.","['14.1 inch display', 'Windows 7', 'carry case', 'optical mouse', 'reflective display', 'vista user interface', 'no CF memory card reader']",4,Positive,1.0
"I usually buy the high end little sonys and am usually not that price sensitive.  This laptop is fantastic and I leave the sonys at home now.  Beautiful LCD screen, fantastic solid keyboard (backlit which is a feature I will never give up after this) and good size and weight for the screen size.  Also excellent battery life.  I usually go through two laptops a year, but I cant think of any of the latest gear out there that would tempt me right now and Ive researched them all at all prices.  The price is low on this ASUS, which almost scared me away for concerns about quality, but no concern there at all.  Very solid fast machine.","['sony laptops', 'asus', 'good battery life']",3,Negative,0.9349625000000001

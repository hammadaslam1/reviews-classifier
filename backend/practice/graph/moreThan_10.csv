"I bought this Compaq A1500 this week and am more than satisfied with it. Simple installation without any problems, excellent photo quality resolution even on plain paper, very good managing software and the best part is, I didn't need any customer support to make it run :). Very good product with excellent features, quality and resolution. Believe me it's better than the best available in this price range.",['For the price'],10,Positive,0.9974933333333332

"I bought this Compaq A1500 this week and am more than satisfied with it. Simple installation without any problems, excellent photo quality resolution even on plain paper, very good managing software and the best part is, I didn't need any customer support to make it run :). Very good product with excellent features, quality and resolution. Believe me it's better than the best available in this price range.",['For the price'],10,Positive,0.9974933333333332
"I bought the A1500 based on the Compaq name and the excellent results I`ve had with their other products, however I started having problems immediatly, it just would not work. When I called Tech support, I was informed that it was not campatible with my operating system. When I pointed out I was using Win 98se on a Compaq comupter they tried to help. I was able to finally get it installed after being on the phone with Tech Support for almost 2 hours. It worked for one day then quit printing. When I again called Tech Support and spent another hour on the phone the printer finally started working but the Scanner quit. As I was buying a second computer with Win XP I asked if it would be compatible and was assured that it was. When I was ready to install the A1500 on the new computer, I called Tech Support and they taslked me through the whole process. Not only would it not install it crashed my system and I had to do a full restore. As I waited to long to return it, it is now seating on a shelf collecting dust until I can find someone who will take it off my hands. In the mean time I`m still looking for a good multifunction that will work as advertised. I would not recommend the A1500 to anyone who does not have money and time to waste.","['Compaq A1500', 'excellent print', 'lesser mean time', 'multifunctioning']",8,Positive,0.998390909090909
"I bought this machine without realizing that it is not compatable with the original Windows 98. It worked fine for a couple weeks, but will no longer print properly. I have tried to correct this problem to no avail, I've even sent it back to Compaq!! On my third call to tech support, I was told that on one of the pages inside the manual it states that this is a 'Known issue' and that I must have 'Windows 98 Second Edition' for their product to work. This vital information should be prominatly noted in the advertising. I am very dissappointed!'","['Windows 98', 'Windows 98 Second Edition']",6,Negative,0.8661555555555556
"Purchased the ASUS F80Q-X2AM 14.1 inch laptop and have found it to be one sweet and powerful laptop.  Fast, reliable and easy connectivity.  Leaves my desktop in the smoke.  Great product at a great price ($614.70).","['ASUS F80Q-X2AM', 'powerful', 'great product']",2,Positive,1.0
"A powerful, well constructed notebook that provides some useful new features.  So far it has performed well and runs my most demanding applications with no problems.  I particularly like the compactness of the 14.1 inch display and the keyboard has an excellent feel to it.  Things I don't like are the poor speaker sound quality and positioning, the highly reflective display, the Vista user interface, and the lack of a true display mechanical latch.  It would have been nice to have had a CF memory card reader.  This product comes from Amazon with a free upgrade to Windows 7, a nice carry case and a useable optical mouse.","['14.1 inch display', 'Windows 7', 'carry case', 'optical mouse', 'reflective display', 'vista user interface', 'no CF memory card reader']",4,Positive,1.0
"I usually buy the high end little sonys and am usually not that price sensitive.  This laptop is fantastic and I leave the sonys at home now.  Beautiful LCD screen, fantastic solid keyboard (backlit which is a feature I will never give up after this) and good size and weight for the screen size.  Also excellent battery life.  I usually go through two laptops a year, but I cant think of any of the latest gear out there that would tempt me right now and Ive researched them all at all prices.  The price is low on this ASUS, which almost scared me away for concerns about quality, but no concern there at all.  Very solid fast machine.","['sony laptops', 'asus', 'good battery life']",3,Negative,0.9349625000000001
"Why did I buy it: wanted a 13-14inch with good power, so found this with slightly positive reviews , warranty/insurance, very powerful, 14inch, good ventilation. Didn't get Dell studio 14z (price, too much heat, no dvd), sony vaio CW (price), HP DV4t (price if configured the same), DELL StudioXPS 13 (price, heat issues, battery duration,small touchpad) have had it for 5 days so far ... Got it for [850$ from amazon] (could have gotten it for [...] if I used bing cashback and [...] ) Pros: -Very powerful.. CPU , GPU , HDD (7200rpm).. it got 5.9 on windows experience index because of the HDD, the CPU/RAM gets 6.4 & GPU gets 6.6 .that's with win 7 64bit, it got as far as I remember ; 5.4 or 5.9 on the CPU with vista 32bit that came with it.. -Sooo cheap for such power -Looks nice; not super nice, but nice.. -Very well ventilation design .. for all that power, it doesn't get hot. -included mouse (not wireless) and bag... -full array of ports ( including FIVE usb ports, that is amazing ) Cons: when you have so much power, the input devices should be up to the same standard; they are not -No backlit keyboard.. I know; I knew this before buying it; but when you get it and can't see the f1/f12 keys in the dark and can't see the WIFI / Bluetooth either ; not even the power button if it is not turned on ... -FN key on left of CTRL key ... VERY VERY Stupid .. I already knew, but thought I can adapt; not yet.. -Horrible sounding and functioning touchpad buttons .. needs too much power to press and makes too much noise .. I already knew thru reviews but didn't appreciate how bad they are .. I honestly try to avoid using them .. -Now the worst part; the left side of the keyboard is so flimsy that when pressing any of those keys (ESC,`,1,2,TAB,Q,W,A,S,CAPS,LT SHIFT, Z,LT CTRL,FN) it makes so much noise ... you won't appreciate how frustrating or annoying this is until you use it ... Same about trying to avoid using them, except u can't -The DVD tray button is very difficult to press without directly looking at it ... - the scrolling bar on the touchpad is a hit/miss, you have to press the line drawn on the touchpad exactly for it to work , and it keeps scrolling even after u remove your finger, u have to press it again like u r applying a brake .. STUPID DESIGN .. - unresponsive keys: sometimes some keys don't respond to pressing them leading to too many typing errors .. - poooor battery life, though it is understandable, but at least ASUS should offer a 9 cell option ... update 12/29/09: - f3,f4,f9 keys don't have labels for their other function ( default mail application, default browser, turn on/off touchpad in order)","['ASUS laptop', '5 usb ports', 'full array of ports', 'HDMI ports']",2,Negative,0.7236

"I bought this Compaq A1500 this week and am more than satisfied with it. Simple installation without any problems, excellent photo quality resolution even on plain paper, very good managing software and the best part is, I didn't need any customer support to make it run :).
Very good product with excellent features, quality and resolution. Believe me it's better than the best available in this price range.","['compaq week', 'simple installation problem', 'excellent photo quality resolution', 'plain paper good', 'software good need customer support run good product', 'quality resolution', 'available price range']"
"I bought the A1500 based on the Compaq name and the excellent results I`ve had with their other products, however I started having problems immediatly, it just would not work. When I called Tech support, I was informed that it was not campatible with my operating system. When I pointed out I was using Win 98se on a Compaq comupter they tried to help. I was able to finally get it installed after being on the phone with Tech Support for almost 2 hours. It worked for one day then quit printing. When I again called Tech Support and spent another hour on the phone the printer finally started working but the Scanner quit. As I was buying a second computer with Win XP I asked if it would be compatible and was assured that it was.
When I was ready to install the A1500 on the new computer, I called Tech Support and they taslked me through the whole process. Not only would it not install it crashed my system and I had to do a full restore.
As I waited to long to return it, it is now seating on a shelf collecting dust until I can find someone who will take it off my hands. In the mean time I`m still looking for a good multifunction that will work as advertised.
I would not recommend the A1500 to anyone who does not have money and time to waste.","['base compaq', 'excellent result ve product', 'tech support', 'system point', 'se compaq comupter', 'instal phone tech support hour work day', 'tech support', 'hour phone printer', 'work scanner', 'ready install', 'new computer', 'tech support taslke process install crash system restore', 'return seat shelf', 'time look good multifunction work advertise', 'money time waste']"
"I picked this old Compaq A1500 up at a yard sale. It was so filthy and plugged with old ink I figured it was shot. But after disassembling it and cleaning the innards good, it went to working after I installed two new cartridges. I use Windows XP and havent had any problems with this printer, unlike my old Lexmark X83. I wont even go there. Overall a decent printer.","['old compaq yard sale filthy plug', 'old ink figure shoot disassemble', 'clean innard good', 'work instal', 'new cartridge use windows xp', 'problem printer', 'old lexmark', 'decent printer']"
"The A1500 was the first multifunctional I've used.  I purchase one in 2001 for about $100. Overall, it was a decent machine before it began to die.

It takes two ink cartridges, Lexmark black-12A1970 ($25-$32) and Lexmark color-12A1985 ($29-$39).  The ink seemed to last for a good while.  However, if you don't use the cartridges in a while, the ink will dry up (this is what happened to my color cartridge a few times).

When I first purchased it, I thought the design was great, but as I needed copies and scans of different items, I changed my mind.  The copier/scanner is operated via a feeder instead of being a flatbed.  I couldn't scan a page from a book or magazine (unless I wanted to rip out the page and feed it to the machine).  It was also somewhat difficult to make copies of smaller items such as cards, IDs or pictures, even with the protective sleeve that is included with this model.

Before Compaq was bought out by HP, there was Compaq Customer Communities where consumers could post questions and give answers to one another (I had an alignment problem with this unit that was easily solved by a visit to Customer Communities).  Unfortunately, HP removed the community.  I guess it's a good thing I got the 3 year warranty from Circuit City.  After about a year and a half, the scanner and copier started to act up.  I would no longer get clean scans/copies, and it would use two 8.5"" x 11"""" pages to copy a single document with the same dimensions.  Customer Service couldn't help with the problem","['multifunctional purchase overall', 'decent machine', 'ink cartridge lexmark', 'black lexmark color ink good use cartridge ink dry', 'color cartridge time purchase', 'great need copy scan', 'different item', 'mind copi scanner', 'scan page book magazine', 'rip page feed machine', 'difficult copy', 'small item card id picture', 'protective sleeve', 'model compaq', 'hp compaq customer communities consumer post question', 'alignment problem unit', 'visit customer communities', 'community guess', 'good thing', 'year warranty circuit city year', 'scanner copi', 'long clean scan copy use page copy single document dimension customer service']"
"I bought this machine without realizing that it is not compatable with the original Windows 98. It worked fine for a couple weeks, but will no longer print properly. I have tried to correct this problem to no avail, I've even sent it back to Compaq!! On my third call to tech support, I was told that on one of the pages inside the manual it states that this is a ""Known issue"""" and that I must have """"Windows 98 Second Edition"""" for their product to work. This vital information should be prominatly noted in the advertising.

"We've only had the computer for a week or so, but I've been very impressed.  The case really does feel wonderful, and the screen is quite bright (and the weight is terrific for traveling!).

"Purchased the ASUS F80Q-X2AM 14.1 inch laptop and have found it to be one sweet and powerful laptop.  Fast, reliable and easy connectivity.  Leaves my desktop in the smoke.

"A powerful, well constructed notebook that provides some useful new features.  So far it has performed well and runs my most demanding applications with no problems.  I particularly like the compactness of the 14.1 inch display and the keyboard has an excellent feel to it.  Things I don't like are the poor speaker sound quality and positioning, the highly reflective display, the Vista user interface, and the lack of a true display mechanical latch.  It would have been nice to have had a CF memory card reader.  This product comes from Amazon with a free upgrade to Windows 7, a nice carry case and a useable optical mouse.","['powerful construct notebook', 'application problem', 'compactness inch display keyboard', 'poor speaker', 'sound quality', 'reflective display vista user interface lack', 'true display', 'mechanical latch', 'nice cf memory card reader product', 'free upgrade windows', 'useable optical mouse']"
"After having been impressed with the ASUS EeePC 901 for the last year, I decided to buy a bigger ASUS laptop as a gift for one of my kids. I ended up getting the F80Q-X2AM because it's bigger than a netbook but it's not really big. The 14.1 inch screen and full sized keyboard are just what I was looking for. This laptop has everything you could want: DVD player, webcam, big hard drive, lots of RAM, memory card reader, wireless network card, bluetooth, decent carrying case.  Good stuff. On top of that, the 2-year warranty, accidental damage protection, and spill-proof keyboard are really nice, especially for a laptop going to a young kid.

The only thing I don't like about this laptop is the operating system. Windows Vista is for the birds, and I'm not just saying that. I've had bad experiences with Vista in the past, so I'm biased negatively with respect to Vista. On the other hand, I used to work at Microsoft and I like the company a lot. But when it takes 3 hours to get connected to a wireless network, you know you're using a crummy operating sytem. Specifically, I encountered the infamous ""unidentified network"""" problem which millions of others have likely experienced over the last couple of years with Vista. Although there's seemingly no sure fire way to fix the problem","['impress asus eeepc year', 'big asus laptop gift kid end', 'big netbook', 'big inch screen', 'keyboard look laptop', 'dvd player webcam', 'big hard drive lot ram memory card reader wireless network card bluetooth', 'case good stuff year warranty accidental damage protection spill proof keyboard', 'young kid thing', 'system windows vista bird', 'bad experience vista past bias', 'respect vista hand work microsoft', 'company lot', 'wireless network', 'encounter infamous', 'network problem', 'likely experience couple year vista', 'sure fire way fix problem']"
"Unfortunately this laptop has blue-screened more times than I care to list in the time that I've had it.  To be fair, I suspect that this is probably more of a software issue courtesy of our wonderful friends at Microsoft (can you say ""Vista""""?)","['blue screen time care list time fair', 'software issue courtesy', 'wonderful friend microsoft vista']"
"I usually buy the high end little sonys and am usually not that price sensitive.  This laptop is fantastic and I leave the sonys at home now.  Beautiful LCD screen, fantastic solid keyboard (backlit which is a feature I will never give up after this) and good size and weight for the screen size.  Also excellent battery life.  I usually go through two laptops a year, but I cant think of any of the latest gear out there that would tempt me right now and Ive researched them all at all prices.  The price is low on this ASUS, which almost scared me away for concerns about quality, but no concern there at all.

I have had this notebook for just about 4 years. The first year was spent RMAing it. Then finally I had a working laptop. The battery life was 3hrs on power saver doing things such web browsing and typing. Then one year ago the hard drive failed. So I replaced it. Now after 4 years of cleaning dust and replacing thermal paste it still works.,"['notebook year year', 'laptop battery life hrs power saver thing web browse', 'hard drive', 'clean dust', 'thermal paste work']"
"REVISION:  I've now had this computer for 5 months and I'd like to revise my earlier review.  The notebook was fantastic until the power supply issues began.  I've RMA'd the product back to Asus.  However, they've had it for more than 3 weeks and are still waiting for parts.  I can't imagine why they don't have parts on hand for a computer this recently manufactured.  When I looked for a way to contact the company about my frustration at how long it's taking to get my computer returned, I realize that no addresses or ""contact us"""" types of information is supplied on their unbelievably BAD website.

"Quick review: Was and still is one of the best computers I've ever used. When I first purchased it, I didn't know who Asus was. Asus is now the only computer/technology products I purchase.

Purchased the notebook in August 2009 to replace the brand-new hunk of HP junk that's broke a week after I bought it but HP refused to repair it b/c it got wet in shipping and I didn't buy insurance. No need to worry, I jury-rigged it and sold it at a $50.00 profit to a poor consumer that hasn't yet learned to either look online for product reviews or understand that the only good HP product is the one you don't own. I know, another story for another time....

Anyway, I'm trying to be a better consumer and that means being a better product reviewer. I'm not going to go to a lot of effort or detail here but I do want to ""catch-up"""" my product reviews. So","['quick review good computer purchase', 'asus asus computer technology product purchase purchase notebook', 'new hunk hp junk', 'hp refuse repair', 'wet shipping', 'insurance need', 'poor consumer', 'online product review', 'good hp product', 'story time', 'product reviewer', 'lot effort detail', 'catch product review']"
"I bought this notebook based on it's great specifications. It would certainly be a good notebook if it was dependable. It is not. I have never had so much trouble with a computer. The operating system constantly gets corrupted. The computer freezes frequently resulting in a hard restarts which further corrupts the system. Sent it in to be looked at by Asus after informing them that I had reinstalled the operating system 5 times and thought either the motherboard or memory was bad. Also told them one of the USB ports was defective. All they did was reinstall the operating system. I had already done that 5 times in a matter of 3 weeks. They did not even test the hardware.

The display is not very good. Very bad viewing angles. Blacks are not black, but grey. Buttons are hard to click. Fingerprint device does not load when booting. The video card is very good, too bad the rest of the system is not well designed and components faulty. I may have to get with my credit card company on this one as Asus doesn't seem very interested in repairing it and I am ready to throw it in the garbage. Sony and Macintosh products are much superior, but don't offer such a great video card.

Overall, I would not recommend this notebook to anyone, unless you enjoy frustration. I have owned over 10 notebooks over the last 15 years or so, and this is the worst of the bunch. Stay away, look at Sony, Dell or Apple instead.

Added March 2010: Bought a Sony Vaio CW. Great computer. Now I can ditch this Asus N81 crap. No system corruption no matter what I install. This is how a computer should run. There has got to be an incompatibility with Windows and Asus software. Lesson learned: buy Apple or Sony.","['notebook base', 'great specification', 'good notebook', 'dependable trouble computer', 'corrupt computer', 'hard restart', 'corrupt system', 'system time', 'motherboard memory', 'usb port', 'defective reinstall', 'system time matter week test hardware display good', 'bad view angle', 'black black grey button', 'hard click fingerprint device load boot video card good', 'bad rest system design component faulty credit card company asus', 'garbage sony macintosh product', 'great video card overall', 'own notebook year', 'bad bunch stay', 'sony dell apple', 'sony vaio cw', 'great computer ditch asus crap system corruption matter install computer run', 'incompatibility windows asus software lesson', 'apple sony']"

It comes with a bundle, even though the accesories ain't that great, they are still some nice freebies (Carrying Bag and Optical Mouse). Asus warranty seems to be great, we will see in the future if/when I need it. HDMI is nice, even though after upgrading to Windows 7 Ultimate I had some problems to make it show properly on my HDTV (32 Inch Samsung Full HD). Overall, a 9/10 for this kind of product.

"Why did I buy it: wanted a 13-14inch with good power, so found this with slightly positive reviews , warranty/insurance, very powerful, 14inch, good ventilation. Didn't get Dell studio 14z (price, too much heat, no dvd), sony vaio CW (price), HP DV4t (price if configured the same), DELL StudioXPS 13 (price, heat issues, battery duration,small touchpad)
have had it for 5 days so far ... Got it for [850$ from amazon] (could have gotten it for [...] if I used bing cashback and [...] )
Pros:
-Very powerful.. CPU , GPU , HDD (7200rpm).. it got 5.9 on windows experience index because of the HDD, the CPU/RAM gets 6.4 & GPU gets 6.6 .that's with win 7 64bit, it got as far as I remember ; 5.4 or 5.9 on the CPU with vista 32bit that came with it..
-Sooo cheap for such power
-Looks nice; not super nice, but nice..
-Very well ventilation design .. for all that power, it doesn't get hot.
-included mouse (not wireless) and bag...
-full array of ports ( including FIVE usb ports, that is amazing )
Cons:
when you have so much power, the input devices should be up to the same standard; they are not
-No backlit keyboard.. I know; I knew this before buying it; but when you get it and can't see the f1/f12 keys in the dark and can't see the WIFI / Bluetooth either ; not even the power button if it is not turned on ...

-FN key on left of CTRL key ... VERY VERY Stupid .. I already knew, but thought I can adapt; not yet..
-Horrible sounding and functioning touchpad buttons .. needs too much power to press and makes too much noise .. I already knew thru reviews but didn't appreciate how bad they are .. I honestly try to avoid using them ..
-Now the worst part; the left side of the keyboard is so flimsy that when pressing any of those keys (ESC,`,1,2,TAB,Q,W,A,S,CAPS,LT SHIFT, Z,LT CTRL,FN) it makes so much noise ... you won't appreciate how frustrating or annoying this is until you use it ... Same about trying to avoid using them, except u can't
-The DVD tray button is very difficult to press without directly looking at it ...
- the scrolling bar on the touchpad is a hit/miss, you have to press the line drawn on the touchpad exactly for it to work , and it keeps scrolling even after u remove your finger, u have to press it again like u r applying a brake .. STUPID DESIGN ..
- unresponsive keys: sometimes some keys don't respond to pressing them leading to too many typing errors ..
- poooor battery life, though it is understandable, but at least ASUS should offer a 9 cell option ...

- f3,f4,f9 keys don't have labels for their other function ( default mail application, default browser, turn on/off touchpad in order)","['inch good power', 'positive review warranty insurance', 'powerful inch good ventilation dell studio price heat dvd sony vaio cw price hp dv price configure dell studioxps price heat issue battery duration', 'small touchpad day', 'powerful cpu gpu hdd rpm', 'windows experience index hdd cpu ram', 'cpu vista bit', 'cheap power look', 'ventilation design power', 'mouse wireless bag', 'full array port', 'usb port', 'amazing con power input device', 'backlit keyboard', 'dark wifi bluetooth power button', 'fn key', 'ctrl key stupid', 'adapt horrible', 'sound function touchpad button need power press', 'keyboard flimsy press key esc tab caps lt', 'lt ctrl fn', 'dvd tray button', 'difficult press', 'press line', 'finger press', 'brake stupid design', 'unresponsive key key', 'press lead type error poooor battery life', 'understandable asus', 'cell option update key label function default', 'application default browser', 'touchpad order']"

The only comment I have is that ASUS puts a bunch of bloatware on their laptops without any explanation of what it is or what it does. However, once you figure it out most of the bloatware is cool, the useless stuff can be easily removed.

The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because of the case, just too darn much plastic for me.  Although the carbon fiber look to it is pretty cool looking!

Six months later, it's still running well with no problems and I'm continually glad I made the purchase.

I also do some casual gaming with it, thanks to the Nvidia graphics card. Games like Dragon Age push it to it's limits, but it can still handle newer games. It has no trouble with anything older than that (unless there are compatibility issues between the game and Windows 7.

I plan on using this laptop as I return to graduate school and feel like it's size, weight, and speed will work well for me to use it mainly for work, and a bit of entertainment on the side.

My chief complaints, which keep me from giving it 5 stars, are that it doesn't have separate media buttons for changing the volume (though this can be done by holding the function key and hitting F11 or F12), it's lack of various video output ports, and that the speakers distort when turned up all the way.

I bought the Asus K70IC-A1 laptop new in Dec. 09 and to this day have not received anything resembling satisfaction.  I returned it to the factory THREE times for repair of the same problem.  The cursor would select things that I didn't want to select.  That is the primary problem with other related problems also occurring.  Asus most recently sent me a refurbished laptop that I'm assuming someone else returned to the factory for the same problems.  I am now communicating with our state attorney generals office to try to get satisfaction from Asus.,"['asus ic laptop', 'new dec day', 'resemble satisfaction return factory time repair problem cursor', 'select thing', 'select primary problem', 'refurbish laptop', 'return factory problem communicate state attorney general office', 'satisfaction asus']"
"This is the first laptop I have owned in a long time. My current computer is a Dell desktop. So far the laptop is performing at top speed. I love it!
Pros: Huge screen that is not distorted. Super fast processor, awesome warranty, great features(HDMI that I connect to my bedroom tv)...
Cons: Windows 7 - if you have older software that you want to install good luck. It may or may not work.
I was able to install MS Office 2003 with Outlook. I had trouble installing Outlook 2003 but eventually got it to work. Printer had problems too but I installed the Vista update and then 7 and it worked. Same with my MP3 player.
Windows 7 started out as not my favorite windows but it is growing on me.

"For the price I think this laptop is pretty decent.  You get all the bells and whistles you could possibly want for only a hundred dollars more than the older model without a blue-ray player, not as good graphics card, less memory, etc.

My only complaint is with the touchpad, although this complaint can cause some headaches.  First off the location and style of the touch pad is pretty bad.  Because it isn't a different color from the rest of the case and the indentation is not very deep, its really easy to not truely know your on it unless you actively concentrate on where your finger is, so it's a lot less natural than other touch pads.  Secondly the location is horrible.  When I type with the keyboard i fairly often bump the touchpad with my left-hand palm, which causes the mouse to click occasionally.  If I'm in a word processor or web browser this can be extremely aggravating as I can change web pages or where I am typing if the cursor is at those areas.

Thirdly, either the software or the sensor is not the greatest.  About 10% of the time my clicks don't register or moving across the screen registers as a click.  I'm hoping once i get time to find any updated drivers for the touchpad (whose website I tried but wasn't working when I looked this weekend) will fix this, otherwise it's gonna be a long 4 years before I get a new computer.

UPDATE:  After a little over a year old, this laptop's graphics card started failing, and this caused a month+ long odyssy to get it fixed by ASUS under warrenty.  Because of this debacle, I will never by an ASUS product again. Read more below.

This experience report isn't about this exact model, but a similar one for which I have had a terrible experience with ASUS technical support, and so potential buyers of any ASUS computer should be well-aware in order to know what their experience might be. The summary is for a simple bad graphics card (under warranty), getting the computer back in working condition involved a 5-week ordeal, 6 emails to them, 5 phone calls, misleading information almost making me pay for repairs, and them wiping my hard drive in my opinion unnecessarily. All this means I will never buy an ASUS laptop again, and you shouldn't either. For the details, read on.

About 7 months ago, I started noticing a flicker of the laptop's screen about 1 time a day. I emailed ASUS tech support using their message center about it, and asked what I should do.

"I bought this so I could use a laptop when I'm away from my desktop.  It was one of the few really small, affordable laptop computers that runs Win 7 Professional, which I need for access to my employer's network.  It's no speed demon, and the hard drive is a bit smaller than I would like, but it works.  What I discovered is that the computer works well enough that I use it at home more than I expected.  If I want to browse the web or do email or do simple picture editing I can carry the ASUS into a quiet part of the house and work in peace.
The build quality is good, though this is not an industrial strength device that will take a huge beating.  I don't know if the keyboard would hold up to long hours of daily use.  This notebook PC probably won't take the place of your desktop but it works well.  Mine has been reliable so far.  The only real complaints so far:  The short/wide screen is not ideal for viewing some web pages, and the small screen yields fairly small text size on many pages.

"This laptop is snappy and solid.  Feels good to use and is a generally great laptop.  The only problem I had was one that not many people will run into: I needed to hook an extra large monitor to the external VGA port.  I did so, and it would not recognize the PNP monitor as a PNP monitor, but instead labeled it as NON-PNP Generic.  This limits the resolutions available to the monitor.  I tried several different monitors (normal sized and large, and they all had the same result.  None of them registered as plug and play.
I contacted ASUS, as this was clearly an OS or Hardware issue, both of which would fall under their abilities to fix.  They told me that the large monitor was outside what the driver supported.  This was clearly incorrect as the issue had nothing to do with the size of the monitor (as proven by using smaller monitors).  The first tech used every excuse he could think of not to work on the system including saying that the support of this laptop's hardware was not their problem.  At this point I asked that the problem be escalated or that I could talk to his manager.  He would do neither, but suggested that I call back and talk to someone else.  I did.
The next tech looked over the notes left by the other tech and said that he was not able to escalate the call either as the criteria did not match the requirements for escalations in their system.  A little more honest.  He did say, however, that if I sent the laptop back to them that they would take a look at this and get it resolved.  I needed the laptop for that weekend, but at least he finally supplied me a path to resolution.  The second tech was more pleasant, and slightly more helpful, but generally felt like he had his hands tied.
The ASUS support was not what I have come to expect from professional support from other vendors.
Their product might be great, but I would not recommend their product due their support.","['laptop snappy', 'good use', 'great laptop problem people', 'need hook', 'extra large monitor external vga port', 'pnp monitor pnp monitor', 'label non pnp generic limit resolution', 'available monitor', 'different monitor', 'large result register plug play contact asus', 'os hardware issue fall ability fix', 'large monitor', 'driver support', 'incorrect issue size monitor', 'small monitor tech excuse', 'work system', 'support laptop hardware problem point', 'problem escalate talk manager', 'tech look note', 'able escalate criterion', 'requirement escalation system', 'laptop look', 'need laptop weekend', 'path resolution', 'tech pleasant', 'hand tie asus support', 'professional support vendor product', 'product support']"

"Plain and simple, I love this computer. It is exactly what I was looking for. The size and convenience are ideal for at home use as well as travel. I chose this particular model based on word of mouth and written reviews. Of particular importance to me were battery life, processor speed, wireless n, and quality of construction (particularly the keyboard). I have been very pleased so far. I can charge the computer at night and get a full day out of it with what I consider average-frequent use.

Initially, I was very hesitant about Windows 7 Starter. I know people have mixed feelings about it, but I really like it. I have yet to encounter the 3 program limit some reviewers have cited. I also want to note that Asus includes their own software that allows customization of the background wallpaper despite the fact that Windows 7 Starter doesn't allow that on its own.

I like the pink and white design. I know that this is a computer and NOT an accessory, but given the choice of color, I enjoyed choosing something unique and fun. The white is very nice and the pink is just subtle enough. This particular one also has a finish that appears to be more resistant to fingerprints than some of the other colors, for what it's worth.

I purchased this netbook because my husband and my best friend both have Asus netbooks and love them. I originally purchased a different but newer Asus model at a different vendor and ultimately returned it because the keyboard felt extremely cheap. Although I wasn't thrilled with that model, I think Asus makes great products and I decided I wanted to stay with this brand--I am so glad I did! Whether you decide on this one or not, I would encourage netbook buyers to look at the many different netbooks Asus offers.","['size convenience', 'ideal home use travel', 'particular model base word mouth', 'particular importance battery life processor speed wireless quality construction', 'charge computer night day', 'frequent use', 'hesitant windows starter', 'encounter program limit reviewer cite', 'note asus', 'customization background wallpaper', 'fact windows starter', 'pink white design', 'computer accessory', 'choice color', 'unique fun', 'white nice pink subtle', 'particular finish', 'resistant fingerprint color', 'worth purchase netbook husband good friend asus netbook', 'different new asus model', 'different vendor', 'return keyboard', 'great product', 'netbook buyer look', 'different netbook asus']"
"I have had dozens of desktops and laptops going way back to my IBM PC25, 1984. Just like any other products you get what you pay for. There are netbooks that out of the box will cost you $700 to $900, but you selected a product in the high $200 to low $300 range. And for that price this is one very nice netbook. The Atom N280 is a couple of generations old now, but very adequate. Just like any computer when you buy on the cheap you will find the performance isn't up to expectations of the higher priced system you didn't want to pay for. How many of us hated the speed of our desktop or laptop until we upgraded the RAM, and then Wow it was great. So if you want faster and more features, well go spend more for those features and find the notebook that matches up. On this system I went to 2 GB of RAM and upgraded to Windows 7 Home Premium, since I had several Win7 upgrades that were offered last year at $49 here on Amazon. I have Office 2007 and a lot of other software that is also on my Laptop and desktop and it all works great. I sync all my files on all my systems so the software is mirrored on the notebook just like the other systems. I also have a newer HP 210-1090NR with an Atom N450 1.66. The HP has 1 GB of RAM and cannot be upgraded to 2 GB no matter what operating system you have.  Side by side this 1005HA-MU17 and the HP are equally as fast when I run identical tasks or programs at the same time on both.  The HP cost me $180 more than the 1005HA-MU17. So faster processor but less memory is equal to slower processor more memory.

"I just spent 52 infuriating minutes on the phone with three successive levels of Asus customer service representatives.  At the end, I'm left with a $330 paperweight, formerly my Eee PC Seashell 1005HA netbook.

I bought it from Amazon on August 13 2009 and used it for four months, until December 30, when the power adapter failed, leaving me with no way to charge the device or receive power from the line cord.  I called Asus tech support, and, following their advice, brought it back to life by plugging and unplugging the brick from the line several times.  Yesterday, March 1 2010, the adapter stopped working again, but I couldn't resuscitate it this time.  When I called Asus tech support, they had no other solution and, incredibly, told me that since the six-month warranty had expired 15 days before, no further service could be provided.  This was insulting on two counts: most reputable manufacturers honor their warranties for a reasonable extended grace period and, in any case, it was a recurrence of a problem that I had first reported well within the warranty period.  I could only believe that the representative was unfamiliar with company policies for such a situation, so I asked her to pass me up to her supervisor.  Same refusal.  I asked for the next-level supervisor.  Same refusal, except that this supervisor agreed to convey my case to yet another office, with no promise of any reply.

I see today that Amazon sells the appropriate adapter for $16.50.  I'm incredulous that for this petty price Asus is willing to sacrifice a previously happy customer and endure the word-of-mouth consequences.

"I have been using this netbook regularly for the past 9 years. I originally purchased the device for its size and portability, but found that it didn't really have the horsepower to keep up with Windows 7 (Starter Edition). After several months, I chose to upgrade the system RAM from 1GB to 2GB, which definitely helped, but it was still pretty laggy, especially when surfing the web. After several years of so-so performance I installed Linux Mint 17 (now 18) on the machine and boy what a difference that made. The netbook went from being a machine that I kept in the bag most of the time to becoming my daily driver. The sluggish, laggy performance with Windows 7 was replaced with snappy, responsive performance that, in conjunction with the small form factor, made the netbook an ideal on-the-go device. I can safely say 9 years after my original purchase that the machine is significantly faster today running Linux Mint than it was when brand new running Windows 7 Starter. My wife and I own a multi-million dollar IT services company, and this netbook has been serving as my primary business ""laptop"""" for the past 5 years.

"Asus nearly has the netbook PC perfected.  The size and ergonomics of this keyboard are bar none the best among netbooks today.  The wide touchpad has the right level of sensitivity as well. And Windows 7, even with the entry level Starter edition, offers much faster processing & bootup times than Windows XP does on the Intel Atom N270 processor.

However, the Asus Eee 1005HA has its achilles heel in mechanical design.  The 250GB HDD has undamped vibrations that pass throughout the chassis and straight into your wrists.  The fan also runs excessively.  The combination creates high levels of noise and vibration compared to similar netbooks such as the Acer Aspire One D250.  Also, even without Anti-Virus software running, Windows 7 and the preloaded software consume 40% of the available 1GB of memory.

Asus will undoubtedly be working out the kinks in this netbook, but many users will find the vibration and noise levels to be unacceptable, especially when other manufacturers offer netbooks without these concerns.  Once Asus releases a thermally cool, vibrationless version with 2GB DDR2 memory, this netbook will be unstoppable.

Update:  after exchanging for a second 1005HA, it has the exact same vibration issues.

"I've owned the Asus for a about a month-and-a-half now, and have been very happy with it's performance and size.  I did purchase a 2GB stick of RAM for it, which I would recommend, as well as a small carrying case to keep things neat.  It has worked flawlessly to date.  I remember reading someone's review indicating that it seemed to get overly warm with operation; I have not found that to be the case.  Asus indicates the battery should run for 8.5 hours between charges, but I suspect under normal operation that might be a bit overly-optimistic.  That being said, the battery does last quite a while before a re-charge is needed, and I like the fact that I can replace the battery myself if needed.  It also runs very quietly and that's a plus.  I'm running most of my desktop apps on this machine as well and have had no issues.

we got the netbook as an addition to the couple of laptops we have.  It is perfect for web browsing and watching movies from netflix/youtube/etc.

The battery seems to last a long time.  I haven't timed it so I don't know if it actually lasts 8.5 hrs.

I really like the way the touch pad works.  It's not as sensitive as some I've used and that's good for me.

I use it for reading online books from [...] by using EeeRotate [...] which allows me to rotate the screen and the touchpad 90 degrees clockwise.

Works great for checking mail and browsing the web.

The screen is very small, but that's the sacrifice for the small size.

"I bought this computer to take with me out of state to police school.  I was not happy with Windows Starter so I upgraded to the next level.  BAD move.  I then put on Office 7, word, excel and powerpoint....ANOTHER BAD MOVE.  After about 10 days of the computer working fine,  on the 11th day I opened my screen to Skype, and the screen was in a constant roll and was fading in and out.  I tried to reboot and took battery out etc...  Still no answer to the problem.
I called tech support THE BIGGEST BAD MOVE I made except for buying this computer!  The person on the other end (not of this country) was rude, unhelpful and just plain a sarcastic female dog.  She walked me through everything I did before calling her and was speaking down to me like I was a child, even after I explained to her that I did everything she is telling me.  Finally after 45 minutes of her crap, she told me I would have to send the computer in so that they can fix the computer because I must be doing something wrong.  I sent the computer back to Asus, had to pay for my s/h and then finally got the computer back 15 days from when I sent it.
Needless to say, I am selling this peice of junk and will NEVER do businss with Asus again.  Even though they have one of the longest warranties in the industry, it does help if you have a jerk on the other end.
Come to find out....you SHOULD NOT upgrade the Windows Starter on the netbooks because it uses too much memory for the chip and you should not install Office 7 either.

"The Bad: Windows 7 Starter SUCKS! Speakers SUCK (but headphones are good)! Lack of Bluetooth +/-. Reported battery life - not quite the stated 8.5 hours, but still excellent at about 6.

The Good: Nice HD capacity (250GB).  Good screen (esp. if u use Chrome).  Enough guts to use OO.o.  Works well with Win XP.  One-button touchpad on/off NICE!!!  Full-sized right SHIFT key (with reconfigured arrow keys) NICE!!! ASUS software package is good.

The Verdict: I bought this netbook as a replacement for my other ASUS netbook (1001 I think) with a 40GB SSD.  I loved the earlier netbook but the storage capacity wasn't enough. When I installed CPU intensive applications (e.g. 120 years of National Geographic on DVD run from the HD) the CPU found itself in the Everglades.  However, this netbook is everything I need in a lightweight computer with good storage capacity, connectivity, office suite compatibility and speed, screen size, keyboard layout, portability, and overall ease of use.  THIS NETBOOK IS NOT A REPLACEMENT FOR A DESKTOP COMPUTER OR A MUSCULAR LAPTOP.

Thus, if you have a copy of XP handy or are Linux competent and have a pair of headphones handy, this IS your lightweight machine.

P.S.  I believe I've had this netbook for about a year or so and have definitely put it through some paces.

"Well, I live in Brazil and I just bought this (3 weeks ago) and everything is OK... The netbook is beautiful, light weight and very handy but from the first moment till now I have a terrible noise on de left speaker... sounds like a radio without station. I can't change on Amazon because I bought in US and the Brazilian ASUS support doesn't want to help me. :(
About the computer, it was a gift to my wife and she loved it. The battery goes long but 5 hours maximum... 8.5 as advertized, no way! Five hours is enough for us, so, we are happy with it! The keyboard is OK for her (small hands) but not so OK for my (very big hands)... the screen is to small to work all day long, so I do recommend to use as a second notebook (like us)...
The performance is OK for office and internet... but, like Michael would say, this is it!
Windows 7 started seems good for the atom270 processor but is too much for it to do more than one task at the same time, like copy lots of file and streaming a video (youtube)... so for a second notebook, not bad!
Windows 7 starter is a little poor and it doesn't have some configurations. I think if your objective is to access internet in a mall or during a traffic jam, this is the right product.","['ok netbook', 'beautiful light weight', 'handy moment till terrible noise', 'radio station', 'brazilian asus support', 'computer gift wife', 'maximum advertize way hour', 'happy keyboard ok', 'small hand ok', 'big hand screen', 'small work day', 'performance ok office internet', 'michael windows', 'good atom processor task time', 'copy lot file stream video youtube', 'bad windows starter', 'poor configuration', 'objective access internet mall traffic jam']"
"I bought this computer basically for browsing the Internet and doing other minor tasks, listening to music, creating documents, watching TV and Movies etc. I haven't run any labor intensive programs yet (I've only had it for a couple days). I was going to play around with it for a while before deciding to upgrade to the 2GB RAM. So far so good. I haven't had any of the HD vibrations or excessive noise the other reviewer had. The battery life is phenomenal. I can't believe I can use a laptop this long and not have to be plugged in.

My only gripe is the Windows 7 Starter that comes installed. I have heard great things about ""7"""" and couldn't wait to try it.

"I've had this computer for at least 6 weeks now, so I have had a little bit of time to play with it. I bought it mostly for surfing the web and typing, I'm a writer so the convenience of a netbook was something I really wanted.

Overall I've loved the computer. It is small and lightweight, with a sleeve I can carry it in my purse or bookbag. The battery life is a lot better than my old laptop and the power chord is nice and long, so not a hassle to have plugged in when I'm at home. The mousepad works really well, better than some of the other ones I've seen on netbooks. I read in one of the other reviews about the vibrating and noise this computer makes, and I haven't had an issue with that at all.

There are a couple things I've noticed to be a hassle on the computer though. The mousepad buttons are sometimes hard to use, though once you get used to it they aren't so bad. When certain programs pop up, like quick info on a product from a website or iTunes, sometimes the screen can't fit it all and there is no way to scroll through. I guess a lot of programs are just made for computers with a larger screen. Windows 7 starter has a lot of limitations, but that's to be expected.

Overall this is a great netbook, especially for students or people looking to surf the web and write.

"I never even booted Windows on this, (though from what I understand, Asus will not refund more than six dollars of the Microsoft Tax.)

Sound and wireless worked with Fedora, Ubuntu and ArchLinux.  I also have an Asus 1000HE.  This is a bit smaller and lighter.

I give it a 4, rather than a 5, for a few reasons, most of which have been stated in other reviews.  It's a fingerprint magnet.  The jack for the power cord seems very fragile.  The touchpad, and its single bar, rather than a right and left click button, is a nuisance. In Linux at least, I can't use two finger scrolling.  The touchpad is bumpy and there's a smooth area to the right that will work for one finger scrolling.  Note that this is in Linux, I don't know how it works in Windows.

Other than that, it's a netbook.  It's small, not that powerful, but fine for browsing, reading ebooks, skype (though probably better with headphones), documents and the like.

It's pretty similar to the 1000HE, with the upside of less size and weight, plus a better keyboard (full size right hand shift key this time), but with a flimsier connector from power cord to computer and that touch pad.

I remember years ago, the Gateway Arc 200 (an ultralight--but not a netbook, it was rather expensive at the time) had the middle mouse button as a little wheel on a bar above the touchpad.  I've never seen it since, but for me, at least, it was the most convenient trackpad equivalent of a mouse button that I've used.","['boot windows', 'asus refund dollar microsoft tax', 'sound wireless work fedora ubuntu archlinux asus', 'small light reason state review fingerprint magnet jack power cord fragile touchpad single', 'click button nuisance linux use finger', 'touchpad bumpy', 'smooth area', 'work finger', 'note linux', 'work windows netbook', 'small powerful fine browse reading ebook skype', 'headphone document', 'upside size weight', 'keyboard size', 'key time flimsy connector power cord computer touch', 'gateway arc ultralight netbook', 'expensive time middle mouse button', 'convenient trackpad', 'equivalent mouse button']"
"I bought this netbook in November,  upgraded the memory to 2 gigs and upgraded the OS to Win 7 Home Premium.  I've been generally happy with the performance of the machine, the battery life and its ability to display downloaded movies from Amazon Unbox.  My big issue is that I have had intermittent charging problems.  I can't tell if the problem is the adapter or the system board. The adapter gets very hot at the tip, and the laptop gets very hot in the area where the adapter connects.  I'm talking burn your finger hot.  And sometimes the AC adapter just won't charge the thing at all.  Keep trying, a few days later it will mysteriously work.  So I called Asus technical support and went through the troubleshooting with them.  All their suggestions didn't do anything; then while the analyst had me on hold to get an RMA number, it started to work again.  Very, very strange problem.  Anyways, the netbook is on its way back to Asus (at MY expense).  I hope they can resolve the problem as I love traveling with a netbook.  I have read many reviews which leads me to believe mine is NOT an isolated incident.

I also have an Acer Aspire One netbook that I had bought for my mom.  It works just fine and the way the adapter plugs in seems to be better than the Asus.  I like the netbook solution, especially for traveling light on a plane or in the car.

Edit - 4/20/2010 - My Asus was returned to me yesterday and it appears the system board was replaced.  Everything seems to be working much better and I am happy at the moment.  Also, I have compared the Asus display to the Acer display and the Asus is much brighter and easier to view.  Those of you with charging problems - I recommend sending the unit back to Asus and recommend they change the system board.","['netbook november upgrade memory gig upgrade os', 'happy performance machine battery life ability display download movie amazon unbox', 'big issue intermittent', 'problem adapter system board adapter', 'hot tip laptop', 'hot area adapter', 'burn finger', 'hot ac adapter', 'charge thing', 'technical support', 'suggestion analyst hold rma number', 'strange problem anyways netbook way asus expense hope', 'travel netbook', 'review lead', 'incident acer aspire netbook', 'mom work', 'fine way adapter plug', 'netbook solution', 'light plane car edit asus return', 'system board', 'happy moment', 'asus display acer display asus', 'bright easy view charge problem', 'unit asus', 'system board']"
"Unfortunately, I bought this netbook as an impulse buy (the husband's computer died, and he took over my Mac Mini). Therefore, I didn't do as much research as I should have. Overall, it's a nice little machine for its price. The things you need to look out for are:

1. Operating System - this machine has Windows 7 Starter, which is pretty much Microsoft's concilliatory gesture to the manufacturers to keep their costs down. How? By getting rid of features and passing the cost down to us.

2. Display - the highest resolution you can get is 1024x600. Rumor has it you can tweak it to a higher resolution. However, if you're not comfortable with playing with drivers, the shorter display size might annoy you. Many programs and sites, like Yahoo! Mail, require 1024x768 for optimum performance.

3. Bluetooth - I thought this model had it, but I see no sign of it. There are different sub-models to the 1005HA, so double-check!

4. Single trackpad button - a bit annoying, if you're not used to it. I get around it by sacrificing one of my USB slots for a mouse.

Other than those annoyances, I am impressed with this little machine. Upgrading to 2GB of RAM makes it even smoother. For those of you unfamiliar with changing memory, there are YouTube videos that demonstrate the process. The keyboard is also nice and large, for a netbook.

In short, this is a decent machine for its price and for light use.

UPDATE: 2/2/10:
By Jan 28, I had figured out how to get pseudo 1240x780 resolution (it involves downloading Windows XP VGA drivers from ASUS and choosing the options to run them with XP compatibility). I took it for its first outside run on Jan 29. It lasted a good 3-4 hours, with only 1/2 the battery power used. However, once I got it home, the display would not show. My husband and I disconnected and reconnected the battery. The display cam up, but with a bunch of vertical lines. I am in the midst of exchanging with Amazon, and I hope the replacement machine does not do the same as the original.","['netbook impulse', 'husband computer', 'mac mini research overall', 'nice little machine price thing need look', 'system machine windows starter', 'pretty microsoft concilliatory gesture manufacturer cost', 'cost display high resolution rumor tweak high resolution', 'comfortable play driver', 'short display size annoy program site', 'optimum performance bluetooth', 'different sub model', 'double check single trackpad button bit', 'sacrifice usb slot mouse annoyance', 'machine upgrade gb ram', 'memory youtube video', 'process keyboard', 'nice large netbook', 'short decent machine price', 'light use update jan figure pseudo resolution', 'download windows xp vga driver asus', 'option run xp compatibility', 'run jan', 'good hour battery power', 'husband disconnect reconnecte battery display cam bunch vertical line midst exchange amazon hope replacement machine']"

"I am writing this review because I was agonizing over buying this and I couldn't find any reviews on it, which usually is not a good thing. It's been about two weeks of heavy use and I plan on updating this as time goes on. First, I searched for about two months and considered  every conceivable configuration of laptop trying to find what I wanted. I concluded I wanted a light 12.1 inch laptop with an optical drive that had decent speed and battery life. I was fairly certain that configuration didn't exist and was about to buy the ul30 without the optical drive, when I stumbled on this bad boy.

Pros:

SIZE!! I really think this is the perfect size form factor for anyone who has to carry a computer on a daily basis; not so thin I am afraid I will snap it in half but not so think and heavy I break my arm carrying it to work (my old laptop was 6 lbs and this one is 4, soooo much better). It's about the size of two or three magazines stacked on top of each other. It slips right in my briefcase and I hardly notice it.  The screen size is actually more than big enough, I absolutely love the size of this thing.

ASUS backing their product - ASUS offers a free 2 full years of warranty on this product plus a free year of accidental damage coverage. To buy this for an apple costs $200 at least. I know they're good for it because they offered to fix my computer when I had an issue (see support)

Light up keyboard - this wasn't even on my radar but now that I have it it's probably my favorite feature. It just looks good. I can type with ease at night while I'm watching TV or any dim light situation. You might think you wouldn't use it but I was surprised by how convenient it is. Also, when it's bright it automatically shuts itself off to save battery. I read a lot about this ""keyboard flex"""" issue.  I now see what people were talking about.

I decided to buy this laptop because it's size was perfect for me, I travel a lot and I needed something that I could easily carry.

"This laptop is slick.  I purchased this to replace a failing four year old Macbook.  With a battery life of around eleven hours in a low power mode, the laptop is ultra-portable.  Kicking into a higher performance mode takes a few seconds and leaves you with a little under half of the maximum battery life.  The touchpad is a bit unconventional and I'm still getting used to it.  It is completely level with the surface of the laptop and I have found my fingers like to wander off the edges of the usable area.  The instant-on splashtop was a nice surprise.  I wasn't even aware of the functionality when I purchased the computer.  The applications are very basic and the music player rates pretty low on the intuitive features list but it does play music after you have your playlists set up.  Though it is fairly big, it's just as thin and lightweight. I don't plan to do any serious gaming on the computer, but I do play EVE.  It ran quite well with the G210M on.

"I give only 3 stars to this laptop because it uses a cheap processor.

The Intel T6600 processor costs less, which is why laptops with this type of CPU cost less, but that is at the expense of some pretty important features.

The biggest problem is that this laptop's CPU does not support Hardware Assisted Virtualization (VT). This means you cant use the XP mode offered by Windows 7 Ultimate. You cant run VM's on the majority of Virtualization products (VMWARE, VirtualPC).

There is a workaround for XP mode by using VMLite, but this is the single biggest weak point of this laptop.

Otherwise I find it ok. Returning this laptop for lack of VT means Amazon will charge their usual 15% restocking fee and its not worth that.

My advise is that if you are a serious user who likes advanced features, look around for a laptop with a better processor. If you are looking for a cheap system with reasonable specs then choose this.

You will never be able to enjoy Win 7 Ultimate (with all its features) on this laptop.

"Very good value considering features and price. Was looking for a notebook with 13.3in screen and CD/DVD Player.

Has bluetooth, HDMI, Wireless a/b/g/n and 2.2GHZ cpu, lighted keyboard and multitouch touchpad, all good to have besides the usual base feature set.

Appears too glossy for me and certainly a fingerprint magnet. The mousepad could have been better designed. It's a little bit too small and the clicker feels awkward, but I guess I might get used to it soon. The screen looks very good but the default setup was a little too bright so I adjusted it down a little.

Runs pretty cool and reasonably quiet. Compared side by side with a Sony VGN-SR390 13.3in and I liked the looks of the Sony better. But the U80V is about 500.00 cheaper and the Sony's keyboard is not lighted. I choose the ASUS for features and value but honestly my heart was with the Sony. :-)

"For the past few months, I was looking to replace my old Acer laptop with a new one. I was attracted by ASUS because of their Global Two year warranty and One Year accidental damage. I was looking for a laptop that offers
- Decent Battery Life
- Is under 5 lbs
- 14 inch screen which I think is ideal for desktop replacement at home and also easy to carry around
- Backlit Keyboard
- Dedicated Graphics.

I tried two similar laptops but now finally decided to stay with this U80V-B2. The other laptop that were on my list were Toshiba E205 and ASUS UL80.

Toshiba E205 -
 I first tried New TOshiba E205 which is recently launched at BestBuy. ALthough E205 has backlit keyboard, slot loading DVD drive and the new Core- i5 processor, I decided to return that beacause- It would get quite warm on the keyboard and touchpad which is rare among ASUS laptops that I have tried. The palm rest of E205 was kinda small and uncomfortable. IT was also not as snappy as I expected although it featured new Core-i5 processor.

ASUS UL80-
Although the UL80 has a slim profile with brushed Aluminium lid, featured a Core 2 DUO processor, has rated 8 hrs real life battery life, I missed a backlit keyboard and Bluetooth. The ULV processor was not smooth for some heavy multitasking and the touch pad was a disaster.

Finally I decided that U80V-B2, which is infact a older model than UL80, would best suit my needs at least based on its specification. When I saw its price came down to $ 699 at amazon, I decided to buy it and got it just yesterday. So far I am pretty much impressed with it for the value i paid for it.

The touch pad is a breeze to use, although its located more towards the right and not in center. The multi-touch features work great. The back-lit keayboard is also awesome since you can adjust the brightness. It has bluetooth so that I have been able to syncronize my cell-phone and use my bluetooth wireless mouse. The laptop remains super cool after a prolong use also and is very quiet. I have been able to get 5 hours battery life on Battery saving mode which is not bad for a 6-cell battery. Overall, its the most efficiently made laptop i have ever tried. You can find more expensive laptops out there, but this laptop gives you back the every penny you invested with features no other laptop gives at that price.

"Laptop looks great, very thin and light.  So far, it also works well: 4gb RAM is pretty fast, graphics and sound quality are good, loving the chiclet keyboard.  The only thing that could be better is the mouse pad, right click is a little hard to use, but it doesn't take long to get used to it.  Also, the battery life seems a little short, only about 3-4 hrs, but I have yet to fully test that.  Overall, I'm very happy that I got this laptop!","['laptop look', 'great thin light', 'work gb ram', 'pretty fast graphic', 'sound quality good', 'chiclet keyboard thing', 'hard use', 'long battery life', 'short hrs', 'test overall']"
"I own both the UL30A-A2 and the UX30-A1.  The UX is MUCH lighter than the UL and look so much better.  Since all the ports are hidden, the laptop has a very clean look.  What i love most about the UX is that the screen is flushed making it look very elegant.  The screen brightness is the same as the UL.  The UX is also thinner.  Battery life is ok, not as great as on the UL but i don't mind since i bought this mainly because of the exterior.  The brushed aluminum makes the laptop feels so much more expensive than it really is.  One other thing, the hard drive and battery are not removable.  They have been sealed by Asus so if having a removable battery is important to you, you should look at other models.","['ul ux ux', 'light ul look', 'port hide laptop', 'clean look', 'ux screen flush', 'elegant screen brightness ul ux', 'thin battery life ok', 'great ul mind', 'exterior brush aluminum', 'expensive thing', 'hard drive battery', 'removable seal asus', 'removable battery', 'important look model']"

"Simple personal feeling about this Asus UX30

The Good side

1. Good CPU speed, I'm a student using the laptop mainly for homework/study/web/movies/youtube. It's not a lighting speed one but I'm totally happy with it's performance --- no lag! I think the 4GB ram definitely help.

2. Super thin and sleek outlook and excellent built quality. Asus built the laptop with brushed aluminum on the top and high-end plastic on the bottom, which make it feels like you are holding a $1xxx latop :D,

3. Surprise how light the latop is, I can spin it with my finger! no kidding~ Also the power adapter is the smallest I've ever seen, the adapter is about the length of a lighter and 3 times of it's size and super light as well.

4. Crispy screen playing 1080p video smoothly, No problem using HDMI output on 56inches TV.

5. I think a lot of people would concern about the battery life, well, I can honestly tell you it's really not that bad, for normal web browsing it can last 4.5hrs using the battery saving mode, and don't be scared by hearing battery saving equal to low performance, in fact I just feel the same as the high performance mode except using dimmer screen brightness. The battery is in fact a high end POLYMER battery instead of standard one on other laptops, it's more reliable and has longer life.

6. Asus Express Gate installed. EG let you get on internet do most stuff without booting the windows, it's Linux based os customized for Asus laptop. As advertised get connected online and start browsing the web in 8 Sec (tested, takes 6sec! ^^)

6. Elegant package make you feeling like unboxing a macbook air ^^

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

The Bad side

1. Weak microphone, I use the video chat on Skype and live messenger a lot, the microphone just doesn't useful as the one who you chat with couldn't hear any but noise from you. Disappointed. Problem Solved by bought a usb audio interface for $9.99, it work perfectly now.

2. It would be a little tough to get used to the touch pad, but in few days, you'll be OK and enjoy, still cant compare to Mac's touch pad.

Overall, it's a great value to purchase this notebook, I'm happy using it everyday in school and home. everything just great. Highly recommended for student or people who love to use their laptop the way I do, Web browsing/homework/movies/Youtube/video chat/

I did not wanted to make the same mistake that I made the last time by buying an underpowered pc. This ASUS N61JQ-A1 has a lot of power and it is a beautiful system.  Something that I was concern about when I bough it on-line was the color. On line is described as being a dark brown. It is dark brown but it is so dark that it looks black and in addition the pattern in the design is awesome. I bough mine at Costco on-line because they offer the best return policy that I know of and they had the best price I could find. I was tented to buy the ASUS G51 which has almost the same components and in addition better resolution for a bit more money but I am glad I pick the N61JQ-A1 because of the elegant look. The G51's design is just not cut out for the work environment because of its extravagant looks. The good thing is that the screen resolution has not been an issue for me when I play some games. This is a one for all laptop because it can be used for almost everything and is a very nice machine.

"The N61JQ-X1, simply put, is a great laptop...

Pros:
Blazing speed - and this only w/ 4 gig of RAM... (granted, I'm leaving an early core duo, so... it's more Honda to Porsche, not Porsche to Ferrari).
Windows 7, 64 bit (I put the bar on the left, and it changes the game...)
Great screen
Great graphics card (high 2nd tier, but I'm not a gamer, so who cares... and directv plays great on it (just got whole home from them, and it streams my dvr).
very good sound (although I don't use it much)
NUMBER KEYPAD!!! I used to hate typing numbers on laptops - no more!
HUGE screen - yet fairly light
Not very hot- no more burned wrists (although it is quite hot back towards the screen... so watch your laps!!!)
and... last... but not least!!!!

IT IS CHEAP (for what it is)... I tried to buy it here, but thought about it too long, and missed the half a C-note under a G, but was still in time for the end of cashback from MS - I sure will miss that program.

Cons:
ASUS bloatware - easily remedied
awkward placement of power plug - I like laying the laptop down on it's side - and this doesn't allow me to.
as others have noted - it will be covered with fingerprints... again- who cares.
Wireless N is single band (only 2.4, no 5ghz)

All in all - I could not be more pleased...
Granted - it's only a week in, so much left to see, but overall, I don't regret leaving my many year long, abusive relationship with D@ll... oddly enough - rhymes with h@ll!  If only my work would change too!!!

"I've had this laptop for over a year now. Although initially it just ran fairly hot, after about a year it started overheating regularly with any cpu-intensive game, and even with skype. It idles around 75 degrees celsius as a minimum on battery-saving mode. As of now unless I'm in a really cold room with a laptop cooling pad I can't even put it on high performance power mode without running the risk of overheating with anything more resource intensive than firefox.

Also, the battery and adapter stopped working just after the warranty expired.

Overall, I'm extremely disappointed. What's the point of having high-end hardware if you can't even utilize any of the power without a significant risk of overheating?

"Ill start with the cons first;
  -relatively low resolution screen (1366x768)
  -small hard drive (320gb)which is partitioned into a local os and a data segment (with a small hidden partition for recovery)
  -webcam is relatively worthless
  -bloatware (useless programs that come installed on the laptop)
  -runs rather hot but I knew this would be the case
  -short batterlife, but again, I knew this going in
  -only 3 usb ports (usb 3.0 port = backwards compatible)

now the pros
  -awesome graphics card, the 5730, which supports directx 11, and at the given resolution it can support most games on relatively high settings. (remember, we'r talking about a laptop)
  -core i7 720q; great mobile processor. very capable, its debatable whether or not your better off going with this or an good i5 processor, but it depends what your doing. since I wanted to do mobile 3d modeling and animation, I went with the quad core. the laptop is surprisingly only a fraction slower than my desktop, which is a core i7 950 overclocked w 2 gb more ram.
  -usb 3.0 + card reader + hdmi + eSATA + bluetooth and more = :)

I would suggest this laptop to anyone. Its fast and capable, and is a suitable solution to my needs. for a quad core processor, and a capable graphics card, most comparable laptops are hundreds more. The only things Im still unhappy with is all the bloatware; it must be newer stuff because I still cant find solid reviews on what I can delete without crippling something. Also, whatever genius decided they needed to partition the hard drive needs to be found and put on an island somewhere where he can do no more damage. with 320gb of hard drive, I would much rather prefer having it all in one place. This is of course fixable with some freeware offline, and if I had more experience with that, I would have fixed the partitions, but I dont, so I didnt. Ill probably just hook up a terabyte hard drive to the esata port eventually anyways, so im not worried. all in all, laptop is a good deal, but for the specs, there are definitely some aspects being sacrificed. (oh and I dont know why they havent figured out yet that I (and most geeks like me) have oily hands. quit making laptops shiny fingerprint magnets!)

"I've had this laptop for just over 2 years now, and I have to say, I'm impressed. It has a couple quirks, but for what I payed for it, it's a champ, any issues I had with it I've been able to resolve myself, first off, I'll list the cons that I've run into in my 2 years of laptop ownership.

CONS:
1. HEAT - This laptop is by no means a lightweight, this is a desktop replacement, boasting a beefy i7 processor that runs standard at 1.6 GHz, and goes up as needed to 2.2. That means this thing pumps out quite a bit of heat, idling usually around 60 degrees Celsius, going up to 85 under max load. That being said, the cooling system used is very efficient, as long as you keep the fan clear (easily reached through the bottom panel) and don't block the port, you won't have issues with it. Not once during the time I've had this laptop has it overheated, through basic use, through Minecraft, Mass Effect, Just Cause, and pretty much anything else I've thrown at it.

2. HARD DRIVE - Just about a year after I got the laptop, the hard drive died in a spectacular crash during use, but as a 320G drive is barely passable these days, not a big issue for me. The issue actually came up after I popped in the nice and roomy new 750GB drive, where a number of windows functions didn't appear to work. This was resolved simply by reinstalling the Intel Storage Utility, as the driver in the laptop didn't fully support drives that large.

3. BSOD - This guy had me stumped for a good long time, randomly during use, I would get a Blue Screen directed towards the USB 3.0 Driver crashing, fiddling with the bios, reformatting, and trying different drivers did nothing, so I chalked it up to a hardware issue UNTIL I discovered that the problem was easily fixable in windows settings. Turns out the 3.0 port doesn't like being put on standby to save power, so just switching all the settings in device manager to not allow windows to do that fixed all problems.

So, in summary, for the cons, Keep your exhaust port clean and open, Intel Storage Utility for big drives, and power settings for the USB ports in Device Manager. Do this and you'll be as happy as a clam with this laptop.

The nicest thing I note about this laptop is that it has room to grow, you don't pay through the nose up front for easy upgrades you can make later. Hard Drive? A little small, but it's a standard, just pop in a new one, takes maybe 5 minutes, same with the RAM, starts at 4, and  goes up to 8 whenever you feel like it.","['laptop year', 'couple quirk pay champ issue', 'con run year laptop ownership cons heat laptop', 'lightweight desktop replacement', 'beefy processor run', 'standard ghz', 'thing pump bit heat', 'degree celsius', 'max load', 'cool system', 'panel block port', 'issue time laptop overheat', 'basic use minecraft mass effect', 'drive year', 'hard drive', 'spectacular crash use drive', 'passable day', 'big issue issue', 'nice roomy', 'new gb drive number window function', 'reinstall intel storage utility driver laptop', 'support drive', 'large bsod guy stump good', 'long time', 'blue screen', 'direct usb driver', 'fiddle bio reformatte', 'different driver', 'hardware issue', 'fixable window setting', 'power switch setting device manager', 'window fix problem summary', 'con exhaust port', 'clean open intel storage utility', 'big drive power setting usb port device manager', 'happy clam laptop', 'nice thing note laptop room', 'easy upgrade', 'hard drive', 'small standard', 'minute ram']"
"Decided to pull the trigger and bought this when Amazon brought the price down to $909 + free shipping.

Pros:
- i7 + 5730 + 4GB of RAM + USB 3.0 for $909 is a great value
- Quiet hard drive
- Nice feel when typing (this is my first laptop with a chiclet style keyboard)
- The dark brown cover actually looks good
- Overall system performance is superb, multitasking is a breeze and never slowed down in spite having over 20 spreadsheets open, playing a bit of Zero Hour in Windows XP mode, uTorrent downloading, and Norton getting updates
- Built-in glass screen protector
- The range of its built-in WiFi antenna is pretty good, strong connections even if the router is in our living room and I'm using this in an upstairs bedroom.

Cons:
- A bit of flex on the keyboard
- In spite of its multimedia bias, the speakers are woefully weak. Bought a generic version of Logitech's clip-on speakers, and it made a world of difference.
- The fan on its right side seems to be continuously blowing hot air, fortunately the laptop remains pretty quiet
- Had to update most of the devices on it as the drivers installed were already out of date (BIOS, Chipset, Camera, LAN, WLAN, Bluetooth, USB 3 port, ATI Catalyst, Hotkeys, HDMI Audio, etc.)

What Its Missing:
- A backlit keyboard, though there are hacks on the internet if you want to install one. Personally, I just bought a USB LED light.
- An option for higher resolution screen as this really would benefit from at least a 1920x1080 display
- An option for a 9-cell battery

"I recently purchased this laptop(arrived 07/28/1987) and have had a few days to play with it.

First of all I think this laptop is very nice and has a couple of nice features as many have said such as the i7, antec lansing speakers, cost, etc but what I will write about is are the cons I have personally experienced from the usage of this computer.

First off if you are buying this computer for gaming just note that the Radeon HD 5730 has many issues to many of the modern games.

Starcraft 2: It crashes very frequently on this computer. The default drivers just won't do. Upgrade the drivers to the new 10.7 catalyst drivers right away and then if you are lucky it might not crash as often. I wouldn't blame this entirely on the graphics card since Starcraft 2 is have a multitude of problems with ATI graphics cards at the moment.

Dragon Age Origins: Same with Starcraft 2 works but crashes from time to time. Make sure to upgrade your dragon age to the newest version and have the 10.7 drivers. I played this game for 5 hrs and it crashed about 3 times. ATI issues same with SC2.

Mass Effect 2: Runs very smoothly. No Problems (but have heard on many forums this game had many issues with ATI cards.)

Others:

FN key not working. Volume/Mute Keys are not working. I had this problem at first but after updated with ATK drivers they worked fine.

These are just a few of the problems I have personally encountered so far. Perhaps I just got a lemon iono, but after the updates to the drivers the problems seem to have either been fixed or lessened. In regards to the games. It might not necessarily be the notebook's fault, but just a few things to keep in mind. This was from my personal experience hopefully others are luckier and don't experience these problems.","['purchase laptop', 'day play', 'nice couple', 'antec lanse speaker cost etc', 'experience usage computer', 'note radeon hd issue', 'modern game starcraft crash', 'computer default driver', 'upgrade driver', 'new catalyst driver', 'lucky crash blame', 'graphic card starcraft multitude problem ati graphic card moment dragon age origins starcraft work crash time time', 'sure upgrade dragon age', 'new version driver play game hrs crash time ati issue sc mass effect run', 'forum game issue ati card fn key work volume mute keys work problem update atk driver work', 'fine problem', 'lemon iono update driver problem fix lessen regard game', 'notebook fault thing mind', 'personal experience', 'lucky experience problem']"

"DEFINITELY READ THIS BEFORE YOU BUY THIS LAPTOP
I have owned an asus before, was not bad (but it crashed on a video game and never started again) I figured maybe I was the cause of it. I bought another one, this one. Do not bother purchasing it. This laptop will suck your time dry. I have had numerous problems that took up many hours of online research, and phone calls, and more money.
PROBLEMS 1) Within minutes of starting my computer for the first time, I GET the BLUE screen of death. Took me awhile to figure this one out. Unfortunately my left USB port would allow a plug to go in upside down and shorted the system. NO GOOD, 2)Screen quality is junk 3) Video games are not very compatible with this laptop. Many hours fixing bugs and downloading driver updates, and patches. 4) During video games there will be a line that goes across the screen and breaks up the graphics for a split second during cinematic, but frequently and in different locations-just odd. 5)The battery life is horrible, it will say 2 hours-you will be lucky if you get 1 and half.  I thought I read somewhere that this thing got 10 hours! I looked over something there. 6)DVD drive just stopped working. I DO NO KNOW WHY. 7)only three USB ports. 8)I had to buy a recovery cd for 60 dollars!!! because the OS crashed within the 3rd month. 9)MY LEFT mouse Button on the Laptop is starting to be unresponsive-sometimes it does not select it and now I have noticed I am putting much pressure on it to get it to work. 19)The asus live update feature is a scam!! I have never downloaded a driver from it and it always says its up to date-LIARS. HOURS of finding the drives myself. Turns out that the software they offer on there website is ALSO OUT OF DATE. I had to purchase another software (driver genius) to get the right drivers. 11)POOR customer service-long wait on the phone and no one I have talked to so far speaks clear English, but that goes for HP as well. PLAIN AND SIMPLE DO NOT BUY THIS LAPTOP, ALSO DO NOT BUY A ASUS. pure junk. there are no good laptops out there anymore though.... best computer I have ever owned- VPR Matrix.

This laptop has been my faithful companion for well over 4 years, throughout the end of middle school and much of my High School life. This laptop is special to me, as it has been the first one I'd ever gotten that actually ran the games I wanted to play effectively (my two previous laptops were Dell notebooks and they sucked real bad at gaming).

The good things about this laptop:
1) Decent for running games made from at latest 2012 to older (portal 2, skyrim, and anything older run great). Runs smoothly and is capable of handling stressful loads (or at least I remember it being that way). I had a lot of fun times playing games using this laptop for well over 4 years. It never failed me once when it came to performance (however, read the last paragraph on my review for some clarification on how the performance is NOW in 2015).
2) WINDOWS 7. I cannot stress this enough. Even now I still consider Windows 7 to be a far superior operating system to Windows 8, 8.1 and perhaps someday even 10. It is both user-friendly but not too dumbed-down and ""metro-ified"""" as Windows 8 is. I like the GUI's smooth edges that are both futuristic but not too bubbly and drab like Windows XP was. In my opinon","['laptop christmas', 'old brother laptop faithful companion year end middle school high school life laptop', 'previous laptop dell notebook suck', 'thing laptop', 'late old portal skyrim', 'old run', 'great run', 'stressful load', 'way lot fun time play game laptop year', 'paragraph review clarification performance windows stress', 'system windows someday user', 'friendly dumbe metro ifie windows', 'smooth edge futuristic', 'windows xp opinon']"
"ill tell you right off the bat that im not a laptop guy. so why i bought one puzzles even me. no matter what the specs i feel theyre a always a little slower and i guess im just paranoid about being careful with them, not only from my friends' bad experiences with laptops but with my own tendency for bad luck. anyway, with that said, please dont take everything i say with a grain of salt. i think i just need some time to get used to it.
a big cosmetic flaw (kinda) is the non-backlit keyboard. if you have the screen fairly vertical and just dont have the brightness all the way down its usable at night though. Im writing this in the dark and i can see, so any typos are just bad typing.
the battery life could be better, but isnt terrible for a laptop this size. gives about 2 hrs, even with switching to power save mode. the different power modes dont seem to do much except change the brightness. Altho the power save mode does de-color your windows theme and puts a stock Asus background.

**A big part of why i got this model was because it said it comes with powerdvd and power director. it technically does. i havent tried powerdvd yet, but power director is a stripped down version that wont even let you do PiP, which i need for my cover band.*

Other Cons;
-keyboard feels cheap. seems to warp/bend when you type.
-mouse does things i dont want it to, like zoom instead of scroll (again, non-laptop guy getting used to it. i also got a regular mouse with it)
-tons of Asus named software you think will be crucial and part of the system, its not. still have yet to sort out all the required from not
-IMO it somehow seems a little slower than it should be for a quad core (i7)
-the Libraries (music, pics, video) in windows 7 are stored in a 116 gb OS partition, which is already taken up by about 75 gb of junk (altho some may be drivers, so dont go nuts uninstalling)
-screen resolution isnt great either. in a previous review someone said you can just resize it with the mouse pad; that only works for webpages.
-the turbo boost doesnt seem to do much. you can see the meter revv up if you have itunes open and open IE or something. havent tried any games yet.
-only has Office starter (excel and stripped down Word)
-screen has a fair amount of glare.

Pros;
-battery charges quickly
-runs incredibly quiet and fairly cool for a laptop. loudest thing was the dvd burner revving up
-comes with Excel and Word (i dont do anything fancy in Word and rarly use PowerPoint anymore)
-big hard drive
-good sound (especially when connected to external surround sound)
-read my microSD when no other computer or external card reader would.
-the webcam is amusing to play with and put designs or accessories on yourself or change the color or what have you...
-great graphics card
-lots of ram. doesnt slow down when i have itunes and some windows open
-USB 3.0 was nice when transferring everything off my external from my desktop

Overall this computer is good, but as a video editor i dont really know why i switched to a laptop. For anyone else im sure itll work even better than it does for me. Anyone who does something other than film editing and/or who just likes to have a fast computer and alot of space for stuff, this is perfect for.","['bat laptop guy', 'matter spec', 'slow guess paranoid', 'careful friend', 'bad experience laptop tendency', 'bad luck', 'grain salt', 'need time', 'big cosmetic flaw', 'non backlit keyboard screen', 'brightness way', 'usable night', 'dark typo', 'battery life', 'terrible laptop size', 'hrs switch power', 'different power mode', 'color window theme', 'stock asus background', 'powerdvd power director', 'powerdvd power director strip version', 'pip need', 'band cons keyboard', 'cheap warp bend type mouse thing', 'scroll non laptop guy', 'regular mouse ton asus name software', 'crucial system sort', 'slow quad core', 'libraries music pic video windows store gb os partition', 'gb junk', 'screen resolution', 'great previous review', 'resize mouse', 'work webpage', 'turbo boost', 'meter revv itune', 'open open ie', 'office starter excel strip word screen fair glare', 'pro battery charge', 'cool laptop', 'loud thing dvd burner rev', 'excel word', 'fancy word', 'big hard drive good', 'external surround', 'microsd computer external card reader', 'design accessory', 'great graphic card lot ram', 'slow itune window', 'open usb', 'external desktop overall computer good video editor', 'switch laptop', 'sure ll work', 'film editing', 'fast computer alot space stuff']"
"I was happy with my purchase for less than a year, after which, the camera stopped working. The system would say that it was already in use, which it wasn't. I took it in and they reformatted the laptop and took off the hotkeys and it worked again but my features and hotkeys that were supposed to work on the computer no longer worked. After reinstalling the drivers and everything the camera stopped working again. The computer tech and myself came to the realization that Asus made the computer so that if you want all your hotkeys on the keyboard and features to work, they mess with the camera, but if you want your camera to work, you can't use your hotkeys and other features that the laptop is supposed to come with. It is a stupid issue that the company should be held responsible for but will not and have not found a fix to. I'm very sad I spent the money (around $800 at the time) on something that I cannot use all features on. Because I used the camera less often, I had to opt for the keyboard to work the way it was supposed to so I haven't had use of the camera almost since I bought the stupid machine. I will not purchase Asus brand again since the company couldn't even take the time to come up with a simple programming update to fix the issue. (I've read numerous other complaints all over the web from others with the same problem so it's not like it was just one complaint from one person)","['happy purchase year camera', 'work system use', 'reformatte laptop', 'hotkey work', 'hotkey suppose work computer', 'long work reinstall driver camera', 'work computer tech', 'realization asus computer', 'hotkey keyboard', 'work mess camera', 'camera work use hotkey', 'laptop suppose', 'stupid issue company hold', 'money time use', 'camera opt keyboard work way suppose use camera', 'stupid machine purchase asus brand company time', 'update fix issue', 'numerous complaint web problem', 'complaint person']"
"but...

This unit was a replacement for a N81VP which had issues from the get go.  I sent it in because of the severe keyboard clank and flex.  Web search for it and it's a known issue.  I was aware of the issue and was prepared to RMA the thing just because the specs were impressive.  I received the item back scratched up, hard drive cover not snapped in place properly and some extra added noise coming from the cpu area.  You would think that they would pay extra care to fix your laptop properly given the fact they clearly let down the customers expectations on quality control right?  To get a machine back in worse condition?  That's just not acceptable given what these things cost.

So the N61JQ-X1 is a nice looking machine as everyone has stated.  I was trilled when I saw the beauty of the thing when I received it and it made up (not really) for my troubles.  The screen takes some getting used to but it's actually very nice.  The Elan Touchpad (not Synaptics) is much nice than the crap they threw on the N81VP (also known issue on the web).  There's a minor bit of keboard flex on the left side.  At this point I can live with it.

Here's where it all breaks down again.  I loaded this thing with Windows 7 Ultimate N 64 and then reached for the included Driver's Disk.  The envelope did look a bit like someone handled before.  Loading it up I discovered the disk was completely empty.  4.7 GB free.  Nice going ASUS.  I went to the website to load the drivers.  All were confusingly there except the NEC USB 3.0 drivers.  foobar2.  A few days later I started hearing a loud and seriously annoying whine coming from the bottom edge of the laptop.  At times the high pitch sounds as though it resonates through the right hand side of the keyboard.  Swap  the hard drive out with another and still a sound.  I can barely stand using the laptop for 30 minutes as the whine is just so piercing as if you're ears are ringing.  And your ears continue to sound as if it's ringing long after you've turned off the machine.

Asus, also take note.  The power plug on the left.  That's going to be an issue in the future.  I'm not sure anyone uses these plugs anymore.  Why is the pin side of the plug on the laptop side?  It should be on the power supply side in case they get bent and require replacing.  The pin is actually 5 shards coming to a point with each shard suspect to bending if not careful.  It's like stuff that belongs in 1990s electronics.

I won't be buying another ASUS anytime in the future.  I bought into the SquareTrade hype about the most reliable computers being Asus.  It's clearly not the case.  I should of relied on my intuition.  It's just not possible for a new comer to the scene to establish that level of quality.  Frankly, hate to say it but you can't beat Dell after service for repairs.  My friend also bought an Asus desktop (i7-920) for his work and they've had nothing but issues.  2 years and 1 year accidental sounds nice.  It's not so nice when they don't fix your machine right.  It's not nice that they don't supply shipping materials for the RMA.  It's not nice when they make you pay for Advance Replacement shipping for your parts.

"The Asus N61JQ-X1's performance is excellent, when it works. That's the good. But it is too cheaply made, unreliable and has too many hardware failures. I suspect that a lot of these glowing reviews were probably done when the laptop was brand new before it stood the test of time.

I have had this laptop since September 2010 and it's now March 2013. At about a year and a half the fan went out. I replaced it, not a big deal in itself. At about the same time the video card started going out. Suddenly while working the video card puts yellow vertical stripes on the monitor while the system freezes and hangs. I have to power off and restart to use the computer again. The yellow stripe freezes/crashes have become more and more frequent. At first it was a couple times a month, now it is once a day or even more. Now I will have to buy another video card. All my other laptops lasted years without any hardware going bad. Planned obsolescence? Cheap parts and build quality? I don't know.

The Asus N61JQ-X1 is marketed as USB 3.0, the latest and greatest and ""future proof"""". What they don't tell you is that ONLY ONE of the THREE USB ports is actually USB 3.0 (the single one on the left side).

Awesome Performance so far -
playing starcraft II on ultra graphics with no problems
really good sound for a laptop
stays surprisingly cool - side vent pumps out tons of heat but laptop bottom stays relatively cool
price - great power for a moderately priced laptop

Cons:
battery life stinks- playing games ive only been getting about 1 to 1.5 hours - 2 hours if im just doing normal surfing / other tasks - thats the trade off for having this beastly processor and video card

"Initially, I was disappointed when the laptop was having startup problems after a few days upon receiving it. I sent it in for service to ASUS which was a somewhat positive experience-(ASUS has a RMA process with FEDX-shipped to ASUS via FEDX GRND. Got my laptop back in about a week.

"Bought this laptop on Amazon in July 8, for $949.99
Needed something for college and a well be future proof for at least 2 or 3 years
I must say, since this is my first laptop, it is everything I could want + more
Like all the other reviews I've read, this laptops pros are that it is absolutely fast and is powerful
Great graphics, speed, design, and is comfortable to use for hours.
Chiclet keyboard is great, I can type fast to take notes and multitask
some people complain about the resolution, but it's an great display and it hasn't failed to impress me yet
not a lot of bloatware like people said, got all the bloatware removed within like 15 - 20 minutes

Dislikes:
venting of the left side can get quite hot
fingerprint magnet on the cover, i have to clean it quite often
speakers arent that great, i use my usb speakers instead

Overall, I am well pleased with me investment and it's an awesome laptop. definitely would recommend buying!","['laptop amazon', 'need college', 'future proof year laptop', 'fast powerful great graphic speed design', 'comfortable use hour chiclet keyboard', 'great type', 'fast note multitask people complain resolution', 'great display', 'impress lot bloatware', 'minute dislike', 'hot fingerprint magnet', 'clean speaker', 'great use usb speaker', 'investment awesome laptop']"
"I have 2 laptops- an asus quad core full-sized and my asus netbook.  For everything except heavy duty gaming, I am much more likely to use the light-weight, power sipping netbook.

I have used the netbook for Microsoft Access, Word and Excel documents countless times, and it never let's me down.  I have yet to experience a crash on this machine.  It is plenty speedy for the above tasks.  I also use it to play some games on kongregate sometimes between classes.

I use a microsoft bluetooth mouse and have no perceptible lag.  I'm glad I got a netbook with bluetooth.

the battery life is about what you'd expect.  I typically get 5-6 hours out of the bat, but I can coax 10+ hours of light use by turning the display brightness down and turning on power-saver mode.

my only complaint is that the finish has come off the touchpad a bit, but it doesn't affect performance, so that is no big deal.

Onboard speakers are actually very good, resolution could be higher, but looks great, gloss finish on the screen does produce glare if not positioned right.

"Purchased in 2010 and used almost EVERY DAY since, Asus has once again has created a work of art. I never write product reviews but I had to make an exception this time for this laptop. If you're looking for a high performance laptop for all of your multi-media needs, this laptop is sure to not disappoint. I use mine everyday for video games and video editing. The Intel core i7 combined with a speedy HDD and 4GB of RAM is definitely enough to run smoothly for years to come. Also, with all of the extras this thing comes with (bluetooth, multi-finger touch-pad, USB 3.0, ect.) you wont have to worry about connectivity and will quickly be able to navigate Windows with the touch-pad shortcuts. The graphics card is definitely enough to play many earlier games from 2010 on mid to high settings, however it will unfortunately struggle with current and newer games to come. Asus has been a great company that has yet to disappoint me.

In Short,
The Good:
i7 (although it's 1st gen)
Quick HDD (7200RPM)
Bluetooth
USB 3.0

After reformatting to get rid of all that bloatware, this is a fantastic computer for the price.  But it doesn't come with Windows disks so if you don't have a legit copy you'll need to carefully remove bloatware.

Have experienced no problems at all.

And thankfully I wouldn't call it brown.  It's pretty much black.

Now, even though my husband is a top-level Windows support guy, we realize this was a mistake.  In fact his company bought 100 and had to replace the motherboards of 1/2 of them.

There are a few nuisances:

- Runs very hot (understandable for the amount of power it packs)
- Battery runs for only 2 hours max (understandable for the same reason above)
- The power gable gets in front of the vent because it's plugged very near to it. I know nothing will happen to the cable although very hot air is coming out of the vent, but this is of course a design flaw.

"This machine is reliable, fast-booting, and fast-performing, thanks to a fast processor, enough RAM and a 7200 rpm hard drive. I use the GIMP (similar to Photoshop) for graphics and Adobe Premiere Elements for video editing and it handles these tasks with ease, even with Norton Internet Security and several other things running in the background. Build quality is sound. Keyboard has a good solid feel and is plenty wide enough. Overall, it's terrific and I would buy another Asus. If you're looking for an excellent laptop at a good price, this is the one, if you ask me. There are a few drawbacks, but nothing major: I don't like the touchpad too much--it seems to have a hard time putting the cursor where I want it and I have to press down fairly hard to get the cursor to move bottom to top. It has a lot of fancy features like three-finger swipe, rotate, etc., but these were kicking in accidentally a lot, so I turned them all off. The screen has a little piece of crud in between the plastic outer cover and the actual display--not a big deal, but like an itch you can't scratch. The external off/on switch for the wi-fi & bluetooth is very handy to have, but it's right next to a USB port and it's easy to hit the switch when changing out devices and turn wi-fi off by mistake (at least with my hands).

Cons:
Cooling system

There is always something missing in Sub $1000 Laptops that make your system old in 2 years and slow to work in 3 years. The game is that Laptop manufacturers are making sure that you will come back for a new system in about 3 years. If you spend more, you improve quality of your usage on faster components, and not necessarily the life time of your machine. Laptops will generally last about 3 years on average.
What you get from this Laptop is that allows you to extend the life time of your usage for an additional 8-12 months without compromising on speed and quality of your usage. Asus is a good manufacture, however still there is no assurance that all components will work for the life time of Laptop. Nevertheless you are paying just enough to enjoy a 3 years of speedy processing and gaming, any time longer should be a bonus for you!

Suggestions:
If your System or BIOS does not recognize the 4GB of memories, and shows only 2GB, Restore the BIOS to Default (move the battery and press and hold the start key for 5 second to discharge before you turn it back on again) or call ASUS.
Asus should really think about the location of Fan or Fan auxiliary, however make sure you don't block it, especially when you place it on your lap.

The resolution for me is terrible. I always see all these complaints about he resolution of this machine, here is why the resolution is important. Real estate, the higher the resolution the more you can fit on your screen, I am a Web developer and I need to have many applications open at once and the resolution on this computer is awful for this kind of work.

"So I bought this Laptop in January, at the time it's features were unrivaled by any other vendor. One of the first I7 and 5 series gpu's lay before my eyes. I promptly sold the dualcore asus I bought in October for the same price and picked this one up and I must say it was well worth it. Dump the bloatware and this thing just what seems to be a limitless about of desktop processing power.

For single threaded apps it overclocks the clock speed to 2.8ghz, for multi-threaded it uses 1.6ghz two threads per core that works wonderfully in windows 7. As for the gpu I regret that I haven't put much on in the way of games, however I saw a notciable improvement in video playback on both it's led screen and my monitor colors just seem more vibrant and the playback is smoother I don't know if this is just because I haven't used an ati card in awhile or no. The only game I have tried was street fighter 4 everything on max with no AA left me with 60fps at the native laptop resolution.

As for the case and screen the the led screen is alright, the viewing angle isn't so good thought it is still backlit I would say my other screen was better in fact. As for the case all around the keyboard and keypad is rubber.. I don't honestly know how I feel about this yet, as for the plastic it's pretty chaep it's a good thing this thing comes with a accidental warranty because I have dropped it in the bag while reaching down for something and it left a mark. :-(

all in all you can't beat what this thing packages anywhere else. USB 3.0, I7 CPU, ati direct x 10 1gb gpu, 4gb ram upgradable to 8gb, bluetooth, wireless n. What more can you ask for?

"This is the first notebook I have purchased so maybe my experience (or lack of) is affecting my review.  One of the reasons I got it was to replace my older desktop, which the Asus does a great job at for a notebook.  It is larger than many other models an offers plenty of screen and key board space, it is quite at home on my desk.  But I also wanted the versatility of being able to travel with it, and if you don't mind lugging around close to ten pounds it does that as well.  The problem with going mobile is the battery life, you only get about 1.5 hours before the battery warning comes on.  I compromised this feature for all the other great features it does have: crisp, clear and large screen; blistering fast speed, great sound; solid build.  All in all it is a great notebook but not sure if it is worth the money at over $1000.00 with so many others available at far less, but again I haven't experienced them either so maybe not.  I am happy with mine and would recommend it to anyone that can afford it and is not looking for the best value neccessarily, just looking for the best.","['notebook purchase', 'experience lack', 'review reason', 'old desktop asus', 'great job notebook', 'large model', 'plenty screen key board space home desk', 'able travel mind lug', 'mobile battery life hour battery warning', 'clear large screen blister', 'fast speed', 'great notebook', 'sure worth money', 'good value']"
"Hi everyone. I bought this laptop on March 1, 2010. The first thing I did was max out the memory to 8gb. The i7 and the Mobility Radeon HD 5730 make this machine the beast it is. When I set out to buy a laptop back in 2010 I was looking for a desktop replacement that could run the Adobe Creative Suite and play games too. I work a lot in Photoshop, Indesign, After Effects and Premier Pro so I needed a beefy machine. Three years later and I'm still creating with zero glitches or lag using Adobe CS6.

Now about a year ago I did experience overheating on both the processor and video card which resulted in the laptop turning off. Note that the laptop always runs 8-10 hours a day in high performance. The symptoms appeared when I began playing Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. In response to the issue, I loaded GPU-Z and realtemp.exe and diagnosed it as overheating. I suspect that those other reviewers who have had video card failure experienced overheating. Now check this out. After I collected the overheating data I contacted Asus even though the laptop was out of warranty. I informed them of the situation and they promptly sent me a label to send in the laptop. I had the laptop back in two weeks. I'm not bothered by the overheating because Asus support is topnotch in my book. They've made me a brand loyal customer. I bought two of my kids Asus laptops for Christmas.

Anyway, if I had a complaint it is with the battery life. It died in its 13 month. In short, Asus stands behind there product and this product is rock solid in it's 3rd year.","['laptop march thing max memory gb mobility radeon hd machine beast', 'laptop look desktop replacement run adobe', 'creative suite play game work lot photoshop indesign', 'pro need beefy machine year', 'zero glitch', 'adobe cs year', 'experience overheat processor video card result laptop', 'note laptop run hour day high performance symptom', 'eld scrolls skyrim response issue load gpu realtemp exe diagnose', 'reviewer video card failure experience', 'datum contact asus laptop warranty', 'laptop laptop week bother', 'asus support topnotch book brand', 'loyal customer', 'kid asus laptop christmas complaint battery life', 'short asus stand product product rock', 'solid rd year']"
"Had this computer for a couple of months now. I am not really a techie, just an average user. Purchased this based from the good reviews here in Amazon. For the price alone, with a core i7 processor added with their warranty (which I hope I won't claim), no doubt that this is one of the most affordable units out there. It's not as stylish compared to others but looks are subjective, this unit appears to me, both elegant and contemporary. Besides, I didn'y buy this for it's looks but for it's power. Just read the specs and drool. It has a nice well-spaced chiclet keyboard(not lighted) which is comparative to a Vaio, lots of ports and connectors and the latest USB 3.0. Drawbacks that I encountered though which you will read also from other reviews are the low screen resolution which I really don't mind, besides that's what having an LED/LCD HDTV for; the vent on the side tends to get hot. I bought a fan for it though amazingly, the bottom part is cool; sensitive touch pad but I use an optical mouse so not really a concern. I suggest you buy an extra long lasting battery as this computer drains your battery fast especially when you are mobile.

"I ordered this laptop about a month ago and have been very impressed with both the performance and the look/feel of the notebook.  This is my first ASUS after bailing off of the HP bandwagon for the last few years.  The slim design and light weight package are very attractive.  The keyboard gives a nice resistance when typing (almost as if it has some kind of magical 'type-assist'#....as well as plenty of space between the keys.  The other comments regarding resolution are somewhat right, depending on what you're doing with it.  The Video Magic software from ASUS allows for enhancement for videos, and I've been impressed with the output.  The only disappointment would be if you do a lot of work in PS CS4...the resolution isn't the best for fine-tuning high-res photos.  Not really a big deal.

The only other downside is that my webcam is upside down.  Jeers to ASUS for not yet addressing this problem with this model on their website.  I used a 3rd Party workaround and it seems to work now #in most cases#.

Otherwise, great speed....loaded CS4 in under 30 minutes and it boots Photoshop CS4 in under 10 seconds, twice as fast as my duo core HP.

"As a Software Developer I was looking for something that was powerful and affordable. I need to be able to fire up a proper dev environment anywhere, without worrying about the pitfalls of laptops one usually gets at this price (they're really underpowered).

This laptop delivers on power. I can run multiple instances of Visual Studio 2010 with Sql Server running full steam, music in the background, office apps all over the place and this thing does not even blink. Incredible stuff.

However, it overheats bad. Real bad. If you're running those eight cores anywhere near their full potential then you are going to know all about it. If it's on your lap, you will want to take it off your lap with 10 minutes or so. If your left hand is near the exhaust where the heat is dispelled, you will want to move it quick-sticks.

Yes, this laptop heats up fast when you put it to good use, and this is unpleasant. Furthermore, when running full steam you don't expect it to go more 90 minutes or so. The battery life is pathetic. So much so that after only 2 weeks of using this pup, my Asus is now for sale.","['software developer look', 'powerful affordable need', 'able fire', 'proper dev environment', 'pitfall laptop', 'power run', 'multiple instance visual studio sql server run steam music background office app place thing blink', 'incredible stuff overheat', 'bad real bad run core', 'lap minute', 'exhaust heat dispel', 'yes laptop heat', 'fast good use', 'unpleasant furthermore run steam', 'minute battery life pathetic week pup asus sale']"
"Some people are blind (it IS brown. Not black. You have to hold it it bright light to see this however which is elegant in my opinion) and others are just plain stupid. This laptop is hands down awesome. It does run hot, but the i7 720qm thermal specification is 100c!!! Don't worry about it running in the mid 50's to 60's range. Just make sure you turn the power cord to the back or it sort of obstructs the fans; which are dead silent. I will be buying a cooler pad for this. It has a 2-3 hour battery life depending on your battery settings. But if you are buying this machine, you are aware that the components you're buying are not low power, economy parts. They are parts designed for making your life simple and easy with regard to your laptop. And they are very successful. Windows boots to idle extremely fast and NOTHING I have done so far has caused so much as a hiccup. Streaming Pandora, running UTorrent, up to 15 Firefox tabs running, pulling viedo files off my network and burning a dvd simultaneously? The 4 physical and 4 logical cores barely move. Feel free to check your email in the meantime. I would recommend reinstalling windows 7 with the disc to a single drive. You will have to reinstall the drivers and whatnot, but this is a very simple task. It eliminates the bloatware others have complained about. By the way, the bloatware didn't slow this thing down a hair the first time I booted her up. The touchpad is as good and better than any other. I did buy the wireless microsoft mouse and I also recommend it. Wireless N shows 150 mb/s for me and I get full signal with a netgear wndr3300 throughout my house.
The ONLY problem I could imagine, unless you're a tool and think not having xp is a problem, is that the screen can be glossy. Doesn't bother me though. Otherwise, plug the HDMI into a plasma 50 inch or something and watch the 5730 ati really tear it up! Pull the trigger....

"9-7-2013: This laptop is still perfect for Starcraft 2; except for the 4 Vs 4, but it is still playable. It is because of the Stream Processing and the mighty CPU. Starcraft only wants 6Ghz of the CPU. This laptop expresses massive stress if that you are using it for streaming your live games.

Asus will not answer you for any of your technical help.
_________________________

Well, I've personally gave it a solid state drive instead of a Hard drive. Upgraded it to the Windows 7 Ultimate, and the Asus compatible to it. the laptop comes with its 1 CD of drivers that'll cover everything in a single installation (it'll take about 20 minutes to install all everything from the mobo plug-in play).

The GPU feels like a 650Mhz core clock, making the 1GB of ram GPU extremely useless. The vid card is only strong enough to run on medium settings of your games such the Street Fighter 4, but stronger than the xbox360's ATI GPU. The Ultimate settings on Starcraft 2 demands 1GB of the GPU ram, but it no longer runs at 60fps but very poor performance. You'll want to stay at medium for its 60-fps at the very high resolutions. This laptop GPU doesn't have a logic with going faster fresh rate of frames at a smaller resolution, only at the highest HD resolutions it attends to go faster at 60fps medium settings. The Street Fighter 4 medium settings hits it beautifully at 60fps with only the use of the GPU ram of 136mb.

The CPU's FSB is a dream come true when it comes to the loading times with the solid state. It'll make the ram feels like 1666Mhz than it is originally 1066mhz. No needing to wait for a boot, truly instant.

Battery experience:
Without any heavier game application, it last 1 hours and 48 minutes. With the heavier game application it'll last 38 minutes.

Hm... The USB 3.0 isn't compatible with my Sprint on the road wireless G4 net speed, only the 2.0 on the other side of the laptop.

The CPU is a Bonifiede pro. There was nothing that I can do to stress it, putting my desktop to shame to put away from the last 3 weeks ago.","['perfect starcraft vs', 'playable stream processing', 'mighty cpu starcraft', 'ghz cpu laptop express', 'massive stress stream', 'game asus', 'technical help', 'solid state drive', 'hard drive upgrade windows', 'ultimate asus compatible laptop', 'cd driver', 'installation minute install mobo plug play gpu', 'mhz core clock', 'gb ram gpu', 'useless vid card', 'strong run medium setting game street fighter', 'strong xbox ati gpu', 'ultimate setting starcraft demand gb gpu ram', 'long run fps', 'poor performance', 'medium fps', 'resolution laptop gpu logic', 'fast fresh rate frame', 'small resolution high hd resolution', 'fast fps medium setting street fighter medium setting', 'gpu ram mb cpu fsb dream', 'solid state ram', 'mhz need', 'instant battery experience', 'heavy game application hour minute', 'heavy game application minute hm usb compatible sprint road wireless net speed laptop cpu bonifiede', 'pro stress', 'desktop shame']"
"Keyboard:
Chiclet keyboard feels nice, the large keys and a number pad are great! When I ordered this laptop I was worried I would get the UK keyboard layout with the large return key and the backslash key in a inconvenient location.  When I received the laptop I was pleased to find that it was the standard US keyboard layout with large enter, backspace, shift, and control keys which is a nice change from other laptop keyboards that have smaller keys.

Color:
The page says the color is dark brown but appears black under almost all conditions, a plus in my book.  I had to shine the back with an LED flashlight for it to appear brown.  I haven't taken outside in direct sunlight but it may appear more brown outside.

Build quality:
I would rate this a medium.  It shouldn't break under normal use but it doesn't look as sturdy as some others. Very bright white LEDs on both sides of the laptop blink when in standy mode or when powered on make the laptop distracting in a darker room.  I like the quiet fan volume.  Even the DVD drive is fairly quiet.  Screen hinges look nice and shouldn't break easily.

Performance:
Windows 7 boots fast!  Windows Experience Index of 5.9. Runs most all modern games on high quality.  Great performance for the price.

Ports:
Aside from the standard ports, this laptop has an HDMI port with audio out, one USB 3.0 connector, an eSATA connector!

Bundled software:
Comes with standard game demos, Office 2007 trial, and various ASUS utilities.  Nothing special but not nearly enough to be considered bloat-ware.  Comes with Windows 7 and driver re-install disc as well as recovery disc maker software.

Audio:
Great sound quality for laptop speakers. No noticeable distortion even at high volume!

Battery life:
Mediocre, I average about 2 hours in power saving mode.  But what do you expect from a gaming laptop with an i7 processor?  Get a netbook if you want battery life :)

Warranty:
Great warranty, came with one free year of accidental damage protection.","['keyboard chiclet keyboard', 'nice large key number', 'great order laptop', 'uk keyboard layout', 'large return key backslash key inconvenient location', 'standard keyboard layout', 'control key', 'laptop keyboard', 'small key color page', 'dark brown', 'black condition', 'book shine lead flashlight', 'direct sunlight', 'quality rate medium', 'normal use look sturdy', 'side laptop blink standy mode power laptop distract', 'dark room', 'quiet fan volume dvd drive', 'quiet screen hinge look', 'performance window boot', 'fast windows experience index run', 'modern game high quality', 'great performance price port', 'standard port laptop hdmi port audio usb connector esata connector', 'standard game demos office trial asus utility', 'bloat ware', 'windows driver install disc recovery disc maker software audio', 'great sound quality laptop speaker', 'noticeable distortion high volume battery life', 'mediocre average hour power', 'laptop processor netbook', 'battery life warranty', 'great warranty', 'free year accidental damage protection']"
"As an entertainment/all purpose laptop, this one is hard to beat even though it is becoming outdated.  Specs are widely available, and for all the number-crunchers there are all sorts of benchmarks available on the internet.  But to comment on some things that stand out during practical, everyday useage:
1. Battery life - Horrendous, but you would expect this when buying.  Power-saving measures help but don't hope for more than 2 hours unplugged in most usage situations.
2. No backlight on the keyboard - would certainly hurt point #1 even more, but the benefits would greatly outweigh the costs.
3. Heat - doesn't bother me at all as its rarely on my actual laptop.
4. Noise - super quiet laptop, you can barely hear the fan during normal use.
5. Overall performance - I've yet to find myself complaining about the computer being too slow.  I've done some fairly CPU-intensive work on this laptop and quite a bit of multi-tasking and it hasn't missed a beat.
6. USB 3.0 - spectacularly fast, a real genuine plus.
7. Bloatware - easily removed in a matter of minutes upon first receiving the laptop.
8. Weight - light enough for what it does, but no featherweight.  I carry it up and down stairs often, move it around the bed and the desk with no problems.  Its not bulky.
9. Keyboard and touchpad - keyboard takes some getting used to, but the full number pad is nice.  Multi-gesture touchpad works decently well but one of the greatest frustrations with this entire laptop is how sensitive/exposed the touchpad is to your palms accidently moving the mouse with the touchpad while typing.  I do not have huge hands, and it happens ALL THE TIME.  Very frustrating.","['entertainment purpose laptop', 'outdate spec', 'available number cruncher sort benchmark', 'available internet comment thing stand', 'practical everyday useage battery life horrendous', 'hope hour', 'usage situation backlight keyboard', 'hurt point benefit', 'outweigh cost heat bother', 'actual laptop noise', 'super quiet laptop', 'normal use overall performance', 'complain computer', 'cpu intensive work laptop bit multi', 'matter minute', 'laptop weight', 'light featherweight', 'stair bed desk problem', 'bulky keyboard touchpad keyboard', 'nice multi gesture touchpad work', 'great frustration', 'entire laptop', 'sensitive expose touchpad palm', 'mouse touchpad type', 'huge hand']"
"*update Aug 2013
New SSD is in (Crucial M4 256gb - blaaaazing fast) and usb fan is cooling it nicely. See pics in review for holes i drilled in bottom plastic (matching curve of the heatpipes) that enable better cooling :)

*update March 2013
Still going strong. Will be installing new hard drive soon, solid states dont last long, and I use it daily for several hours. Heat is still a major problem, I run everything at lower processor settings and still get overheating occasionally. Will be getting a fan soon, I'm thinking it needs some new thermal paste though, may try to see if I can reach the processor. Still performs faster than most computers I use!

*update* June 2012
Running a 128gb solid state drive now, with 8gb of memory....everything loads instantly! Laptop still in great condition... battery died within the 1st year though...runs fine plugged in and lasts 5min without plug! Hard drive also died...but thats a known problem that they ship with cheap drives...had to keep the costs down somewhere! I would get another or an updated version if this one dies though...fast for a latoptop!

Excellent laptop so far. I use it as a desktop replacement, and so far it has performed admirably!

"This Laptop is blazing fast and delivers as listed.  I use my laptop primarily for music production and daily internet usage but I also ran the Lost Coast HL2 stress test with everything (AA, reflections etc) maxed out and it was averaging well over 100fps.  Windows 7 compatibility has been a dream compared to the hassles I am used to with XP Home-- my FireWire 1814 box connects through a TI expresscard firewire adapter with no problems in Ableton Live.

The computer keyboard gets some getting used to if you are familiar with the Delete key being the top right-most key... as with all newer Asus laptops, they include a condensed numpad layout on the right side of the keyboard that adds the home/break/printscreen buttons up where I'm used to finding Del.  I think the benefits of having the numpad will outweigh this problem once I get used to it.

I read reviews stating that things like spread sheets were impossible to see on this computer because of the screen resolution... this is simply not true.  I formatted a book (spreadsheets involved!) and designed a book cover using this screen and it worked fine.  I do agree with people who have criticized the viewing angle of the screen though--At ordinary angles the image looks incredibly washed out and visibility is restricted to a tight range of screen positions for any given viewer--not ideal for watching movies on the laptop screen.

But!  With HDMI out, I plan to use an external monitor at some point and bypass all of the screen concerns entirely.

The computer removes heat VERY efficiently, but that means that anything in front of the vent on the left hand side will become very hot, so be careful! (i've melted one chapstick and one chocolate bar by placing them somewhere nearby during gameplay use).  Overall this computer just blows my mind.  I can alt-tab out of a game, start a music program, and open 10 chrome pages, all at the same time and it won't break a sweat.  For instance, the computer runs the dolphin emulator flawlessly on low settings (this is a pretty demanding emulator).

Anyways, I researched computers for a couple days straight and this one was by far the best deal i could find for under $1000.  Buy this right now if you are even slightly interested!  Hah, WORD OF WARNING:  Amazon shipped my latptop in its original Asus box with pictures and specs of the laptop all over it--I would recommend selecting gift wrapping if you don't want people knowing that a valuable product is inside.

"I purchased and returned this unit just today after receiving it from Amazon only yesterday.
It is of high quality equal to the more widely known MFGs.
I had to return it due to the lack of resolution, razor thin viewing angle and meaningless Gamma Ctrl from its 768 screen.
I'm coming from a 5 year old Gateway 1600*900 M65 Core 2 Laptop with a Go Force 7800. And YES I knew the specs going in and took a chance but well you can't fight the numbers sometimes.
 Yes, the older LT display is significantly better. Much darker blacks, hence better contrast. Phillip/LG made the screens for the Gateway back when and they are excellent, near Plasma black levels I dare say. Now granted the Gateway is a 17"" 900 screen where the ASUS is only 15.6 /768 but if you are using Adobe/Lightroom or Nikon Capture NX2 you will be disappointed","['purchase return unit', 'high quality', 'mfg return lack resolution razor', 'thin view angle', 'meaningless gamma ctrl screen', 'old gateway core laptop force yes', 'chance fight number yes', 'old lt display', 'contrast phillip lg screen gateway', 'black level dare grant gateway screen asus adobe lightroom nikon', 'nx disappoint']"
"I've had this computer for about a year now, so I can offer a review here without the bias of that initial haze of excitement.

Pros:
-The technical specs are good. I'm not a hardcore gamer, but I've been able to run everything I've wanted to run smoothly except GTAIV (but performance-wise, that game is broken anyways), including WoW, The Sims 3, Civilization V, and the Total War series, all on high settings. Light modeling and Photoshop also ran with no issues.

I've listed a lot more cons than pros, but keep in mind that the pro is an important one.

Cons:
-If you use this computer on your lap, it runs uncomfortably hot. I mean it.
-The power cord comes off very easily. Moving it around almost ensures that it will fall out. Again, if you use this on your lap, I guarantee it's going to go unplugged unnoticed at least once.
-Gets dirty easily.
-The screen seems to make contact with the keyboard when the lid closes, so the grime from the keyboard occasionally gets on the screen.
-Not recommended if you are the sweaty palm type. Heat + prone to grime + sweaty palms = very, very bad. I'm constantly cleaning the area to the left of the touchpad where my palm rests because it's constantly gross. I never had such an issue with my other laptops.
-Too big to frequently carry around (I'm a college student). I had to offset this by purchasing a netbook.

As neither a pro or a con, it makes a moderate amount of noise. It does get noticeable while gaming.

In the end, I'd recommend this computer if you're only in it for the specs and the price. As for me, I wish I would have looked more into other factors, like size, heat, and comfort before making my purchase. It runs everything I need to, but it's uncomfortably large, hot, and dirty. Take this as you will; it would probably be fine if it just sat on a desk.","['computer year', 'review bias', 'initial haze excitement', 'technical spec good hardcore gamer', 'able run', 'gtaiv performance wise game', 'wow sims civilization total war series high setting', 'photoshop run issue list lot', 'con pro mind', 'computer lap run', 'power cord', 'ensure fall use lap', 'screen contact keyboard lid', 'close grime keyboard', 'sweaty palm type heat', 'prone grime sweaty palm', 'clean area', 'touchpad palm rest', 'gross issue laptop', 'college student offset purchase netbook', 'moderate noise', 'computer spec price', 'size heat comfort', 'purchase run need', 'large hot dirty']"
"I bought this 16 months ago for my daughter who was going off to graduate school. Within a couple of weeks she was complaining that it ran very hot and had very poor battery life. A few weeks after that the hard drive began to make funny sounds and then the computer would not boot. Tech support at ASUS said that she should send the computer in for service and that the turnaround would be more than a week. She did not have the luxury of not having a computer for that length of time as much of the course material was being presented online. She goes to school three hours away, so I drove to her school and switched out her computer for an older laptop that I had. I ordered a new hard drive, installed it and restored the computer to its original state, and I thought that was the end of it. But a few weeks later, the computer was freezing multiple times a day, and she had to reboot each time. She then informed me that she was so frustrated that she bought a MAC!
I updated the drivers and removed all the software except the OS and it no longer ""froze"""".

"I am a 31 yr old female and had a 3 yr old Dell laptop I was looking to replace that was super slow and froze on me constantly.  I've had this for a month. I am not computer savvy but needed a laptop for my classic ipod collection, connecting remotely to work, and various things like Microsoft office and tons of time in the internet.  I am not a gamer but figured a gaming computer would give me the power and speed I wanted.  I went strictly by ratings on Amazon.  I'm not disappointed by the computer. It's great because it is new and obviously faster.

Like other reviewers have said, yes, the computer looks black to me not brown.  Only upon close inspection in the sunlight can you see there is a bit of brown.  Also This does NOT come with anything but a trial of Microsoft Office-you will need to buy word, excel  etc since there is no alternative like Microsoft works on the computer.

Pros:
Love the ten key on the side. This is a must for me.
Like the touch sensor where you can scroll and zoom; it was easy to learn.
Good size monitor but not too big.
Love windows 7 which I find very intuitive.
Love there is tech support included from Asus.
Computer keyboards seems a little more enclosed making it tougher for crud to get under keys.

Cons:
Though not bad, it's not the nicest looking computer. Toshiba and Sony are going to look and ergonomically feel better though you won't get as high of ratings overall with those.
This does NOT come with anything but a trial of Microsoft Office-you will need to buy word, excel  etc since there is no alternative like Microsoft works on the computer.
Though I love the touch sensor that you can scroll and zoom with your fingers I still find it easier to use a mouse.
Computer gets hot-you need a cooling pad for sure. Hardly a con for me though-has not slowed me down.

"Had to push one of the back panels in so it was seated properly.
There is a tiny gap in the casing by the media reader slot - it is barely noticeable, and I assume it's another part that is just not pushed in all the way like the back piece was.
There is a tiny amount of keyboard flex, but when you're typing you don't notice it - only if you're looking for it/pressing down deliberately hard.
Coming from a mac laptop, the multi-finger gestures aren't as bad as I've read - they seem to work just fine so far (after you know what the gestures are - they aren't all extremely intuitive) After a few days of use I notice it works only sometimes - anyone know whats up with that? If you're getting this laptop I wouldn't count on this feature.
It feels surprisingly light.
The hinge is sturdy - i expect it to last.
The sound: I can see both opinions - it can sound tinny - but it's also... guess what? A laptop. And no, there isn't cell phones with better speakers - although i've seen some that are pretty close to this. There just isn't any lows, and barely any mids - if you really want good sound, ignore the hype Asus created in their advertisement of these speakers (all that's really exciting about it is that the normal laptop speakers are arranged in some special way-and it comes with some tuning software) and get a pair of some decent desktop speakers. Don't expect any miracles with the sound. That being said, the built-ins are decent laptop speakers (the stereo effect will certainly surprise you). & They are plenty louder than my Macbook's built-ins - so i'm not disappointed with it. The sound required some minor tweaking in the SRS software to get it to my liking.
The hand rest is a fingerprint magnet, I can tell it's going to be difficult to keep clean - the fingerprints go on, but they don't wipe off as easy as if it were a gloss plastic.
The back, indeed looks black. It's pretty & understated.
There isn't a terrible amount of bloat-ware.. I uninstalled all of the game trials and a few other programs and that was all i had to do.
It's pretty thin for a laptop this size - not fat looking like those terrible HPs
Mine came with 1333 ram.
I created a backup DVD set when i got the laptop - and that took about 2 hours (compressing the files, creating an iso, and burning 4 discs) with the supplied backup software.
I haven't run down the battery yet - but it says about 1.5 hours.
The video card is...awesome. I ran Battlefield Bad Company 2 (a DX11 game) on all of the highest settings (8x anti-aliasing, highest resolution etc.) And it ran perfectly except for a bit of slow down during massive explosions etc. - but, when the anti-aliasing is turned down to 4x it runs just fine.
I was planning on getting an X25M SSD for this laptop - but...It doesn't really need it! Boots up in seconds... Photoshop opens in about 4-5 seconds...
I saw today that apple revamped their macbook & MBPs - and after looking at them - I would still buy this laptop. It's $1,800 cheaper... And the hardware is still better.

"When I first got this computer back in '10, it was awesome. It didn't last very long on battery power, but hey, that's what you get with a dedicated graphics card and a i7 processor. It did everything flawlessly, it was fast, and it played my games like a champ. Street Fighter IV and StarCraft II ran perfectly on the machine.

After about a year, after the warranty was up, the problems started happening. It would overheat like crazy. If you put your finger on the part of the keyboard above the vent, it would start to burn. Then it started to shut down while playing games. While initially I had StarCraft II on high settings, I had to put it down to the lowest possible settings to even play the game. After a while, this didn't even help, the laptop still shut down. Then I had tried a cooling pad under the laptop, that didn't help at all. I installed a temperature program on the laptop and it showed that the CPU and GPU would go to 210+ degrees F when playing games, and stay at 190+ while browsing the web. I can't even play a HD video on my laptop without it shutting down now. If I watch Netflix, I have to watch in low resolution and not HD because it'll stutter and the audio and video gets out of sync.

I finally found a fix, a small tabletop fan pointed at the vent would cool it down enough that I could play my games without the computer shutting down on me. Unfortunately, this fan is also pointing directly at my fingers, so it gets hard to type -- especially in the winter. The fan has to be on almost constantly now, otherwise the computer WILL overheat and shut down.

I called Asus technical support, they were wonderfully unhelpful. They wanted me to update the BIOS, I did and that didn't help one bit.

And just a week ago, my HDD crashed. I still have no idea why. The computer just wouldn't recognize that a HDD was inserted at all. So I had to get a new one. And so it definitely wasn't a software related issue, the computer is still overheating.

I called Asus again, and they said that the only thing I could do was to send it in for repairs. I'm out of warranty, so it's going to cost me. I can't even get an upfront estimate of the cost, the guy said that they would call me and tell me after they checked it out. So I have to spend the money to send it in and wait probably a month to get a call, just for an estimate of the repair price.

This isn't just my laptop too, my cousin has an Asus laptop and he has the same exact problem with his. I think Asus used to be a reliable brand, it seems they've started to use extremely unreliable and cheap parts for their laptops. I also have a Asus netbook that is a 400 dollar paperweight.

"First of all, I have to say that the product itself has good specs for a good price.  This is what drew me to this particular product.

When I received it, I immdediately removed all the bloatware and it was a very fast and responsive machine.

However, 2 things stand out when you receive the machine:

-the machine feels constructed of flimsy, cheap plastic

-the screen is garbage.  I was expecting a low resolution (way too low for a 16"" screen)","['product good spec good price', 'particular product', 'fast responsive machine thing stand', 'construct flimsy', 'cheap plastic', 'screen garbage', 'low resolution way', 'low screen']"
"Ok so I just got this notebook about a week ago and I had it up and running in no time. My first impression of it is that the color is better than described on amazon. Like others said, it's a very dark brown that can easily pass for black. The screen and the back are a huge fingerprint magnet though. If you are a neat freak like I am, this may be a little problem. I literally clean the screen every 5 minutes ( not that bad though cause i kinda actually like cleaning it :D).

All that aside, this thing is very fast. I had no problems running multiple programs and graphics intensive games at the same time. BTW, i'm not a gamer or anything and haven't tested a lot of games on it but this plays Sims 3 well. There is a lot of initial bloatware installed on this thing, but I actually decided to keep most of it as this notebook could handle it anyway and most of them were not that bad.

Now it's time to get to my big complaint. For those of you who don't know, this notebook comes preinstalled with 3 partitions. 1 is the Recovery, about 16gb. 2 is the OS(main) about 75 gb and the 3rd was Data with about 200 something gb. I REALLY HATED THIS! Within my first week of using this my OS was just about out of space, so I decided to do what I should have done when I first got it, which was to do a clean install and re-partition the hard drive. I backed up all my data and used the asus built in recovery (F9) procedure. Everything went fine until the process was completed and it told me to shut down. When I tried to start it back up, THE SCREEN WOULD NOT COME ON. Nothing I did worked so I had to call ASUS tech line. I must admit that the service was fast and easy. They told me I would have to send it back for service. I'm in the process of sending this back now.

Although my little mishap, I still recommend this notebook. I think my problem was random. Maybe just a bad recovery procedure or something. My advice to new owners is to burn the back up cd's and just use those if you want to re partition the drive.

When I get this back, I'll update on my experience with ASUS tech service and any other thing I can think of.","['notebook week', 'time impression color', 'describe amazon', 'dark brown', 'black screen', 'huge fingerprint magnet neat freak', 'clean screen minute', 'fast problem run', 'multiple program graphic intensive game time btw gamer test lot game play sims lot', 'initial bloatware instal thing', 'bad time', 'big complaint', 'preinstalle partition recovery gb os', 'main gb rd data gb', 'week os space', 'clean install partition', 'hard drive', 'datum asus', 'recovery procedure', 'fine process', 'work asus tech line', 'service process', 'problem random', 'bad recovery procedure advice', 'new owner burn cd use', 'partition drive update experience asus tech service thing']"
"I have had this computer for almost a month before I wrote this review so i could give you all a good review. This laptop is awesome. I am very happy that I purchased this laptop. It is very fast everything runs great on this machine. This is my first Asus laptop and I am so so so happy I purchased it. I am a big gammer so all of the games I have played have worked without any problems on high settings. I play mostly MMORPG type games, so I have played WOW, ROM, Atlantica, and soon Star Craft 2, every game I have thrown at this computer it has worked without a problem.  I also run alot of programs because I am currently in school so I have alot of applications open, and I have my browser open with prob over 20 + tabs, and I have multiple games running in the background along with my Norton working in the background and other background services and this thing DOES NOT SKIP A BEAT. With all that going on I haven't seen this computer over-clock it self yet so its well worth getting the Asus i7 series laptops. The volume is great on some things and others its pretty crappy, the screen is awesome I am not sure what everyone is complaining about because it looks great to me. The keyboard is a chicklet type keyboard but I love it, it doesn't flex on the left side well not on my computer so I am not sure where people are getting that from either, but then again I don't type really hard, I am very fast lite typer, but I have typed hard to see if it flexes and it doesn't so maybe its just their computer. Some people are complaining that there is not a backlight on the keyboard, well all I have to say about that is it would be nice but I type without looking at the keyboard so it really doesn't matter to me.

Now the only bad thing I have to say is the laptop is a finger print magnet and a dust magnet because I am always cleaning this beast LOL. The color is a very dark dark brown and you can't tell it is a brown color unless its under direct light but it doesn't bother me because it looks very professional and I like that. It does get a little hot on the left hand side but the fan does a good job keeping it cool. I did buy a laptop cooler but I don't think it really needs it but I use it anyways and it keeps it pretty cool, but this a laptop after all with alot of power so what can you expect it will get hot sometimes! Over all this is a great computer for just the causal user or for someone who needs alot of power. If you can get this computer when its on sale then grab it, even if you can't the price amazon is offering for this computer is still wonderful because I did alot of research and you can't get this much power with this size screen with any other computer or for the same computer from a different company its more expensive. I had doubts about buying this computer at first and after doing alot of research at least a week worth of research reading reviews and all sorts of thing and I still found that this is a freakin awesome computer from an awesome company. If your a gammer then get this beast it will handle all your games, if you need power for other things and software then this is the computer for you. Like it says its an entertainment laptop I have viewed HD movies on here and it is so amazing, I use headphones ofcourse so the sound comes across great, im a computer geek and very picky so if i suggest this computer to other people then its good. Just Buy It.","['computer month', 'review good review laptop awesome', 'happy purchase laptop', 'fast run', 'great machine asus laptop', 'happy purchase', 'big gammer game play work problem high setting play mmorpg type game play wow rom atlantica', 'star craft game', 'computer work problem run alot program', 'school alot application', 'open browser', 'open prob tab', 'multiple game run background norton work background background service thing', 'computer clock self', 'asus series laptop volume', 'great thing', 'pretty crappy screen awesome', 'sure complain look', 'great keyboard chicklet type keyboard', 'sure people', 'hard fast lite typer type', 'computer people complain backlight keyboard', 'nice type look keyboard matter', 'bad thing laptop finger print magnet dust magnet', 'clean beast lol color', 'dark dark brown', 'brown color', 'direct light bother look', 'hand fan good job', 'laptop cooler', 'need use anyways', 'pretty cool laptop alot power', 'hot great computer causal user need alot power computer sale', 'price amazon', 'wonderful alot research power size screen computer computer', 'different company', 'expensive doubt', 'computer alot research week', 'worth research reading review sort thing', 'freakin awesome computer awesome company gammer beast', 'game need power thing software computer', 'entertainment laptop view hd movie', 'amazing use headphone ofcourse', 'great computer geek picky', 'computer people']"
"I gave this computer 3-stars because it does what I need it to do and the technical specs are pretty good. Not great for the price, but good.

Pros: has great sound, which is important to me. the SRS Premium Sound panel takes alot of playing with to get a good sound with whatever speakers you are using. I normally hate laptops mostly cause the mouse pads, but they copied Apple (in a good way) and made it so you can use 2 fingers anywhere on the pad and scroll instead of having a scroll bar on the side or whatever. I've found myself using other laptops and being confused by their lack of convenience. USB 3.0 makes transferring all my data alot easier and my phone and ipod charges super quick when i use the usb cable.

Cons: only a few days after the 30-day zero bright dot warranty expired i found a few dead pixels, that strangely seem to come and go. the entire thing is very flimsy; the keyboard depresses quite a bit when typing and the screen flexes as if nothing is behind the screen giving it support. it comes with a TON of preloaded games and Asus software, some of which im afraid to uninstall for fear of messing up the OS or BIOS. Pay attention to where your pictures and music and things are saved, as the default path leads to the smaller ""OS"""" partition and it will fill up very quickly. The mouse gets annoying and worn out fairly quick. Even with trying to adjust the sensitivity it either grabs on to an internet tab or something and wont let go or it has a hard time double clicking. The webcam is less than 1 mp","['computer star need', 'technical spec', 'pretty good great price good', 'pro great sound important srs premium', 'sound panel', 'alot play good', 'sound speaker', 'copy apple good way use finger', 'laptop confuse lack convenience usb', 'datum alot', 'easy phone ipod charge', 'super quick use usb cable', 'con day day zero', 'bright dot warranty', 'dead pixel', 'entire thing flimsy keyboard depress bit type screen', 'game asus software', 'afraid uninstall', 'mess os bios', 'attention picture music thing', 'default path lead', 'small os partition', 'internet tab', 'time double', 'webcam mp']"
"Yep! I named it! lol. I also watched the advertisement video of the first generation of core i... processors. Wow...nostalgic
The N61JQ-X1 did give me my first BSOD as well as the yellow/blue squares *for me* before I crashed just about 3 months or so after i purchased it in april 2010. However, what I quickly realized is that those crashes were also due to the laptop's heat, and i'm sure you know what i'm talking about. I live in the Caribbean so I can definitely testify about the laptop's heat generation. About a year or so though, after trying to combat this problem by directing a fan to it *since my room doesnt' have AC unlike the computer lab when I was in high school*, this wasnt' going to work anymore. Afte putting it on, I noticed through some temp monitors that my processor and gpu were reading about..80 to 90 degrees (celcius) on regular/idle states, and the room temperature for me here was/is about 30 degrees during the day. I tried applying thermal paste *arctic silver* to the cpu and gpu, but, I didn't notice any drastic change -- only by about 2 degrees. So yeah, about...6 months from this post, I decided to start eliminating the temperature spike by removing the back panel and, it's dropped by 20 degrees now. Oh and I was using the cooler from the time I got the laptop by the way. However, despite all these problems, I'm still impressed by the laptop. I can even run Crysis 3! Back in the day, I could've run Gears of war, Resident Evil 5, Call of Duty  MW2 on max settings. Lol. It takes your back. But this baby isnt' out yet and isnt' close to that.

I'm not sure why others have experienced worse problems such as the loss of their fans etc., but I guess I was one of the fortunate one to notice how to counteract this heat problem a bit quickly. Currently, I have windows 8 instaleld on it, 64 bit, *pro version* and it's running quiite smoothly. No problems, except of course, the heat, and this darn webcam problem I've experienced since 2011, where it keeps telling me that another program is using it etc. and yeah, I've tried a lot to fix this issue.

But the point is, I'm quite pleased with this laptop. It's given me sooo much service, and I'll continue to use it happily, just not as continuously now, as I've been using it literally for at least 8 hours every day since 2010. It's amazing to see how far we've reached in just 3 years, since this laptop uses about 34% more power than the average laptop at the moment.

http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/2RNKFQSJQDVX2/ref=topnav_lists_1

This is the rig I'm building and I shall be building it when the rest of the parts come a few days after I post this. I've moved onto the desktop stage, and perhaps next year, I'll go with Asus again, but this time, with the haswell processor and perhaps the maxwell gpu. However, I'll go with less rigorous specs.

But overall, I'm quite pleased with this laptop, and I thank Asus for designing this. It's served me well in its.

"I had the experience of working with two of these N61s. The first was exchanged due to what appeared to be a hardware failure, or hardware in the process of failing. On three occasions the computer suddenly lost power. All power. Which appeared linked to the use of the supper USB port on the left hand side of the machine, as two of the outages occurred subsequent to its use. The second machine did not experience this problem.

As well, there were two issues with the display on both machines, one of which could have been adequately addressed had tech support been on the ball. The other had to do with very poor color rendering. Both machines had a very strong blue hue that was difficult to get rid of.  As well the black levels were just poor, and the screen was a dust magnet. As to the reference to Asus tech support. I tried vigorously to implement my own color management profile, but neither comp would retain my color settings profile when emerging from sleep or hibernation, and sometimes from off. This as it turns out is a Windows 7 issue, not Assus. But their tech support apparently were not aware and futiley tried to solve it . So this added to my frustration, as i assumed it was an Assus issue. With the Sony I have now, I have since created a sufficient work around to bring up my color settings. Had I known this at the time, I may have kept the second machine.

Color management issues aside, the distinct blue hue was less pronounced with the replacement machine and after a system reinstall, as suggested by Assus tech support, I got an ok picture.  The first machine was just too poor.

Other than these issues, the display is a dust magnet, the resolution needs to be higher and the black levels need to be improved. As well, the keyboard could have been a bit more solid. And then there was the side lights that all together could have and should have been done with out.

On the positive side. The computer itself seemed pretty awesome. It was very quick with startup, running office, firefox and looking at videos, sometimes all at once. And it ran cool and quiet.  I also liked the rubber skin, was a nice addition.

As I stated, had tech support been more on the ball, I may have kept the machine.  The black levels and lower resolution didn't bother me so much as it did my tech savy friend.  The dust may have become annoying over time.  But the computer itself seemed pretty great.

Looses one star for the display issues and another for the poor tech support, poor quality of the first machine and the other minor negatives.","['experience work exchange', 'hardware failure hardware process', 'occasion computer', 'power power', 'link use supper usb port', 'hand machine outage', 'subsequent use', 'machine experience problem issue display machine', 'address tech support ball', 'poor color', 'strong blue hue', 'difficult rid black level', 'poor screen dust magnet reference asus tech support', 'color management profile comp', 'color setting profile', 'sleep hibernation', 'windows issue assus tech support', 'aware futiley', 'assus issue sony', 'sufficient work', 'color setting', 'machine color management issue', 'blue hue', 'replacement machine system reinstall', 'assus tech support', 'ok picture machine', 'poor issue display dust magnet resolution need high', 'black level need', 'keyboard bit', 'solid light', 'positive computer', 'pretty awesome', 'quick startup run office firefox look video run', 'rubber skin', 'nice addition state tech support ball', 'black level', 'low resolution bother tech savy friend dust', 'time computer', 'pretty great loose star display issue', 'poor tech support', 'poor quality machine']"
"I was excited to get my hands on this laptop after I had read all the customer reviews on amazon that indicated how much of a steal this product was. But after using this laptop for about a month, I am slightly disappointed with some of its features.

The build quality of the laptop is not that great. It feels as if I were to drop it just three feet from the ground, the laptop would cease to function. I was taken aback by this, as my previous toshiba laptop was $400 dollar cheaper than this laptop but was much sturdier. Another low point of the laptop is that the speakers are awful, just plain awful. I still do not understand why asus decided to use such cheap sounding speakers in such an expensive laptop. There is absolutely no bass in it. The build quality is easy to forgive because if you handle your laptop carefully, it should not suffer any kind of damage. But the speakers are something that every owner of the laptop would utilize in their day to day activities. Why did asus decided to cut their corners on this? I would have gladly paid additional $50 if the onboard speakers were of higher quality.

other than my above mentioned grievances, the laptop is good for what it is. The i7 cpu and ATI 5730 GPU allow for laptop to function smoothly. As other users have mentioned, there is a fair amount of bloatware when you first boot it up. The following guide helped me a lot in getting rid of all the bloatware: [...]

I played splinter cell conviction and dragon age origins on this machine and both games ran smoothly on medium to high settings. The laptop does heat up a fair amount when you are playing games but that is to be expected. The laptop also features multi touch touchpad and since this is my first time using a touchpad of this kind, I found the experience to be amazing. The laptop also features a single usb 3.0 port but I don't own any devices with usb 3.0 connectors; so that's that. The keyboard is not full sized but in the last month I have gotten used to placement of all the buttons. It's not amazing but not a deal breaker either. The battery life is about 2 hours and you can stretch it to 3 hours by dimming down the screen brightness and switching devices like bluetooth off.

I am giving this product 3 stars because from a hardware standpoint, there is no other laptop out right now that can match this one at the same price point. Plus, other companies charge at least additional $100 for the warranty plan that asus gives on this laptop for free. I really wish that this laptop had better speakers because then this laptop would have been perfect.","['hand laptop', 'customer review amazon', 'product laptop month', 'quality laptop', 'drop foot ground laptop', 'previous toshiba laptop dollar', 'cheap laptop sturdy', 'low point laptop speaker awful', 'plain awful', 'cheap sound speaker', 'expensive laptop', 'suffer kind damage speaker owner laptop utilize day day activity asus', 'additional onboard speaker high quality', 'grievance laptop good cpu ati gpu', 'laptop function', 'fair bloatware boot', 'rid bloatware play splinter cell conviction dragon age origin machine game run', 'medium high setting laptop heat fair play game', 'multi touch touchpad time touchpad kind', 'amazing laptop', 'usb port device usb connector keyboard', 'placement button', 'breaker battery life hour', 'hour dim screen brightness switch device', 'product star hardware standpoint laptop', 'price point', 'company charge', 'additional warranty plan asus', 'free wish laptop', 'speaker laptop']"
"After a very bad experience with an Asus N10Jh-A1 and due to Asus having a good reputation for laptops- a second unit was tried, the N61Jq-X1 (A1 is same except for having 2 year warranty).  Amazon has changed it's ad for this laptop since our company purchased this unit, as it does not have the TV grade, additional amplifier and cone speakers etc, which was advertised.  Asus website still has these features listed, including a really nice video touting their laptop.  Simply doesn't exist on N61Jq units.

Turned the laptop on for the first time, providing name /date/time, password and reached the create the System Restore DVD's (four required)part of setup. Inserted first new DVD disc and a half hour later, this laptop Blue Screened, BSOD, on SETUP.  When finally back at the point of doing the Restore discs for second time, the second attempt to do Disc #1, few minutes later another error box and BSOD again.  This is going well. Now on third attempt to do Disc #1 which started at 26% ?? and later, FOUR hours later, the four dvd backup discs are finished.  Don't expect I could trust these discs to Restore anything.  Day Two: ASUS was sent all the technical stuff (codes and information beyond my technical expertise, hoping only to provide Asus with information to fix the problem, OR be able to find out it's not repairable, information easily found using Windows 7 which I believe is the best thing Microsoft has done in some time and gasp! might even be better than XP.  Four separate emails and tech numbers from Asus later, the Asus techs are still talking about SRS drivers and issues nothing to do with BSOD.  Since initial setup, the unit in the past three weeks BSOD two more times while watching two movies from internet.  Interesting only for having nothing to do with DVD drive in unit.  The N61Jq-X1 as of yesterday is on it's way back to Amazon.  Going to purchase a Sony VPC-F111FX/H  or if Amazon takes forty days to credit the N61 like they did the N10, will order one directly from Sony.
<Note, clarify previous remark: Amazon is normally very good at returns and taking care of customers problems, and Amazon is a vendor our company will pay a  little more to buy from Amazon due to this customer service.  Everyone will have a bad day, so I wanted to be fair and temper the remark made here with additional facts.  In the big universe of vendors wanting your money, you'd be hard pressed to find a company doing better by their customers than Amazon.  Dillon Precision is one, they're out there, but the bar is up high.>

It is likely in the universe of all the laptops which Asus produces that a couple of 'lemons' will come from their factory.  Have two big issues with ASUS,  First is their Tech Service from two different laptop, our experiences with ASUS Tech department in the past six months is deplorable.  Second, I have a real BIG problem when a manufacturer touts features and hardware that is NOT actually in the laptop.  Go to Asus home website  asutech or [...],, go to Products, to Laptops, Multimedia units, then click on N61, then click on N61Jq  or any N61J  code,, look at the Sound System you should have,  Watch Asus video...THE SOUND SYSTEM, SPEAKERS/AMPLIFIER ETC. JUST ISN'T THERE.  AMAZON IS CURRENTLY CHANGING SEVERAL WEBSITES ADS SINCE THE INFORMATION ASUS FURNISHED THEM WAS WRONG.  INDEFENSIBLE TO SELL A PRODUCT WHICH FALSELY DESCRIBES THE HARDWARE THE CUSTOMER IS EXPECTING TO RECEIVE FOR HIS MONEY.

"I bought this computer as a replacement for a Macbook with a 2.0 Ghz Core Duo, which was really starting to show its age. Boy did I get my money's worth.

Pros:
-Chiclet keyboard, my preferred keyboard style.
-i7 processor. I can run everything my heart desires and this computer doesn't skip a beat.
-Radeon 5730. I finally got a chance to play Portal on a computer (my Macbook wouldn't even run it). Nearly every setting is maxed out on the recommended settings, and those that aren't maxed out are only a notch down. Same with Left 4 Dead 2. This is quite an experience for someone who is used to console gaming.
-Wireless is 802.11n and my laptop DOES have Bluetooth support. I picked my computer up when it jumped from $909 to $958, under the assumption that this model still didn't have Bluetooth, only to discover that I DO in fact have it. Perhaps that's why the bumped the price.
-USB 3.0 port. I use it for my wireless mouse receiver right now, but it's nice to have a bit of future proofing here. I'll have USB 3.0 when devices start to use it.
-Touchpad. I really like the touchpad on this laptop (I have an Asus netbook that has a similar pad). I turn off all functionality beyond 1 tap clicking, 2 finger scrolling, and 2 finger left click. Works great.
-Dedicated volume buttons! About an inch above the F# keys, there are mute, volume down, and volume up buttons. They're a nice addition, I'd rather have them than have to use Fn + F10/11/12.
-Number pad. Totally irrelevant to me, but probably useful to some folks. Might as well toss them in there, since the screen is so big.
-Speaking of, THE SCREEN! It's gorgeous. I did some tinkering with it, at default settings the screen is a bit washed out, but the Win7 display calibrator got the job done, and everything looks right now.
-All sorts of ports. Built in SD card slot, E-Sata, hdmi out, vga out, and two more USB 2.0 ports. More than enough for me!
-The inner body is rubberized! Very nice to touch and rest my wrists on while typing. A really nice touch, in my opinion.
-The speakers are actually quite decent. I rarely feel the desire to put on headphones while playing a game or watching something, the speakers can easily fill a small to medium sized room with a fan in the background. They beat the crap out of the wimpy speakers in my Macbook.

Cons:
-Bloatware! I deleted a ton of stuff right off the bat, and I feel like I have more to delete. I had over 30 GB of space taken up on my HDD before I even used the laptop!
-While playing a game like L4D2 or Portal, the fan on the left side of the laptop is an absolute heat wave. I had a bottle of Axe sitting next to the fan the first time I loaded up Portal, and after around a half hour of sitting in the fan's jetstream, the can was nearly scalding. I can deal with it (and to be honest, the heat could be worse considering the punch that this laptop packs), but just be aware of it. I no longer have anything sitting to the left of this laptop on my desk.
-Battery life. Again, to be expected, but at max settings, Win7 tells me to expect between an hour and a half to two hours at full charge. I don't exactly travel with this though, so I'm over it.
-Initial drive partitions. I have no idea why Asus likes to partition its laptop/netbook HDDs right off the bat, but they did the same thing with my netbook and now this laptop too. The C drive was set to 75 GB and the other drive was 200 something GB. I just merged the partitions back together with the built in Win7 tools, and now I'm back to one partition.

I had my eye on desktop replacement laptops for about two months before I finally felt ok to pull the trigger on this one, and I don't regret my decision one bit. The only thing missing from this computer is a Blu Ray drive, but I felt that I wouldn't really use it much (I have a PS3). This laptop is every bit as good spec-wise as every other laptop in my price range (1000-1300), and it's sub $1000! I can't find a deal breaker here. If you have the money and want a reasonably priced desktop replacement laptop, this one should be near the top of your list.","['computer replacement macbook ghz core duo', 'age boy money', 'worth pro chiclet keyboard', 'keyboard style processor run heart desire computer', 'chance play portal computer macbook run', 'setting maxe', 'setting maxe notch', 'dead experience console', 'wireless laptop bluetooth support', 'assumption model bluetooth', 'fact bump price usb port use wireless mouse receiver', 'nice bit', 'future proof usb device', 'touchpad laptop asus netbook', 'functionality tap', 'click work', 'great dedicate volume button inch key mute volume volume button', 'nice addition use fn number', 'useful folk', 'big speaking screen gorgeous', 'default setting screen bit', 'display calibrator', 'job look', 'sort port', 'sd card slot sata hdmi vga usb port', 'inner body rubberize', 'nice touch rest wrist type', 'nice touch opinion', 'desire headphone play game', 'small medium', 'room fan background', 'crap wimpy speaker macbook', 'con bloatware delete ton stuff', 'delete gb space', 'hdd laptop', 'portal fan', 'absolute heat wave bottle axe', 'fan time load portal', 'fan jetstream', 'honest heat', 'punch laptop pack', 'laptop desk battery life', 'max setting', 'hour charge', 'initial drive partition idea asus', 'partition laptop netbook hdds', 'right bat thing netbook laptop drive', 'gb drive gb', 'tool partition eye desktop replacement laptop month', 'ok pull trigger regret decision bit thing', 'computer blu ray drive', 'ps laptop bit good spec wise laptop price range sub', 'breaker money', 'price desktop replacement laptop']"
"I purchased this system for the dual purpose of gaming on-the-go, as well as having a mobile software development platform. As a college student, having my own system to tote around is far simpler than having to manage files on flash drives, uploading/downloading files, etc. I had been using an ASUS Eee 900 previously, but its processing power and hard drive space were quickly becoming limiting factors. I upgraded to this system at the beginning of October and have been very pleased. Being able to game between classes has been a plus as well.

Those who obsess over playing games at the highest resolution with all settings at Ultra will be disappointed, but those people should know better than to be looking in this price range anyways. If you want to game with good framerates at something better than the lowest settings, you'll be pleased with this system. Running WoW, Starcraft II, TF2, BFBC2, and Mass Effect 2 at 1366*768 resolution with medium-to-high settings all produce capped framerates in normal situations and minimal framerate drops in more intense situations.

Other notes in a few quick bullet points:
PROS:
- i7. They're so far ahead of anything else out there right now, buying anything that isn't an i3 or above seems almost like a waste of money.
- Save for the lights on either side, fairly non-flashy case. Some might want the looks of the ASUS G-series. I like this as it's less of a target to be stolen and has a more professional look for use in the workplace.
- Palm rests below the keyboard are rubberized. No more leaving palm imprints in cheap, coated plastic.
- Numpad. Priceless when working in Excel during accounting courses. 0 key is slightly smaller to make room for the arrow keys, but you get used to it.
- Does a very good job of keeping the system cool. The bottom of the case on the right side stays completely cool. The left side is slightly warm to the touch, but certainly still cool enough to place on your lap without it becoming uncomfortable. However, be aware of where you sit. If there's someone sitting to your left with their own computer, their mouse hand will get extremely hot as that is where your exhaust vent is.

CONS:
- Max screen resolution of 1366*768. Not an overly big deal for most productivity applications, but fonts can sometimes get squished in games.
- Battery life. Don't expect to be gaming for hours without a power source nearby. Using the power options, turning down screen brightness, shutting off WiFi, and only running essential apps, I can get it to last through 2 hour lectures, but that's pushing it. Playing games unplugged will give you lower framerates than when on AC power, and will drain your battery dry in a matter of 30-40 minutes.
- The two lights on the side. They're bright in a dark room, and they blink when the computer is put to sleep. If you're going to be keeping this in a bedroom, plan to shut it down at night.
- Touchpad is just barely in position to be in contact with your left palm at homerow position. Non-issue for me, personally, since I shut off the touchpad and plug in a mouse.

"Pros:
-very light and portable
-very quiet (fans automatically adjust depending on system temp)
-good set of speakers in it (they get pretty loud and still maintain clear sound
-multi-touch track pad works well
-facial recognition works well
-HDMI out is amazing, I use it to connect to my tv
-the screen is very clear and there are shortcut keys on the keyboard to adjust the brightness
-laptop is fast with the Intel i5, 4gb of RAM, and the HD 5470
-battery life is around 3.5 hours which is pretty good considering the hardware you are running off a 6-cell battery
-keyboard has plenty of shortcut keys (volume, brightness, media controls, wifi toggle, HMDI toggle, camera, battery mode)
-comes with a 2 year warranty and a 1 year accidental warranty

Cons:
-microphone isn't very good
-keyboard has a little too much flex (it takes time to get used to, doesn't really seem to bother me that much anymore)
-disk drive is tray style, slot style would be much better
-only one audio port which means you need an external sound card in order to use 5.1 surround sound speakers

Overall its a very good laptop with a few minor flaws. For the price you cannot beat it, I tried building a similar laptop with Dell and Lenovo and both came out to around $1000. This laptop is great if you need a portable laptop that is also large enough to be used as a desktop replacement. It has a lot of great features packed into it and I would definitely recommend this laptop.","['quiet fan', 'system temp good', 'clear sound multi touch track', 'work facial recognition work hdmi', 'amazing use', 'clear shortcut key keyboard', 'brightness laptop', 'fast intel gb ram hd battery life hour', 'hardware run cell battery keyboard plenty shortcut key volume brightness medium control wifi toggle hmdi toggle camera battery mode', 'year warranty year accidental warranty', 'con microphone good keyboard', 'time bother', 'disk drive tray style slot style', 'audio port', 'need external', 'sound card order use surround', 'sound speaker overall good laptop', 'minor flaw price', 'similar laptop dell lenovo', 'great need', 'portable laptop', 'large desktop replacement lot']"

The hard disk showed up in the system log as having numerous problems.  I thought it may have been a virus issue but Norton and Malwarebytes said otherwise.

"Asus K42jr-a1 Review

Quick Synopsis:  After putting a little time into it, its a quick, peppy system that can play movies and handle most games.  As long as you aren't an extreme gamer, this system will work for you.

The Asus K42jr-a1 runs very smooth and can handle everything I have thrown at it.  I used the recovery partition to reinstall on a single partition, but I have heard of just doing a fresh install.  This also works.  As with many laptops these days, lots of bloatware, but I was aware of this, and cleaned out what I didn't want.  If you are a little weary fully deleting programs (even though you have the utility disk), just deactivate the services and stop certain programs from starting at the boot.  This will also increase your performance.

****NOTE:  When the computer was first booted, it seemed very sluggish.  At times, the cpu light was on, but it appeared nothing was happening.  Task Manager showed no CPU activity.  After a couple minutes, the computer would resume what it was working on.  But, this freezing, or sluggish activity would occur every 5 minutes or so. After some research, I found this obscure, but simple solution.  From (...)

I did my market research and ASUS was listed as the best buy for the money, but I didn't expect to be so happy!

"God help you if you should have to deal with customer service on a laptop. I purchased one of these and within 3 months was having lots of power supply/charging issues. Asus' response was to update the drivers, which were already up to date. So within 3 months of that, the computer literally fried and went up in smoke. Yes, it is under warranty, and the long warranty they offer is great. Unless you actually have to use it. It has been a full 28 days right now since Asus has been working on my laptop. I have spent hours on the phone with them trying to get a status. The concept of a supervisor doesn't exist there. They are more than happy to set the phone down for a half hour and come back later to see if you are still there. So my nearly new computer is still sitting in their repair facility almost a month later. So consider yourself warned. Take these reviews that mention the reliability and customer support to heart and save yourself the trouble and look elsewhere.

The screen is big and looks great. I will give it that much. But it means nothing when the entire machine goes up in smoke and the manufacturer doesn't even seem to know how to fix it.

The computer is big and not for easy transportation but if you use it instead of having a desktop I highly recommend it.  I will say that if it would have been full price when I purchased it, I wouldn't have bought it but if you can pick up this computer for under $1000 you can't go wrong.  It is a very good gaming computer, not top of the line mind you but it runs games like Dragon Age and Mass Effect 2 at their highest settings.  The screen is beautiful and has a very large display.

"The reviews prior to this one say what a great laptop this is but that it lacked a Blu-Ray player.  The description must have been off when most people first ordered this, and I would be upset if I had thought I was getting blu-ray player, but didn't.  That being said, and I knew what I was getting.  Let me be clear; this is an AMAZING value for what you're getting...even without Blu-Ray.  Think about it; you're getting an Intel Core i7 laptop, with a 1GB ATI discrete graphics card, 17 inch, high def screen, and a 500GB hard-drive...oh and 4GB of Kingston RAM...all for under $1200 (as of this writing)?  Are you kidding me?

I love this laptop, and I was a lifelong HP guy, until my screen died after 2 years of use...the build quality on this is incredible, the screen is beautiful, and as for Blu-Ray...meh.  Everything's going disc-less digital anyway.  A few years from now, and everything will be download only anyway.

Don't let the other reviews fool you, this is THE value in laptops, from one of the most well-decorated manufacturers of the last few years.  Check out some sites on the net, do your research, and I'm sure you'll come to the same conclusion I did...this is the laptop to own.

Good luck and happy hunting.

ADDITIONAL INFO (Posted 3/22/2010) after using this laptop for the past few days, I can safely say that this was a great bargain.  It's faster and more responsive than my previous HP that cost 3x as much.  Also, it came with DDR3 1333 RAM instead of the advertised 1066.  Nice little bonus.

"This is a great laptop (with an unadvertised USB 3.0 slot!) except that the glossy non-polarized screen is *extremely* reflective in all conditions, including indoors.

It is so bad that the screen is completely unacceptable to me and this laptop must be returned. An alternative is to replace the screen for about $400 -- note the new kind of ""recessed"""" hinge ASUS uses makes it _impossible_ to get to the two bottom screws to remove the screen -- thus you cannot replace it yourself (as per instructions on ASUS-recommended site [...] which works for other brands) and must send out the entire laptop","['great laptop', 'usb slot glossy non', 'reflective condition', 'indoor bad screen', 'unacceptable laptop return', 'screen note', 'new kind', 'hinge asus', 'impossible screw', 'instruction asus', 'site work brand', 'entire laptop']"
"The HDMI port was loose and could not maintain a connection with my HDTV.  (Yes, I did try other cables, all of which worked with other components.)  I mean the port itself wiggled a bit---not the cable in the port.  Typing anything or just touching the touchpad knocked out the connection to the TV.

If you look at how the port is placed, jammed under the ExpressCard slot, you will see that such a problem is not surprising.  I didn't think about it before buying, though I did see a photo showing the layout.

Also, prospective buyers should note that, despite the ATI 5730's abilities, this laptop does not output 1080p to a TV---even with the latest ATI driver update.

I only had the computer about 36 hours, but I always test as much as I can as soon as I can.  In most other aspects, I'd give this computer high ratings.  The only longterm worry would be heat management, as there doesn't seem to be a lot of venting space for such a hot CPU.  Reading reviews, I always though people were joking about keeping coffee warm by placing a cup next to the exhaust vent.  Really works with this unit!

The keyboard is spongy in the center.

Now for the good:

One reviewer complained about the glare.  Personally, I think it is less of a problem than on many units.  Mine came with a protective sheet of what was either real glass or extremely hard plexiglass over the LCD screen, something that adds strength to the display and upper part of the unit.  I liked it a lot.

Sound is very, very good.  This includes the built in microphone!  I actually got the Windows 7 Speech Recognition to work pretty well in just a couple of hours.

The webcam is ok with color and clarity.  In very bright light the typical built-in webcam lag is not too bad.

Battery life was almost three hours, which is amazing considering the battery only has six cells and powers a quad-core.

The keypad is an Elan, and it was smooth, precise, and responsive.

Fast Seagate HDD.  Atheros wireless that worked very well in public and with my own wireless router.

The recovery disk creation process was as smooth as any I've seen, taking about two hours and requiring five blank DVD's.

I thought this was going to be my baby for the next five or six years.  The bad HDMI port, which, true, could happen on any machine, seemed as much a result of engineering as assembly problems, so I'm going to get something else.  The other reason I won't get this one again is it only outputs up to 720p to an HDTV.  Much cheaper laptops with ATI GPU's do put out the full 1080p.

The spongy keyboard was disappointing also.

I've had an Asus laptop for seven years; it has been very reliable, so I will very likely stick with this brand---but I'll look harder at how the ports are arranged.","['hdmi port', 'connection hdtv yes', 'cable work component', 'port wiggle bit cable port type touch touchpad knock connection tv look port place jam expresscard slot problem', 'buying photo show layout', 'prospective buyer note', 'ati ability laptop output tv', 'late ati driver update computer hour test', 'aspect computer high', 'heat management lot', 'hot cpu', 'review people joke', 'warm place cup exhaust vent work unit keyboard', 'spongy center good reviewer complain glare', 'problem unit', 'protective sheet', 'real glass', 'hard plexiglass lcd screen', 'strength display', 'upper unit', 'windows speech recognition work', 'pretty couple hour webcam ok color clarity', 'bright light', 'bad battery life hour', 'battery cell power quad core keypad elan', 'smooth precise responsive', 'fast seagate hdd atheros wireless work', 'public wireless router recovery disk creation process', 'blank dvd', 'baby year', 'bad hdmi port', 'machine result engineering assembly problem', 'output hdtv', 'cheap laptop ati gpu', 'spongy keyboard', 'disappointing asus laptop', 'brand look', 'hard port']"
"I have had this laptop for several months now, and I must say I love it. It took me a long time to even consider buying a laptop since they simply do not have the capacity of desktop computers. However, after owning this ASUS K52 I have become a believer. The layout is great, the design is sleek, and the performance is above my expectations.

Layout and Design: The layout of the laptop is great. The keyboard design is large and spacious enough that my fat fingers do not make the typos I typically make on other, smaller, designs. It also has a full numpad, which is a feature I truly hate not having available. The screen size is plenty big enough to browse the internet, write papers, and/or play games with ease. It is also a sleek and cosmetically pleasing design with rounded edges and corners.

Performance: Now on to the most important aspect of any computer, its performance. I have been able to run any game I have desired to play (Oblivion, Fallout 3, Star Wars The Old Republic) on medium to high settings without much in the way of slow down and frame rate issues. I haven't had any problems with the hardware malfunctioning through all the use I put this thing through. It boots fast, and it plays fast. I also use this computer for all of my many school papers, payments online, and pretty much everything you can use a computer for these days. It has never failed me and continues to perform today as it did the first day I received it.

Conclusion: Overall, it's a great piece of machinery. I love it. It serves all of the purposes I have had for it. There are more pricey laptops out there with a bit more power under the hood, but I have found this one to have plenty to run all the games I love and to quickly and reliably completely all the other tasks I have had for it.","['laptop month', 'capacity desktop computer', 'own asus believer layout', 'great design sleek performance expectation layout design layout laptop', 'great keyboard design', 'large spacious fat finger typo', 'small design numpad', 'available screen size plenty', 'big browse internet', 'edge corner performance', 'important aspect computer performance', 'able run game desire play oblivion fallout star wars', 'old republic medium high setting way', 'slow frame rate issue problem hardware malfunction use thing boot', 'fast play', 'fast use computer school paper payment online', 'pretty use computer day', 'conclusion overall', 'great piece machinery', 'purpose pricey laptop bit power hood', 'plenty run game']"
"I have had this product for two years now. In fact, my two year warranty ran out four days ago. However, I am having hardware failures for the third time since my purchase.

I work in IT and take very good care of this notebook. It never leaves my desk unless I am travelling and I am careful to keep the notebook safe while travelling. I keep my computer free of viruses and malware and regularly clean it with CCleaner and a disk defrag. However, one year after my purchase my hard drive was the first piece of hardware to fail me. I sent in my notebook and two weeks later received my notebook with a new HDD.

A few months ago, my notebook started failing again until it finally would not boot at all. I sent it in and again they fixed my issues and sent me back my new notebook. However, they only replaced the motherboard and the back of the laptop and did not fix the cracked casing around my screen or the dead pixels on my screen like I had requested.

Now, four days after my warranty has run out, my battery has stopped charging and my computer will not turn on unless it is plugged in. This is generally fine for me although it is an inconvenience. However, my HDD also seems to be failing as it has started making clicking noises that are a sign of it failing and documents have been taking far to long to pull up. I contacted Asus support and even though my warranty so recently ran out and I've already had to send in my notebook twice for issues that never should have happened in the first place, they refuse to provide me with service.

In short I do not recommend this notebook to anyone looking for a quality PC. The parts must be terrible quality to fail so quickly and the customer service I've received has been terrible in comparison to any other company I've ever dealt with.","['product year fact year warranty run day', 'hardware failure time purchase work good care notebook', 'desk travel', 'careful notebook', 'safe travel computer', 'free virus malware', 'clean ccleaner disk defrag year purchase', 'hard drive piece hardware', 'notebook week', 'new hdd month', 'fix issue', 'new notebook', 'motherboard laptop fix', 'dead pixel screen', 'request day warranty run battery', 'charge computer', 'inconvenience hdd', 'click noise', 'long pull contact asus support warranty', 'place refuse', 'notebook look quality pc part terrible quality', 'customer service', 'terrible comparison company']"
"I had been researching laptops for more than a year before I bought this one. After buying my son an ASUS UL50VT for Christmas after extensive research, I was hooked on ASUS. Good reviews, nice design, good performance. My laptop needs are viewing movies and shows, heavy surfing, downloading and burning, playing music, and light gaming. This is perfect for my needs.

The first thing I noticed about this one is the keyboard; it is a 'chiclet design' with wider caps which make it extremely comfortable for typing. A lot less errors on my part. The ELAN touchpad (smartpad) is super. For the last year, I have borrowed a friend's ACER and his touchpad drives me crazy. It zooms, the cursor moves and jumps about all the time, frustrating me to no end; I finally had to disable it completely. With this computer, palm detection notes the difference between the palm and a finger so that the cursor doesn't jump around while typing. You can also do pinch and zoom. The large palm rest area is supercomfortable as well and minimizes smudges, unlike the rubbery type ones you see which I hate.

I like the Power4Gear which allows you to select your desired processor mode to conserve battery life and have fan power adjusted. Very handy. The Intel I3 Core is more than enough for my needs, lightening fast, and the NVIDEA GEFORCE 310M graphics is excellent for the light gaming that I do.

The sunken hinges enhance viewing by providing a wider more comfortable and less distracting viewing experience, as well as making the laptop look much more visually appealing and sleek. The sound is great (SRS with ALTEC lansing speakers) for media and music. The computer is really sleek and cool looking and my son prefers it to the design of his.

The first thing that I didn't like is the screen brightness; unless I have it on full brightness, I can't see it. It seems to be dimmer than others I have used, even on full brightness, but maybe it's my imagination? I had it side by side my friend's ACER, with the annoying touchpad, and my son's ASUS UL50VT and both of their screens appeared brighter.

My major disappointment is the battery life, despite a little sticker on the computer that states 'great battery power' or something like that. With screen brightness mid range and just using it for moderate surfing and office applications, the battery only lasts two hours. I had expected more. Another annoying thing is the frequent disappearance of the power icon in the taskbar; the setting to turn it on in the taskbar is greyed out. After googling some forums, I followed the recommendation, logged off and back on. Bingo, the power icon was back. But since the battery life is a disappointment, I don't want to be fiddling around trying to see the power icon to have notice of when it will die.

Conclusion: excellent value. Biggest PRO: other than the speed of I3 (and it is really really fast), it would be the touchpad and keyboard. Biggest CON: battery life.","['research laptop year', 'son asus ul vt christmas', 'extensive research hook asus', 'good review', 'nice design good performance laptop need view movie show', 'perfect need thing notice keyboard chiclet design', 'wide cap', 'comfortable type lot error elan touchpad smartpad', 'super year borrow friend acer touchpad drive', 'crazy zoom cursor', 'time frustrate end', 'computer palm detection note difference palm finger cursor', 'type pinch zoom', 'large palm rest area minimize smudge', 'rubbery type', 'power gear', 'select desire processor mode', 'battery life fan power', 'handy intel core need lighten', 'fast nvidea geforce graphic', 'excellent light', 'sunken hinge enhance view', 'comfortable distract view experience', 'laptop look', 'appealing sleek', 'sound great srs altec lanse speaker medium music computer sleek', 'design thing', 'screen brightness brightness dimmer brightness', 'imagination friend acer', 'touchpad son asus ul vt screen', 'bright major disappointment battery life', 'sticker computer state', 'great battery power', 'screen brightness mid range', 'office application battery', 'frequent disappearance power icon taskbar setting', 'taskbar grey google forum', 'recommendation log bingo power icon battery life disappointment', 'power icon notice', 'excellent value', 'big pro speed', 'fast touchpad keyboard', 'big con battery life']"

"After doing quite a bit of research, I decided to purchase this Netbook.  This is even after highly considering the PU17 which as mentioned earlier comes with a recovery disk but not the nice matte soft touch exterior.  The reason this specific model does not come with a recovery disk is because there is one-touch recovery built in which will restore the PC to its original state from files which are located on the hard drive.  From my understanding, people better start getting used to this since it seems to be where every manufacturer is going.  I also chose to install Windows 7 Ultimate 32-bit instead of sticking with the Starter Edition (see ya later bloatware!!!) which runs very very well on only 1GB of RAM.  I have the 2GB upgrade coming this week (just make sure you get a RAM with CL=5).  The reason I didn't install 64-bit is because you can't use more than 2GB of memory and also because I didn't want to have any driver issues.  In the end, it makes very little difference.  So far it seems that Win7 Ultimate even runs better and smoother than the Starter version, mostly due to the removal of all the crapware that comes pre-installed.

Couple of things to note:  I installed the new OS using a bootable flash drive due to the lack of a CD/DVD Rom Drive (You can make any basic flash drive bootable).  Also, when I was installing the new OS, there were 4 partitions on the HDD.  Two of the partitions were your basic space allocated to storing installed programs/data storage etc, however, there was also 10GB and 17MB partitions which from my understanding contain recovery files.  To be safe, just leave these partitions alone.

All in all, I am very happy with this Netbook and am glad I purchased it.

The mouse button is so hard that you pretty much have to bang on it for a click. I thought it would break-in over the time, but it never did. For over 3 months that I used it, I really felt handicapped. The glossy surface is a bit annoying with fingerprints showing everywhere all the time but I could've lived with it. I just couldn't deal with the horrible mousepad anymore. I just sold it on ebay (so relieved!) and got an ipad!

"Aug. 2011 - update of my original June 2010 review:  and increased to 5 stars.
I still love this little computer.  Amazon replaced the original one with another of same model and the battery seems to be hanging in there just fine - not getting 14 hours but regularly 10-12 so that's pretty good.

Ordered the slightly newer model in June 2011 for my son and husband - it gets lots of use too!

Orig review:
I love the ASUS Eee PC Seashell 1005PE-PU27.  I paid a bit more for the matte black case AND especially wanted the longer battery life (supposed to be 14 hours).
SO I am disappointed in the battery life - not as advertised.  I let it charge fully when it arrived nearly a week ago, and have used it to run down the battery (to 10-20%) and re-charged at least 3 times already.  The absolute top battery life I've seen is 11hrs.45min. - that's only 84% of what it should be.  False advertising? Or bad battery?

When plugged in and charging, the charger, battery, bottom of unit and area left of mouse pad all get very warm - hot.  Is this normal?

I also ordered a 1005PE-MU17 at the same time for a friend and it's battery seems to be functioning at the near advertised expected life of 11 hours.

Suggestions please!

PS  Other than battery life, I'd give this great little netbook 5 stars.","['aug update', 'original june review increase star', 'computer amazon', 'original model battery', 'pretty good order', 'new model june son husband', 'lot use orig review', 'asus eee pc seashell pe pu pay bit matte', 'black case', 'battery life suppose hour disappoint battery life advertise', 'battery charge time', 'absolute battery life', 'hrs min', 'bad battery plug charge charger battery unit area', 'warm hot normal order pe mu time friend battery function', 'life hour suggestion ps battery life', 'great little netbook star']"
"PROs:  Light weight, great textured matte black rubberized surface, remarkable battery life, great improvement over 1005HA-P, Express (Rapid access Linux) feature access

CONs:  Short Right Shift key, 0.3MP Webcam, shared (not dedicated) Video memory, no recovery DVD, no slipcover, shiny LCD surface (glare magnet)

This is our fourth ASUS Eee PC Netbook, fifth Netbook counting our Samsung.  Turned it on, set up Windows 7 Starter, updated RAM to 2GB Kingston, migrated in our settings and files, and can't go back to my 1005HA-P Seashell.  Snappy, solid feel without excess weight, great slope for the keyboard with the battery at the back.  Pretty much agree with the previous 10 reviews (except for our lack of hardware problems).  Waiting for iGo to produce a tip for it.  Same Auto DC adapter as the 1005HA and 1008 models.  Already see a tussle brewing over who grabs it first.  If this had the 64MB dedicated DDR3 Graphics memory, Ion and Broadcom graphics and HD chips, matte surface LCD, matte surface keyboard surround, 1.3MP Webcam and retained the 14 Hour maximum battery life, and the Right Shift key off the 1000HE keyboard, it would be darned near perfect.

"I've had this netbook for a few months now, and for my needs, it's really great. I am finishing up my masters online, so I needed something that was compact and easy to travel with. It easily fits into my purse and the battery life is insane. When just working on papers and doing light surfing I can get almost 10 hours, and I don't have a tv, so I can stream about 7 hours worth of video without having to plug it in. The biggest con is that the Windows 7 starter is extremely basic. I didn't add any extra memory to it, and I have Office 2010 professional with all of the bells and whistles and it works fine. Skype seems to take a while to load on it for some reason. I don't download tons of music, videos, or pictures, so maybe I would need to add more memory, but for my purposes of school, surfing the net, and watching videos online it's perfect. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a netbook, it really gets the job done and works wonderfully!","['netbook month need', 'great finish master online need', 'compact easy travel', 'fit purse battery life insane work paper', 'hour tv stream hour', 'worth video', 'big con windows starter', 'extra memory office', 'professional bell whistle work', 'fine skype load reason download ton music video picture', 'memory purpose school surf net', 'video online', 'job work']"
"Overall, it's a good machine that meets my needs, but there seems to be a problem with the bluetooth - not sure if it's the problem of the machine or the system (considering Windows Vista's performance, I wouldn't be surprised if it is Windows 7 that causes this trouble).

My Asus can detect other bluetooth devices and send files, but it can't receive any files, either a word document or a picture from other bluetooth devices such as a PC with Windows Vista and a cell phone. Connecting with a bluetooth mouse also needs extra effort. I paid more for its bluetooth feature, but so bad I can't use it. Called their customer service, but they said that's the problem of the other end, so I have to call the manufacturer of my other bluetooth devices -- a PC company, a cell phone company, a mouse company etc. to find the answer. Frustrated and disappointed!

Other than that, the touchpad doesn't work so well as expected.","['overall good machine meet need problem bluetooth', 'sure problem machine system', 'windows vista performance', 'trouble asus detect bluetooth device', 'file word document picture bluetooth device pc windows vista cell phone', 'bluetooth mouse need', 'extra effort pay bluetooth', 'bad use', 'customer service', 'problem end manufacturer bluetooth device pc company cell phone company mouse company etc', 'disappoint touchpad work']"
"I purchased this netbook in connection with my current trip to the Philippines. Very convenient, light. I can just imagine how much difficulties I would have endured if instead I'm lugging my laptop. No problem connecting with Wifi's. The problem is when only a broadband exists as it happened in some places; I wish I know how to connect with it (the broadband).

I charge the battery full each time but the indicator fluctuates between 8-10 hours. No 14-hour battery life as advertized. Also, I doubt if the indicated hours is reality-based because I noticed sometimes that the charge goes out faster than its indicated content. It's okay with routine works but sometimes more juice is needed and there's nowhere to recharge. Is Asus willing to accept a return for exhange or is the same kind of battery available and affordable to purchase? By the way, I have not added memory or anything to the item.

Another gripe: In using Works/Wordpad/Notepad for wordprocessing, the cursor has a way of jumping all over the place (indiscriminately) without intent on my part such that inputting a text in a sentence in one place would suddenly have its continuation written in another place on the same page.","['purchase netbook connection', 'current trip philippines', 'convenient light', 'lug laptop problem', 'wifi problem broadband', 'broadband charge battery time indicator fluctuate hour hour battery life advertize doubt', 'hour reality base notice charge', 'content okay', 'routine work juice need recharge asus', 'return exhange kind battery', 'available affordable purchase way', 'memory item gripe', 'wordpad notepad', 'cursor way', 'place intent inputte text sentence place', 'place page']"
"I just paid $340 for this netbook, and it was well worth the money. I bought it for my wife to use around the house, and to take with her to class. Once she got used to using the smaller 'laptop' she loves it. I did all the research I could and came down to the fact that this was the best buy. The build quality, features (including Bluetooth!), low heat output, and excellent battery life I've seen on it so far make me feel like I could've paid $400 for it.

The first thing I did was try a recovery using the hidden partition. You basically don't need any CD like the one review complained about. The recovery partition acts as your restore cd. The 3 step directions are in the short user manual on how to use it. I restored it to factory settings in about 15 minutes, just to try it out.

Next thing I did was clean up all the extra add-on softare. There's plenty to remove so try out everything first, then decide what you can remove to free up some resources.

Another intersting feature is the 'instant on' feature. It's like another power button, but boots right into a menu that will open a basic web browser and let you get on the internet, all without ever having to wait to boot into Windows. I could see her using it to quickly jump on and look up something.

Adding another 1GB of RAM would probably be nice, but she's not crunching anything intensive on this thing to make it worthwhile. If you're doing a lot of multi-tasking you probably want a beefier laptop anyway. Maybe down the road when the RAM is $20 we'll throw it in, but she's only doing one or two things at a time anyway.

I'm an IT professional and would recommend this over anything else right now to those looking for a netbook. You won't find anything else that compares at this price range.","['worth money', 'wife use house class', 'small laptop', 'fact good', 'low heat output', 'excellent battery life', 'need cd', 'review complain recovery partition act restore cd step direction', 'short user', 'manual use restore factory setting minute', 'softare plenty', 'free resource', 'power button boot', 'open basic web browser', 'boot windows', 'gb ram', 'nice crunch intensive thing worthwhile lot multi task', 'beefy laptop', 'road ram', 'thing time', 'price range']"
"This is a great netbook.  At times it may lag just slightly, but overall the performance is great for the money.  I have already upgraded to Windows 7 Ultimate, which seems to be faster than the pre-installed Windows 7 Basic, but I imagine that is because I didn't put back on every piece of Asus software.  It's even running the AERO theme on 1GB of memory; 2GB upgrade is on its way.  To comment on the other review which mentioned there is no recovery disc, that is true, and is the only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5.  But knowing this ahead of time would NOT have changed my purchase.  Until I read the other review, I actually thought they may have just left my disc out.  Good to know it wasn't just mine and sounds like a recovery disc isn't included with this model.  Most recent versions of utilities and drivers are easily found on Asus's website.  And as far as being able to reinstall Windows 7 Basic, there is a 10GB hidden partition (which is mostly full) on the hard drive that holds all the necessary files to return the netbook back to its original state.  I have not personally tried this, but have read multiple sources online stating that is what this partition is for.  I have only used this for 3 days now, but so far very satisfied.

One last note, the matte cover is nice, but the screen frame and area below the keyboard is still a finger print magnet.","['great netbook time', 'overall performance', 'great money upgrade windows', 'ultimate fast pre instal windows', 'piece asus software run aero theme gb memory gb upgrade way comment review', 'recovery disc', 'true reason star', 'disc good', 'recovery disc', 'recent version utility driver', 'asus website', 'able reinstall windows', 'basic gb hide partition', 'hard drive hold', 'necessary file return netbook', 'original state', 'multiple source online state partition day', 'note matte', 'nice screen frame area keyboard finger print magnet']"
"I ordered this netbook for my husband and we were both very excited when it came in the mail.  Unfortunately, once it was charged up and ready to go, we found that the internet barely connected anywhere in our house.  Even standing right in front of the wireless router, I only got 3 out of 5 bars of connectivity.  I restarted both the netbook and the router, checked for bios updates and uninstalled and reinstalled the driver software.  All the while, our laptop computer connected to the internet with full coverage and no problems.
Nothing worked for the netbook, so I called up the Asus help line to see what they could recommend.  Both me and the guy I spoke with on the other line had a hard time understanding each other because of a language barrier and I think this may have contributed to the frustration.  He told me there was nothing wrong with my netbook and that I needed to be standing within 5-10 feet of the router for the connection to work.  I explained that this was absurd and that I wanted to send it back for one that worked.  Needless to say, the conversation ended badly.  Luckily, Amazon allowed me to return it anyway.  As always, they have the best return policy.  As I told the fellow on the phone, I won't purchase anything from Asus any longer, but I will definitely get my next netbook from Amazon.","['order netbook husband', 'house stand', 'wireless router', 'connectivity restart netbook router check bio update', 'reinstall driver software laptop computer', 'internet coverage problem work netbook', 'hard time', 'language barrier', 'contribute frustration', 'wrong netbook need stand foot router connection work', 'work needless conversation end', 'return good return policy', 'fellow phone', 'purchase asus', 'netbook amazon']"

"For a netbook, the system is adequately powerful and fast: I have been able to run such programs as MS Office 2010, Photoshop, Acrobat Pro, Dreamweaver, and SPSS on it, and I have been able to watch movies and do everything that I need to do online on it. The battery is truly long-lasting (if you use the wireless card sparingly and don't set the screen at its brightest setting). I have an earlier Eee PC netbook model that this netbook is replacing, and I want to point out that it was very clear to me that ASUS have been listening to user feedback: They have improved the design from previous netbooks substantially. The screen is just a tad bigger than in previous models, and it is just big enough as to not be annoying. I think that at 10.1 inches they have found the optimal screen size for a netbook. Very importantly, the keyboard has been much improved. In previous netbooks, the small keys took some getting used to and even then were difficult to use and created strain. ASUS have resolved this issue by making the netbook slightly bigger and leaving space between the keys of the keyboard. This results in very intuitive typing, essentially no wrong hits, and an easy use - no worse than any laptop-type computer. In fact, I actually like the keyboard, even though I did not get a netbook with the intention to use it for much typing. In addition, ASUS have changed the keyboard layout slightly and have resolved some issues that their previous models had - for example, the PageUp and PageDown keys are now easy to use because they have positioned an Fn key right next to them. These little improvements have resolved my discontents with previous netbooks. The only thing that remains slightly annoying is the metallic sound of the speakers; obviously, one wouldn't buy a netbook for its speaker quality, but I was surprised that the speakers have not improved a bit from previous models. The solution for me is to use a pair of good earbud phones instead of the speakers. Good job, ASUS. My main point of discontent is the choice to sell this with Windows 7 Starter instead of XP or 7 Home; this is mostly Microsoft's fault, not ASUS's, but I have to agree with other reviewers that Starter is an annoying interface. Windows Home is a very marginal improvement from 7 and is not worth the money, so I understand why ASUS would sell this with Starter; furthermore, Windows 7 is a stable and fast system. Nevertheless, its limitations in terms of being able to customize the appearance of the graphic user interface are inappropriate for a netbook. In a netbook, one needs to be able to get rid of unnecessary embellishments to the interface that take up screen space, because the screen space is limited. Windows 7 Starter is limited in this regard, on purpose, by Microsoft, so that you would spend money on Windows Home, and this makes me angry. It's not even the inconvenience that is the problem, it's the evil-hearted marketing decision by Microsoft that embitters me toward Microsoft and, by association, toward Asus. In summary, this is a great netbook, and it is obvious that ASUS have been listening to customers and making slight but valuable improvements to their netbooks that have resulted in this fine product. Windows 7 Starter spoils it enough to take off a star.","['netbook system', 'powerful fast able run program ms office photoshop acrobat', 'pro dreamweaver spss', 'movie need online battery', 'wireless card', 'bright setting', 'eee pc netbook model netbook', 'clear asus', 'user feedback', 'previous netbook', 'screen tad', 'big previous model', 'optimal screen size netbook', 'previous netbook', 'small key', 'difficult use', 'strain asus', 'space key keyboard result intuitive', 'wrong hit', 'easy use', 'bad laptop type computer fact', 'keyboard netbook intention use', 'addition asus', 'keyboard layout', 'previous model example pageup pagedown key', 'easy use position fn key', 'previous netbook thing', 'sound speaker', 'netbook speaker quality', 'previous model solution use pair good earbud phone', 'speaker good job asus', 'main point discontent choice', 'windows starter', 'xp home microsoft fault asus', 'reviewer starter', 'interface windows home', 'marginal improvement', 'worth money', 'starter furthermore windows', 'stable fast system limitation term', 'able customize appearance graphic user interface', 'inappropriate netbook netbook need', 'able rid unnecessary embellishment interface screen space screen space', 'windows starter limit regard purpose microsoft', 'money windows home', 'angry inconvenience problem', 'decision microsoft embitter microsoft association asus summary', 'great netbook', 'obvious asus', 'slight valuable improvement netbook result', 'fine product windows starter spoil star']"
"OUT OF THE BOX

I bought the ASUS 1005PE as an upgrade from my ASUS eeepc 2G Surf.  As soon as it arrived, I plugged it in for the recommended eight hours.  I turned it on and was surprised by how slow this 1005PE was compared to the 2G surf.  I thought, this is an upgrade???  Of course, I hadn't yet implemented Turtle James's recommendations.  If you hadn't read his review, it would be well worth your time.

The things that improved performance:

1)  Speed noticeably increased when I got rid of WebStorage.

2)  Speed improved with upgrade to 2 GB RAM.

3)  More improvement using ReadyBoost.

4)  Started using Firefox and surfing has never been better.

Now, my 1005PE is no longer sluggish, thanks to Turtle James.

INSTANT BOOT

Instead of booting the regular way, there is a button for instant boot, which is exactly as it says.  This is supposed to be a quick on for the system to do things like web, photos, Skype.  Of course, not everything boots up.  I cannot use my USB modem.  Only WiFi or wired internet access is possible.

The instant boot screen is very slow and unresponsive.  For something that is supposed to be quick, it is very sluggish.  I'd rather boot the old fashioned way and get the most out of my computer.

OTHER THAN SPEED

Of the aesthetic details, the cover is rubbery.  I'm not sure how much I like that.  At least I can grip it easily.  The inside is glossy and a fingerprint magnet.

The touchpad works but takes a little getting used to.  I found it worked better after I went into the control panel to tweak it.  Still I prefer using a mouse.

The screen is beautiful.  No complaints there.

The sound is not great.  Sounds like a small computer, but it is a small computer so I'm not disappointed.  I'm not planning on using this as my music player.

The computer runs cool, even when I've had it on for hours.  My 2G Surf would heat up.  The 1005PE gets a little warm, but not noticeably so.  I could hold it in my lap without being uncomfortable.

I can usually get about 10 hours before the computer dies out on me.  It's a remarkable battery life, considering what I had on my 2G Surf.

I mostly do web surfing on the netbook and for that, Windows 7 Starter has been all that I need.  I haven't seen any reason to upgrade.

I like being able to restore the system with a touch of a button.  No need to save and then hunt for that recovery disc.

PROS:
+ runs well once the system is tweaked
+ small, lightweight and portable
+ cover is rubbery, resists fingerprints and provides grip
+ beautiful screen
+ netbook doesn't get hot
+ long battery life
+ no need for recovery disc

CONS:
- must upgrade and tweak before using
- inside panels are glossy fingerprint magnets
- sound is weak
- Instant Boot is slow and unresponsive
- Instant Boot will not accept USB modem

Overall, I consider this a great buy, but only after all the tweaking.

CONS: Noisy keyboard, keyboard flex, takes some tweaking to get the Broadcom card to work well, bad speaker placement (under the front), stiff trackpad button.

FINAL THOUGHTS
Other users complain about bloatware and there really isn't all that much.  And like any new computer, it takes awhile to configure it.  I also added an SD card for a little ReadyBoost speed bump and will add another gig of RAM, but when it's in Super Performance mode, it does everything with minimal, if any, hesitation.  I'm hoping the extra RAM will speed things up.

I bought this mostly as a media player and it does that well.  480 Hulu can be twitchy at times but Netflix and Youtube play very well.  It's my first time using Windows 7 Starter and so far I haven't found a real need to upgrade.

The battery lasts for well over 8 hours, which is fantastic.  They keyboard is noisy and flimsy but I can type fairly quickly with it.  Frankly, with the video accelerator and the full screen resolution, it's the netbook I wanted at a very reasonable price.  I can live with its few shortcomings.","['niggle flaw pros', 'bright resolution screen', 'great battery life hd accelerator bluetooth smudge', 'free case', 'decent speaker', 'nice touchpad', 'light cons noisy keyboard keyboard', 'tweak broadcom card work', 'bad speaker placement', 'stiff trackpad button', 'final thoughts user complain bloatware', 'new computer', 'awhile configure', 'sd card', 'readyboost speed bump', 'gig ram', 'super performance mode minimal hesitation hope', 'extra ram speed thing', 'medium player hulu twitchy time netflix youtube play time windows starter', 'real need upgrade battery', 'fantastic keyboard noisy flimsy type', 'video accelerator screen resolution netbook', 'reasonable price']"

"After reading the reviews from other buyers on this site, I wanted to buy one at a store to make sure everything's working before bringing one home.

I'm glad I was prepared by others re: the type of product I was getting.

The playback of youtube files at 720p and 1080p produced crisp, sharp slideshow quality. So the processor cannot handle smooth playback. The cpu usage was at a whopping 100% when trying to play the 1080p vid.

Then again, the screen is so small that 480p is amazing already.

Like some others, I don't like the highly reflective screen, but I understand why a matte screen like the 1005PE wasn't used. The pixels are so small that a matte finish would actually distort the light from the tiny pixels.

On the advice of others I immediately upgraded to a 2gb RAM, so I can't say if it's made a difference or not.

Overall, this lil' guy fits the bill for me for internet browsing, skype, and writing papers.","['review buyer site', 'sure work', 'type product', 'playback youtube file', 'sharp slideshow quality processor', 'smooth playback cpu usage', 'vid screen', 'reflective screen', 'matte screen', 'pe pixel', 'small matte finish', 'light tiny pixel advice', 'upgrade gb ram difference overall lil guy', 'fit bill internet']"

"Out of the box it had problems playing 720 HD youtube videos.  I couldn't find any solutions on Asus's support forums, but after some research I discovered that it was due to the current version of Flash Player installed.  For those of you who has the Crystal HD decoder but still gets choppy video performance, you have to download Adobe's Flash Player 10.1 release candidate 4 or newer.  Other than that is very good; extremely long battery life, very clear screen, and spacious keyboard.  Minus the fact that it didn't work perfectly out of the box, i'm very happy with it afterward.","['box problem play hd youtube video', 'solution asus support forum research', 'current version flash player instal crystal hd decoder', 'choppy video performance download adobe flash player release candidate', 'long battery life', 'clear screen', 'spacious keyboard minus fact work', 'happy afterward']"

"I live in Japan and wanted a netbook for my regular flights to and from the U.S. The 1005PR seemed ideal, so I purchased one and had it sent to a relative in the U.S. (Most electronic goods can't be shipped out of the U.S.) Naturally, Murphy's Law kicked in and I received one that did not have the Broadcom chipset. The ensuing struggle with ASUS's phone support to get an RMA was so monumentally horrible that it poisoned me against the ASUS brand permanently. (I had to postpone a trip to the States, so, sadly, I fell out of Amazon's 30-day warranty window.) Here's the message I left ASUS on my customer satisfaction survey:

Dealing with ASUS phone support was so unpleasant that, while I think ASUS products are generally of very high quality and have built two pcs with ASUS motherboards and other components, I will never purchase another ASUS product. I bought an ASUS Eee PC 1005PR-PU17-BK that did not have a functioning Broadcom HD chipset. This problem was widespread and well documented by other purchasers on the Amazon and Newegg websites. Amazon even pulled the netbook off its site for a time because of the problem. Regardless, ASUS's phone support reps seemed to have zero knowledge of this, and they did everything they could, including twisting truth into a pretzel, to avoid giving me an RMA. Good going, ASUS.

"The Asus Eee PC is a pretty good machine considering the low price tag.  It has a higher resolution than many others which means less scrolling when viewing web sites.  HD display is bright and clear.  The advertised eleven hour battery life is relatively acurate.  What sets it apart from other NetBooks is it's hybrid design allows you to browse the web, play games, etc., without having to boot the operating system.  Windows 7 Starter seems pretty good in that we have used it for image searching quite a bit without any problems.  The track pad when we purchased ours was outdated, but Asus has since improved the design.

"With the latest broadcom drivers (3.3.0) and flash software:

pros:

- sleek and well built. Not the thinnest around but the battery is almost flush with the body (not promiscuously hanging in the back as most).
- bright HD screen. You can work as you are used to on a bigger laptop, plenty of room. The fonts are not too small (also can be increased).
- perfect decoding (silky smooth) of 1080p 720p 480p h264 videos files with included  total media theater 3 player and MPC-HC, etc.
- Youtube (windowed) 1080p = ~22 fps, 720p=~22fps
- Youtube (fullscreen) 1080p = ~8 fps, 720p=~12fps. Amazingly, it is still watchable
- youtube (fullscreen with total media theater 3)  1080p, 720p ... silky smooth!. Works from clicking a play icon on the youtube video thumbnails in internet explorer only. 35-60% cpu max in power saving mode for 1080p
- long battery life
- noise cancelling microphones tech (with two microphones)
- great keyboard
- sdcard slot allows the card to be flush with the case

cons:

- webcam could be better in low light but ok in most conditions
- no desktop vsync due to lack of aero in win7 starter => some tearing occur on the desktop. it does not affect playing videos with total media theater 3.
-  touchpad has to be tuned (disable zooming gesture)
- lack of aero on windows 7 starter makes the desktop look laggy so better optimize for performance (remove windows decorations). Tried linux 3d desktop and it is silky smooth so it is a software issue with starter.

"I agree that you should consider waiting before buying the 1005PR. Several people, myself included, are having problems with the Broadcom Crystal HD either not being present or not working.  If you just got yours, check in Device Manager, under Video, Sound, Game Controllers and see if Broadcom Crystal HD is there.  Even if it is, try to play an HD (720P) video from YouTube and see if it stutters or plays smoothly.  I just talked to ASUS and they claim they are unaware of the problem and after I do a complete reinstall, they will send me a RMA to return it, if it still doesn't work.  The 1005PR without the HD is kind of pointless. Oh, and for what it's worth, I don't like the flush mounted track pad, since my finger keeps going off the edge. But I knew that before I bought it and wanted the ability to play HD video. If this problem is fixed, this may turn out to be an excellent netbook.  We shall see.

"I had a Dell 1011 and a Dell Latitude 2100 before, and I really loved the portability factor of the netbook concept. The thing that bugged me the most is the small screen resolution. And FINALLY Asus comes out with a netbook with a HD screen! I considered this netbook along with Sony's and HP's offers that all came with a 1366x768 screen, and finally settled on the Asus because: Sony's is wayyyyy overpriced, HP has a standard 3 cell battery, the 6 cell sticks out, and Asus' reputation and quality.

Pro:
GREAT textured lid. Its very high end feeling, not glossy.
HD screen. now I can finally do some work without having to scroll every 2 seconds.
Long battery life. I never got 11 hours, but I get 6-7 hours on good brightness and everything enabled. And thats more than enough for me.

I too found out that it is impossible to play Dolby Digital 5.1 AC3 on some H264 Blueray files. I could not believe that when you went to open file and pointed TMT3 to a BD folder it didn't open it. I was very disappointed because if you have to play just the .m2ts you lose the chapters and more importantly any of the forced subs. I all ready own the TMT Extreme and thought I would install it. It plays the movie from the BD folder and also has sound BUT the video playback is not fluid at all, It jerks and studders all over the place. I finally had to do a full F9 reinstall to get the old version TMT3 back to working. What a rip off if they try to sell us an upgrade for 99 bucks. I think that the ASUS 1005PR is a great idea but I am already out 425 dollars for it, plus 80 dollars for 2Gigs of ram (what a rip off cause they should have put it in or at least offered it as upgrade since it is painfully slow with out it and after upgrade you are left with a useless 1Gig stick.), so for 500 dollars I might as well wait till some one else offers a comparable net book that will play real HD content. Arcsoft did this same old crap with the Hauppauge HD PVR 1212. It came with TMT but was crippled with no way to edit the files untill you paid more.

"I grew up on PCs, converted via a Macbook Pro to Mac in 2005, and am now converting back to PCs because of this little netbook. Upgraded to 2GB RAM, de-bloated, and stripped down to the basics this computer runs like a dream and can handle a pretty demanding load. Like other reviewers have said, when you get this clean all the bloat off the system, install an extra GB of RAM, and upgrade to Home Premium. I do anthropological fieldwork and this is great for working on Office, uploading raw audio files, storing audio and video for entertainment, and uploading pictures and viewing them. I even uploaded HD video from my camcorder and edited it while in Africa. The last time I did fieldwork with my Mac it overheated and the battery broke. It also slugged through 50 minutes of battery life. This computer, however, charges very fast and stays charged for 10-12 hours. Even after 9 months, I'm still getting 8-9 hours out of this. It runs cool, runs long, and never crashes.

My only complaint is in the actual structure of the computer. Why can't ASUS sell a ""premier"""" line of netbooks made from aluminum that don't feel so cheap?

"Got it 4 days ago and I've been playing with this puppy everyday. Just make sure you update to the new flash 10.1 and also update the drivers for the Broadcom Crystal. It plays youtube HD @ 720p or 1080p without a sweat. Battery time is as advertised. I even upgraded to a Kingston V+ SSD and this thing flies. I have tried several netbooks and even the ""magical"""" ipad","['everyday sure update', 'new flash update driver broadcom crystal play youtube hd sweat battery time advertise upgrade kingston ssd thing fly', 'netbook magical ipad']"
"First let me say that the netbook looks great and is really light. Even with a padded sleeve, this takes up much less room in my bag and is really light.

I read other reviews where fingerprint smudges were mentioned. This definitely happens, and because it's so shiny the smudges are obvious, but they easily wipe off.

Beyond the appearance, the keyboard is nice - actual raised keys that are satisfying to touch. Unfortunately, on a couple of occasions, the keys did not seem to catch up with me as I typed (I type quite quickly) and that meant that I had to go back and revise many words that were misspelled. I like the mouse touchpad and buttons (actually one button with two sides - nice), but it takes a little getting used to.
The screen is bright and crisp and I was pleasantly surprised at the resolution quality.

The netbook comes with 1GB of RAM and I upgraded almost immediately as this was simply not enough and I was not happy with how slow programs and websites loaded. For $60 I bought a 2GB memory card and found it pretty easy to swap in. Note: There is only one card slot, so to upgrade, you will need to get a 2GB card and not an additional 1GB card.
I bought an external ASUS DVD read/write drive for $72 which works well but ends up being a little bulky to carry around once it is in it's case. This is the opposite of what I was trying to do by adding a netbook to my laptop collection.
I have not upgraded to full windows 7 yet but am likely to do that as the starter version of the operating system is very basic and limiting.

By the time you buy the memory card, CD/DVD drive and upgrade to windows you could easily have a richer function laptop (or an ipad and a couple of hundred dollars to spend on content) so I'm not sure I would recommend this to everyone.

The one significant problem that I have encountered is with the headset output. I was trying to use the netbookch a movie on a plane and could not hear anything. Even though I was using noise isolating headphones, the output from the netbook was really low and made it basically useless for media viewing in public (i.e. with a headset).

"I just received this 1005PR yesterday morning, and after reading these reviews here, I checked in my 'Device Manager' list of this unit and confirmed that I DO have an installed Broadcom CrystalHD Video Decoder listed under 'Sound, Video, and Game Controllers' category, and my HD plays smoothly on the included Arcsoft Media Player, but does not play sound, I assume since my sound tracks are in Dobly Digital and this trial version wont let you have all features. The Windows Media Player that is included with Windows 7 Starter doesn't seem to be playing the h.264 video, as it does try to play, but the video is all garbled up and unwatchable. HD on websites using Flash plays fine. But DO upgrade Adobe Flash Player as another reviewer here stated.

 I originally had purchased a 1005HA a few months ago and wound up giving it to my wife (she doesn't care about HD) and got this 1005PR instead and I really like it so far. Except out of the box, I'm not really too happy with their entire software package / bundle. It does run really slow. You have to do all of the standard Win 7 tweaks on it to get the performance back up to par. I had put an SSD drive in the 1005HA I gave to my wife and am really happy with it, so I got another SSD drive to put in this 1005PR but just haven't put it in yet, as I want to make sure I am really happy with the entire unit before I void the warranty just yet and disassemble this thing. I put the 2GB stick of RAM in and it is performing pretty good right now, but I know with the SSD drive installed it will do a lot better. I tested several video files in full 1920 x 1080p and some video cam files in 1440 x 1080p and they play fine in that trial version of Arcsoft Media whatever-it's-called 3 thing, but the sound doesn't work (since it's the trial version doesn't play Dolby copyrighted audio), but I tried these same h.264 video clips using Windows Media Player which comes with this Win 7 starter, and like I said the video is all garbled and unwatchable. I am going to use one of my Windows Anytime Upgrade license keys and upgrade it to full Win 7 Pro which should have the fully functional Windows Media Player and I know it has a very nice h.264 Mpeg 4 decoder built-in so we'll see how that works. I am going to image this OS onto my SSD drive first and then upgrade that one to my Win 7 Pro version. For now I'm going to install my Power DVD 9 Ultra (although it's h.264 decoder is not as smooth as Windows Media Player that comes in Win 7 Pro) and I'll see how that goes.

 As far as the Arcsoft Media Center solution which is included in the software bundle goes, I'm not a big fan of bundled software that is not fully-functional and didn't ship with the laptop in it's fully-functional state. This for some reason irritates me whenever I buy a new computer and none of the included software just simply works forever. I usually get mad and don't even try it too much and uninstall all the trials because I already own programs that usually work better than the trials they've packaged into the software bundle. But ever since I used the latest Windows Media Player (12 I think it is), that shipped on my Win 7 Pro for my other Lenovo Thinkpad I fell in love with their new h.264 decoder because it plays HD smooth as silk, and all my Dish Network Satellite rips are usually broadcast with h.264 compression. It is even smoother than the Power DVD 9 Ultra one by a noticable amount. So my preference as far as a media player would be to try and get Windows Media Player to work. It only ships on the new Windows 7 OSs, and I think the Win 7 Starter might not have the full featured version because like I said, it looks all garbled on this new Netbook. I will post an update when I get my upgrade key installed and I'm running the full Win 7 Pro and post back about whether the h.264 Mpeg4 works at that time.

 But all in all, I am very happy with this new netbook since I don't feel like I'm working through a keyhole, because with the hi-resolution panel I have plenty of screen real estate. The other 1005HA I gave to my wife, even after adjusting the DPI and skrinking everything as small as I could in the software and registry settings, in the end it was still just a 1024x600 panel. This new hi-res panel in this 1005PR makes me feel a lot more at home since I come from a T61p Thinkpad with a 1680x1050 res panel and with all that real estate, I just couldn't get used to the limited resolution that came on netbooks, but this new netbook is the answer to the problem, the reason why I never had wanted to get a netbook before, was the pathetic resolutions they traditionally had. But with this one, I could use this all day, except the processor is still a bit slow for developers as compiling code it is way too slow with the atom processor. But if I have internet connection available, I can still connect to my server at home and do my dev work on the netbook, upload the code to the server, and then have it compile the code, so this is not a deal-breaker, just a small hassle. If they could get these compact netbooks to have real processors with Core2 Duo or Quad even, that would be the bomb. But for now, this little 1005PA is quite the little machine for what it is, and the battery life is amazing. I also bought a second battery for a spare and that's one thing the Thinkpad T61p could ever touch was it could only last maybe close to 2 hrs on battery but this 1005PR lasts more like 8-9 hours on a single battery, and I have 2 of them, so I just leave the charger at home. I do wish I could get a cradle charger though, to charge the batteries without having to put them into the netbook to charge. If somebody made a cradle charger for these and other netbook models, I think it would be a hit sale. Maybe I should send this idea to some Chinese manufacturing company, I'm sure they would jump on the chance.

But I would recommend this netbook to anyone who wants more screen real estate, and the ability to watch HD content since that is where all TV has moved and is still moving. If your netbook did not come with the Broadcom hardware or is not functioning according to the item description, then simply contact Amazon and make them send you the correct model as it was advertised, since it says right in the item description that it has this hardware. Let THEM fight with Asus since they are the big retailer with the strong arm. Amazon has been very reasonable to me as I've bought lots of stuff from them over the years, and they've never been unfair with me, and their return policies are very accomodating, almost as good as Costco's.

I'm giving it 4 stars because the current software package ought to be optimized more for performance because the bloatware makes it run slow on the Atom processor and this may deteer the average consumer who does not know how to reduce the bloatware on their own accord. Once bloatware is removed, and performance settings are optimized, and 2GB RAM is installed, then this machine performs pretty good and works decent for having an Atom processor. Developers typically tend to forget that more code is not always better. The code needs to be sized and taylored for the hardware it is running on. On, my other netbook, I still run Windows Aero Desktop theme and it works fine, but I DO turn off much of the animation in the Visual Settings, like animate menus, and fade or slide menus, etc, etc. As soon as I do the upgrade on this netbook to Win 7 Pro, I will also turn on Aero just because I like the semi transparent taskbar look and color, but I will also disable most of all the animation effects as I did on my wife's netbook. And if you go to the startup tab in msconfig what is all that junk that they think needs to run at startup? This is what I'm talking about. You can still get the pretty looks without slowing the thing down to a noticable amount. It's like they think the Atom processor is not going to go any slower, yet they run all the same stuff as the laptops they sell with the Core2 Duo processors and stuff. But other than that, so far, it looks like a decent netbook.","['review check device manager list unit', 'broadcom crystalhd video decoder list', 'sound video game controllers category hd play', 'arcsoft media player play', 'sound track', 'digital trial version', 'windows media player', 'windows starter play video', 'video garble', 'unwatchable hd website flash play', 'fine upgrade adobe flash player reviewer state', 'wife care hd', 'happy entire software package bundle run', 'slow standard', 'tweak performance par ssd drive', 'ssd drive pr', 'sure happy entire unit void warranty disassemble thing gb', 'pretty good right', 'ssd drive instal lot', 'test video file video cam file play', 'fine trial version arcsoft media', 'sound work trial version play dolby copyright audio', 'video clip windows media player', 'upgrade license key upgrade', 'functional windows media player', 'nice mpeg decoder', 'image os ssd drive upgrade', 'pro version', 'install power dvd ultra decoder', 'smooth windows media player', 'arcsoft media center solution', 'software bundle', 'big fan bundle software', 'functional ship laptop', 'functional state reason irritate', 'new computer', 'uninstall trial program', 'trial package software bundle', 'late windows media player', 'pro lenovo thinkpad fall', 'new decoder play hd', 'smooth silk dish network satellite rip', 'smooth power dvd ultra', 'noticable preference', 'medium player', 'windows media player work ship', 'new windows os', 'new netbook post update upgrade key instal run', 'pro post mpeg work time', 'happy new netbook', 'work keyhole hi resolution panel plenty screen', 'real estate', 'dpi skrinke', 'small software registry setting end panel', 'new hi re panel pr', 'lot home', 'thinkpad re panel', 'real estate', 'new netbook', 'problem reason', 'netbook pathetic resolution', 'day processor bit', 'slow developer compile code way', 'slow atom processor internet connection', 'server home dev work netbook upload code server compile code', 'small hassle', 'compact netbook', 'real processor core duo quad bomb', 'machine battery life', 'spare thing thinkpad touch', 'hrs battery pr', 'hour single battery', 'charger home', 'cradle charger charge battery', 'netbook charge', 'cradle charger netbook model', 'idea chinese', 'real estate ability', 'hd content tv', 'broadcom hardware function accord item description', 'contact amazon', 'model advertise', 'item description hardware', 'fight asus', 'big retailer', 'strong arm amazon', 'lot stuff year', 'unfair return policy', 'current software package', 'optimize performance bloatware', 'slow atom processor deteer average consumer', 'bloatware accord bloatware', 'performance setting optimize gb ram instal machine', 'pretty good work', 'atom processor developer', 'code need', 'taylore hardware run netbook run windows aero desktop theme work', 'fine turn animation visual settings', 'animate menus fade slide menu etc etc', 'upgrade netbook', 'pro turn aero', 'semi transparent taskbar look color', 'animation effect wife netbook startup tab msconfig junk', 'need run startup talk', 'pretty look', 'slow thing', 'atom processor', 'slow run stuff laptop', 'core duo processor stuff', 'decent netbook']"

"I am a full time consultant and spent a lot of time in Dec 2010 looking for a laptop that would mostly be a desktop replacement, but that I would also travel with to client sites.  I have had this machine for over 20 months and it has done a great job.  I don't do a lot of heavy computing, but when I do, the core i5 is surprisingly adequate. I don't do heavy graphics, but it is supposed to be adequate for moderate gaming.  I bought this over the more expensive bamboo model because the latter did not upgrade to 8G ram, and the lights indicating things like whether you are plugged in, wireless is running etc were hidden from view. A small thing, but super annoying to have to lift up the computer to see these lights.

Pros:
1. amazing value for money
2. very capable for working IT consultant not doing super heavy computing
3. upgradeable to 8G ram
4. Small enough to use on a plane in economy seating
5. can do moderate gaming
6. backed by Asus 2 year guarantee and I can have it serviced at my local shop where I bought it - an Asus qualified shop.
7. The mouse gestures are really handy, especially for scrolling
8. Very reliable, have not had any problems to speak of
9. Windows 7 and DisplayLink make it very easy to have multiple monitors. I currently use 4, including the laptop screen.

Caveats:
1. not very light, if you want to travel a lot
2. battery life very poor; I get by with an extra battery, but even that only just lasts 4-6 hrs.
3. mouse pad not super smooth or responsive
4. no backlit keyboard

I can probably use this machine for another year or two if need be, but I am shopping around a bit, hoping that Asus will come out with a comparable model with the Ivy Bridge Core i7 chip with flash drive to make things more snappy. Some Ultrabooks have come out recently in this category, but I don't need to pay the premium for super small and light.

This would be a great machine to pick up used, if you can live with the caveats and want Win 7 rather than Win 8.

The other drawback for this laptop is probably the monitor. The resolution is pretty crisp and clear, but my eyes get tired after looking at it for too long. When I use it at home, I always use an external display just to reduce the eye strain.

"First impression:
Started great right of the box, has a really glossy screen which looks really great when its off, sometimes the screen creates some problems thought due to reflection. After doing its own setup, works great.

After 3 months of use, here are some pros and cons

Pros:
Lightweight
Does not heat up due to charging
Has nifty little button on left top corner that turns limited applications on (some linux thing) in as little as 5 seconds. So when you are really crunched on time, its a great handy tool. It lets u surf web, chat, etc. The most useful functionality of laptop in my view
Keyboard absolutely great for the size. (full size)

Cons:
Once my fan started creating loud noise and would not go off till I turned it off. Dont know what caused it but it just happened once. So am ok with it.
Will be sluggish at time (of course its a dual core not a quad).
The webcam is uselessly low resolution.
The startup webcam login is equally annoying as it takes longer to login that way than just typing in the password.

So all in all, its a good laptop to carry around and use basic applications but if you need performance, look for something else (maybe Dell alienware; hear that they are great performance wise)","['great right box glossy screen look', 'great screen', 'reflection setup work', 'great month use', 'pro con pro lightweight heat charge nifty', 'application linux thing', 'crunch time', 'great handy tool', 'surf web', 'useful functionality laptop view keyboard', 'great size size', 'con fan', 'loud noise till', 'ok sluggish time course dual core quad webcam', 'low resolution startup webcam login', 'login way type password good laptop', 'basic application need performance look', 'dell alienware', 'great performance wise']"
"I have very mixed feelings about this laptop.

Pros:

* Battery life really is very long so long as you're not watching HD video.

* Has performed reliably since I bought it

Negatives:

* Minor: Charger is a bit heavy (if you need to carry it around). Turbo33 toggle needs a restart to take effect. The first time I turned it on it wanted to burn recovery discs. This required 5 or 6 discs and the unit doesn't even have a burner. There was no option to save .iso images instead. Why not just put these discs in the box, Asus? Loaded with crapware out of the box. I spent a good hour or two removing it all. No Windows CD (I have an external drive I could use it with) so doing a clean install wasn't possible

* Medium: In my unit the HD clicks frequently. I discovered this was due to the hard drive parking heads every few seconds. The HD is rated for 600K load cycle, and this would easily have been exceeded after 1yr of use if I hadn't found a tool called ""QuietHDD""""","['feeling laptop', 'pro battery life', 'hd video', 'negative minor charger bit', 'heavy need', 'turbo toggle need restart effect time', 'burn recovery disc', 'disc unit burner option', 'iso image', 'disc box asus load crapware box', 'good hour', 'windows cd external drive use', 'clean install', 'possible medium unit hd click', 'hd rate load cycle', 'yr use']"
"I have had this computer for about a year and have by and large been very happy with it.  The battery life is great and using it for classes 8 hours a day without a charger is a huge plus.  I am also able to play some games, but can't have huge expectations for graphics (usually have to run it on the lowest settings).  Now for the complaints:  Build quality is just ok, there are screws on the bottom that come repeatedly loose, and these are the screws that hold the screen to the laptop base.  Keyboard has some flex and the keys themselves seem loose and noisy. My biggest gripe though is that after a year of windows my computed has inevitable become bogged down, and it is time for a reinstallation.  However, ASUS doesn't provide you the a copy of windows to reinstall.  You have to pay $50.00 for a recovery DVD (not to mention a ridiculous $9.00 for S&H).  If I have known this in the beginning, I would not have gotten this laptop.","['computer year', 'large happy battery life', 'great class hour day charger', 'able play game', 'huge expectation graphic', 'low setting complaint', 'quality ok screw', 'loose screw hold screen laptop base keyboard', 'loose noisy', 'big gripe year window', 'inevitable bogge time reinstallation asus', 'copy window reinstall pay recovery dvd']"
"I've been in the market for a portable computer I could get work done on.  I'm a web developer, and I need a device that supports OpenCL, which somewhat limited my selection to computers with discrete graphics.  I thought about stepping up to a computer with a 2010 Core processor (Core i3, or i5), but the were always out of my price range when paired with a decent graphics card, or had sub standard battery performance.

Pros:
So I ended up with this computer.  So far after a week, I love it.  It works, the keyboard is comfortable, the touch pad required some getting used to but I adapted to it quickly.  The battery life has been incredible even on turbo with the graphics card on it will make it though most of a day of work without charging.  With the card off, and with turbo disabled it lasts for the bus ride into work, a full day of work, and the ride home, which is what I wanted and needed since I consider that time on the bus as potentially useful, and so far it has been.  If nothing else I get to go over scripts and read books while I ride, sometimes I put in actual work too.

Cons:
There is a screen flicker.  This is generally when the graphics card is switching.  You can control this by setting the Control Panel up correctly.  If you don't know what's going on, when you unplug it the screen will dim, and after a few minutes the screen will go black then come back on.  This is the computer switching off the Nvidia 210 to the Intel chipset's 4500HD which is far less powerful, but relatively power efficient, which happens after 15 minutes as configured out of the box in the OS.  It also tends to happen when waking up from sleep.

My only other real complaint has to do with the turbo mode which requires you to restart the computer.  On days where I know that I won't be in front of a plug for awhile I turn it off before I head out the door.  Otherwise I just leave it on.  I've managed to get 7 hours with turbo on, and the battery wasn't out of juice, so it's not much of a problem...

Other than that it's the nicest laptop in the house by quite a large margin.  Most of our other devices are at least 5 years old, heavy, don't do what I need, and last maybe an hour off the plug, so this computer has been a breath of fresh air.

The speakers are surprisingly loud for the size, they positively beat up my wife's HP laptop, even if they don't have impressive bass.

The screen is glossy, but I can still read it even in direct sunlight if I crank up the brightness.  Color is pretty darn good, and the vertical viewing angles are good considering it has a TN panel and all.

My other real complaint is that the inside of the computer (the deck, and bezel around the screen) show dust like no one's business.  I'm almost wishing I'd shelled out the extra 20 bucks for the silver version of the laptop.  As it is, I've learned to keep a micro fiber cloth in my computer bag, but it does sometimes bug me.

Otherwise this has been one of the best purchasing decisions I've made in a while.  The computer has the right mix of performance, portability, and battery life to meet all my needs.

updated: 4/10/2013:  This computer died in November.  The side vent fan became jammed, and the system overheated.  This wasn't user serviceable, and trying to pop the bottom of the case off became an exercise in extreme frustration that lead to breaking several of the plastic clips which held the bottom assembly to the top.  So serviceability and DIY repair ended up being the downfall of the system.  Without being able to clean out the gunk the system died.  Other than that the computer itself did reasonably, the hard drive died after 15 months, and was replaced by a SSD (which was a massive upgrade that took a lot of the sting out of loosing the HDD), the plastic around the keyboard broke after about a year and a half, although it was a minor annoyance.  Still overall given the relatively short lifetime the system I'd have to say it wasn't a great purchase, even if it did adequately meet my needs during the time it was with me.","['portable computer work web developer need device support opencl', 'limit selection computer discrete graphic', 'step computer core processor core price range pair', 'decent graphic card sub', 'standard battery performance', 'pro end computer', 'work keyboard', 'comfortable touch', 'battery life', 'incredible turbo graphic card day work charge card turbo', 'work day work', 'time bus', 'actual work', 'con screen flicker', 'graphic card switch control', 'control panel', 'unplug screen dim minute screen', 'computer switch nvidia intel chipset hd', 'minute configure box os', 'wake sleep', 'real complaint turbo mode', 'restart computer day', 'plug awhile', 'head door', 'manage hour turbo battery juice problem', 'nice laptop house', 'device year', 'old heavy need', 'hour plug computer breath', 'fresh air speaker', 'loud size', 'wife hp laptop', 'impressive bass screen glossy', 'direct sunlight crank brightness color', 'pretty darn good vertical', 'angle good', 'tn panel', 'real complaint', 'computer deck bezel screen dust', 'extra buck silver version laptop', 'micro fiber cloth computer bag bug good', 'decision computer', 'mix performance portability battery life meet need update computer', 'november vent fan', 'system overheat user', 'extreme frustration lead', 'plastic clip hold assembly serviceability diy repair end downfall system', 'able clean gunk system', 'hard drive', 'massive upgrade', 'loose hdd plastic keyboard', 'minor annoyance overall', 'short lifetime system', 'great purchase', 'need time']"

Wanted to get a laptop that s not too big but more powerful than a netbook. This one fit the bill perfectly.

"I was trying to decide whether I wanted an iPad or a netbook, but neither really fit the bill. I'm a photographer and I need to have a machine that's fast enough for photography, but something light enough to carry. I never use DVDs to install anything anymore and I need a lot of battery life. This machine is the best choice for me.

Pros:
Battery life: On full power, 4 hrs. On normal use, 9 hours. On power saving, about 11+ hrs. UNBELIEVABLE!
Graphics card: I need a video card that can support Photoshop CS4/5 and Lightroom 3. I don't play games, but I figure 512MB of RAM would be good for that.
Keyboard: absolutely love the chicklet keyboard. It has Home/End keys which are important to me and don't exist on HPs similar line.

Pros:

"My favorite thing about this computer is it's size. Something I didn't think about before I bought it was that it would be really easy to curl op on the couch and cradle the computer between my legs or on my stomach or something. It's just really easy to maneuver physically. And I love how lightweight it is. The only other laptop I had before I got this little guy was an ibook g4 that I received as a graduation present. It was great and gorgeous and very cool and all that, but it didn't really function as a portable computer because in those days laptops were HEAVY, man. Plus no wireless internet. This is like the opposite of that. it's so light I can carry it and my notebook and stuff around in a shoulder bag all day and not really care. It's pretty darn fast on the internet, if you have a good connection. Sometimes, however, it takes forever to get on the login page of a public network, but I think that might just be the network. It's great that it comes with free online storage, although I don't really have enough stuff on here to warrant using it yet. At first the screen and font does seem awfully small, but I really got used to it and the touch pad has little zoom shortcuts so it's easy to do that if you can't see something. This is coming from a college student who has to read a ton of online articles, by the way. When I use my boyfriends laptop now which has like a 17 inch screen or something it feels disquietingly huge. The battery life is awesome, too, although I don't think it's always 11 hours like it says. Maybe if you have it on sleep a lot. But it's still really long, just as good as a lot of smart phones. So anyway, I love this little guy, and I use it way more than I thought I would.

"I purchased the Asus 1005PE-MU27 netbook last week and also ordered the 2gb Kingston memory upgrade card (do not order the one suggested by Amazon, it is the wrong size).  Many people have complained about Windows 7 starter, but I expected it to be a simple operating system to run basic needs such as web-surfing, instant messaging, Skype, youtube, etc.  It does the job well! I am very satisfied with the performance and highly recommend those with a little less patience to go ahead and upgrade to the 2gb RAM.  It's easy to install (unplug charger & battery, remove screw, remove old 1gb ram at an angle and insert new 2gb RAM.

PROS:
- easy to use, light-weight, great travel-use.
- perfect sized keyboard, not too small.
- fast start-up
- Asus express includes instant msg, skype, internet, games.
- I bought the blue netbook and LOVE the color.  It's royal blue!

CONS:
- battery life states 11 hours, I only get about 6hrs and have already dimmed the screen.
- 1gb RAM is too slow for me, upgrade to 2gb for an extra $30 bucks.  You can run more programs w/o the lag.
- finger-print magnet! Better have some clean hands when handling this netbook!

"I just received this netbook a few days ago.. I had the same model with XP that was about 2 years old and quit working. I liked my old ASUS and used it a great deal.. Thought it quit a little before it's time though.. I can't say i'm real impressed with Windows 7 Starter.. It seems real choppy and unsmooth.. Maybe if I bump up the ram it might help.. The e-mail program is something to be desired.. I guess i'm an old diehard Outlook Express user for e-mail and sending photos.. I do have one desktop that is running Windows 7 home and that seems a little better.. For a netbook, I think XP was a better choice. With this one, Start up time is horrible.  Also took a few hours to remove all the free preloaded garbage they install.. In my opinion, i'm not seeing a real advantage to owning this over a regular laptop.  Maybe if you travel quite a bit it would be nice because it's light weight.. The screen is pretty small but it's a netbook..  I do have to give Amazon a big thumbs up, as it arrived way before expected.  Bottom line: maybe ok for everyday e-mailing and surfing, but you can get a laptop for just a little more money and I think most would be happier with a bigger screen, bigger keyboard, and also a faster, smoother operating system.. I would stay with XP, but we have to keep up with the changing times. Soon it will not be supported and Windows 7 will be the main choice.  Unless you're netbook has XP, I would probably keep looking for something other than Windows 7 Starter on a netbook..","['netbook day', 'model xp year', 'old asus', 'windows starter', 'real choppy unsmooth', 'bump ram', 'program desire guess', 'old diehard outlook express user', 'photo desktop run windows home', 'time horrible', 'garbage install opinion', 'real advantage', 'own regular laptop', 'travel bit', 'nice light weight screen', 'pretty small netbook amazon', 'big thumb', 'happy big screen', 'big keyboard', 'system stay xp', 'support windows', 'main choice netbook xp', 'windows starter netbook']"
"I just purchased this netbook after my previous Asus (the dependable S101) died b/c the screen was damaged by my own carelessness.  So with that in mind, here's my quick take on the 1005PE MU27 model, which I received yesterday.

Pros:
- Nice feel of the keyboard.  Firm and the spacing between the keys did not affect my typing in any way.
- Attractive cover (I bought the blue colored unit) and look to the machine.
- Fairly painless installation.  The first boot took about 10 min or so, and updating the latest files for Windows 7 starter took about 30 min, not too bad.
- Based on the 1GB ram usage, surfing the web was a breeze.  Watching videos on youtube or playing flash-based games all was fine.  But at times I did notice some hiccups when many programs were running so I opted to upgrade to 2GB (see below edit for info).
- Battery life was very very decent.  On a full charge on the high performance mode I managed about 7-8 hours.
- Quick charge time for battery.
- Very nice touchpad.  Very responsive.
- Great price point for people looking to do very basic stuff on the computer.

Mehs:
- Screen resolution was ok.  Not really up to part with the higher end counterparts.
- Camera is standard 0.3Mb quality
- Unit is not as 'sleek' compared to my old S-101, which was definitely lighter, more slender, and didn't feel as 'bulky' of sorts vs the 1005PE
- Click button below touch pad a bit clunky.

Cons:
- Windows 7 starter blows.  It's fine if you're just going to use this netbook to do basic stuff like surf the web, send emails, or play games on facebook.  But not recommended if you're looking to do more extensive things with the netbook.
- Did I tell you Windows 7 blows?  Serious lack of customization.  It's lame that you can't even change your desktop wallpaper without downloading some other app to circumvent the problem.  Dumb you can't personalize fonts etc.
- Does not include even a basic cloth cover for the netbook.  Even in my previous S101 unit they included at least a cheap little cover for the netbook.
- Finger print magnet.  Better have clean hands when holding this laptop!
- Feels kind of heavy.  It looks small, but weighs more than you think.  Definitely outweighs my old S101 by a fair margin.  (And boots a bit slower than my old S101, though my old OS was XP, which I still think was great to use).

Summary
- Great computer for price conscious folks
- Great computer for people not looking to do much more than just surf the web, send emails, do basic stuff like type papers etc.
- Is just fine if you can live with the (many) bare-bones limitations of Windows 7 starter.
- Won't blow you away, but is a decent all around machine at a reasonable price point

**EDIT 6/25/10**

I would also like to point out that I decided to upgrade the RAM on this netbook.  It was partially because I wasn't too thrilled with the performance of Windows 7 (I still ABSOLUTELY HATE the lack of customization options on the starter OS.  COME ON MICROSOFT!!!).  But also I noticed sometimes things got a bit sluggish when I ran multiple programs.

Anyway I just want to point out I bought the 2GB RAM from Kingston = Kingston ValueRAM 2 GB 800MHz PC2-6400 DDR2 CL5 SODIMM Notebook Memory (KVR800D2S5/2G) (Link Below):

http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00102A066/ref=cm_cr_mts_prod_img

I would strongly recommend anybody who wants a bit more out of this netbook to consider upgrading the memory.  I noticed a nice difference in performance after my upgrade.  VERY VERY HAPPY that I did so.

For those of you who aren't aware - the Asus memory comes with 1GB RAM that's upgradable to 2GB.  There's only 1 memory slot so you will have to take out the old chip.

To do so - (REMEMBER UNPLUG COMPUTER AND REMOVE BATTERY BEFORE STARTING THIS PROCESS)
1. Remove the single screw from the memory casing on the bottom of th netbook.
2. Remove the old chip (carefully since it comes out at an angle)
3. Insert new chip carefully (again at an angle somewhat) and make sure it snaps into place.
4. Put battery back on, turn on computer, press F2 upon powering up to get into bios and make sure computer recognizes memory.
5. All done.

- Note the kingston memory chip had none of the issues that other users previously noted with other brands.  At least I didn't experience any hiccups.  2GB does make a difference.","['purchase netbook', 'previous asus', 'screen damage carelessness mind', 'quick pe mu model', 'keyboard firm', 'unit look machine', 'painless installation boot', 'min update', 'late file windows starter', 'bad base gb ram usage surf web breeze', 'video youtube play flash base game', 'fine time notice hiccup program run opt upgrade gb edit info battery life', 'decent charge high performance mode manage hour', 'quick charge time battery', 'nice touchpad responsive', 'great price point people', 'basic stuff computer mehs screen resolution ok high end counterpart camera', 'standard mb quality unit sleek', 'bulky sort vs pe click button touch', 'bit clunky', 'con windows starter blow', 'basic stuff', 'surf web', 'email play game facebook', 'extensive thing netbook', 'windows blow lack customization lame', 'desktop wallpaper download app circumvent problem', 'dumb personalize font etc', 'basic cloth', 'previous unit', 'netbook finger print magnet', 'clean hand hold laptop', 'heavy look', 'old fair', 'boot bit', 'slow old old os xp', 'great use summary', 'great computer price', 'conscious folk', 'great computer people', 'surf web', 'basic stuff', 'type paper etc', 'bare bone limitation windows starter', 'decent machine', 'reasonable price point edit', 'upgrade ram netbook', 'performance windows', 'lack customization option starter os', 'microsoft notice thing', 'bit sluggish run', 'multiple program', 'gb ram kingston kingston valueram gb mhz pc ddr cl sodimm notebook memory kvr link http www amazon com gp product ref', 'bit netbook', 'upgrade memory notice', 'nice difference performance upgrade', 'happy aware asus memory', 'gb ram', 'upgradable gb memory slot', 'old chip', 'unplug computer', 'screw memory case th netbook', 'old chip', 'angle insert', 'new chip', 'sure snap place battery', 'computer press power bio', 'sure computer', 'memory note kingston memory chip issue user', 'note brand experience hiccup gb difference']"
"Don't expect much from this computer.  It's ok for surfing the web in a limited manner (if I have more than about 3-4 windows open at a time it starts to get pretty sluggish).  It will probably do what you want it to but it gets around to it in its own sweet time.  Sometimes it completely freezes up and CPU usage leaps to 100% for no apparent reason.  However, it usually WILL figure out what ever its problem is and start working again after a minute or two.

Basically, this computer acts about like the 3 or 4 year-old computer you are probably replacing.  Based on other reviews I just went ahead and ordered the 2GB RAM chip.  I can't even IMAGINE trying to use this computer without it!  If it's as slow this slow with 2GB of RAM I don't even know how Asus can get them off the shelves with only 1 GB of RAM.

Despite the fact that others seem to have no problems streaming video, I have never been able to stream video in anything that I would consider a satisfactory manner.  If you are ok with watching stuff in 30 second to 1 minute bursts (and then waiting for 30 seconds or so while it buffers) then you will probably be completely satisfied with it.  Me, I find that annoying.  Also, sometimes if you pause the video (to allow it to buffer) it won't UN-pause and you have to completely reload the page, negating any forward progress you may have made.

A big selling point for me was the web storage but this proved to be VERY time consuming- I left my computer alone for a full day (plugged in so it was at peak performance) and I only have about 20GB out of ~120GB backed up.  I know that my connection speed had nothing to do with this as I could stream and transfer data with my other computer at a reasonable rate (sorry, I don't know specifics but it was fast enough that it seemed acceptable to me).  Also, the web storage only lasts for a year, after which point you have to pay (can't remember how much, only that it was more than I was willing to pay!) so I decided it made more sense to just buy an external hard drive.

A few technical things that I find particularly frustrating:

The touch pad is super sensitive, which actually ends up being a huge pain in the ass because just having your thumb hover over the touch pad constantly causes the computer to jump to wherever your curser happens to be on the page.  Not exactly a huge deal but if you aren't paying attention you type whole sentances in the middle of your paragraph so it can be annoying.

The shift bar is really small and that is a GIANT inconvenience because you instead hit the page up button at the same time, which selects all the text between where you are typing and the top of the page, resulting in you deleting the entire page of typing.  I can't even begin to imagine how much time I have wasted because of this.  This could have been remedied by Asus getting rid of the right Fn key (does anyone even use this?!) and shifting the page up key over 1/2 inch, since there is another Fn key on the left of the keyboard.

The two-finger scrolling takes a lot of time to get used to and it only works about 80 or 90% of the time.  Also, it's really easy to accidentally resize the page.  I am sure this is a feature that could be kindof cool if you got the hang of it but I haven't gotten to that point so I find it pretty obnoxious.

The final kicker though, and what motivated me to write up this review, is that my battery life has gradually decreased to the point that it lasts only about 4-5 hours.  When I first got the computer I could get around 10-10.5 hours on the ""balanced"""" plan- not exactly as high as it was advertized at but I knew that to get such a long life out of the battery you had to do a bunch of configuring with the power settings and I had access to power most of the time so I was pretty satisfied.

"Overall, this is an excellent choice if you need a lightweight portable laptop. It offers great battery life, a reasonably powerful processor, and ASUS reliability. System feels solid and has excellent build quality. The webcam works fine, and it's fast enough for my daily business and software development tasks. My only gripes thus far? The system comes with a good bit of junkware. It's partitioned with an 80gb system partition, and the rest for data. I wanted to start fresh so I had to find a Windows 7 x64 Pro install disk, repartition, and install the drivers/tools I needed. (The product activated fine with the product key sticker on the bottom of the system.)  It has HDMI, but no eSATA port.  Lastly, it's common to have the cursor jump while typing due to brushing the touchpad, but I fixed this problem after installing the touchpad driver and tweaking the settings.

"One of the best notebooks I have bought so far. I was looking for something small and light and this one was just right. I use it primarily for watching movies on Netflix while playing poker. Of course I have it connected to bigger monitor for the movies. This laptop is quite inexpensive.

ASUS is famous for manufacturing quality motherboards hence it would make more sense to buy a laptop from them.","['good notebook', 'small light', 'movie netflix play poker course', 'big monitor movie laptop inexpensive asus', 'famous manufacture quality motherboard sense']"
"Purpose of the Computer
General purpose activities such as browsing, word processing, reading emails, college work, occasional game, or occasional software development.

Some Defects:
I have owned this laptop for a year and a quarter. (Laptop was manufactured in August of 2010) Overall the laptop has performed well, but there are some problems and some design defects. First, the keyboard is not the best of quality as after several months of use the v key broke which I had to fix using superglue. Also, the keyboard flexes constantly, but the flexing is not too much of a problem. The next problem is the screen. The screen is not reinforced enough against pressure, and the spacers are less then adequate, as the screen will touch the keyboard. Because of this design defect with the screen, my screen as sustained damage and now has two pressure marks left on the LCD in the center of the screen. Lastly, the hot key software provided by Asus is not the greatest and has locked up on me several times forcing me to manually restart the process. However, I have found the software to be stable if the hibernation or standby features of Windows 7 are not used.

Some issues:
The screen will flicker when connected to the ac after using the battery. This issue can be fixed by unplugging the laptop and then plugging the laptop back in. Additionally, there is no easy access to the fan duct making it impossible to clean dust out of the computer without voiding the warranty.

The Verdict
I am overall pleased with the laptop, but am only giving the product three stars as my former laptop, a Dell Inspiron E1405, had none of these problems. Additionally, the Inspiron had covers which allowed access to the fan duct for cleaning, a feature I consider important.","['purpose computer general purpose activity', 'word processing', 'email college work', 'occasional game', 'occasional software development defect', 'own laptop year quarter laptop manufacture', 'august overall laptop', 'problem design defect keyboard good quality month use key', 'fix superglue keyboard', 'problem problem screen screen reinforce pressure spacer', 'adequate screen touch keyboard design defect screen screen', 'damage pressure mark', 'lcd center screen', 'hot key software', 'great lock time force', 'restart process', 'stable hibernation standby', 'windows issue screen flicker', 'ac battery issue fix unplug laptop plug laptop', 'easy access fan duct', 'impossible clean dust computer void warranty verdict overall', 'product star laptop dell inspiron problem', 'access fan duct']"
"I've been using the laptop for nearly a month and have been very impressed with the balance of performance, battery life, size, and weight.  It runs all my applications without trouble.  I use it primarily as a website development machine.  I can have my entire XAMPP development environment loaded, including Eclipse, MySQL, Apache, and Photoshop without it slowing down at all.

The keyboard and trackpad are easy to use and the screen is great.  I don't have any trouble seeing the screen in bright light.  I can go for hours on the battery; I have yet to run out of power despite a couple weeks of constant traveling and usage, including time in the airport and up to 4 hours on the airplane.

The only two problems I've had are with the internal fan and the speakers.  When I updated my system drivers the fan was very noisy and wouldn't slow down at all - even though the laptop wasn't at all hot.  I had to go back to an earlier driver to fix it.  The speakers are also very quiet - which isn't that big of a deal to me as I generally use headphones anyway.

Overall a great product.","['balance performance battery life size weight run application trouble use', 'website development machine', 'entire xampp development environment load', 'eclipse mysql apache photoshop', 'slow keyboard trackpad', 'easy use screen', 'great trouble', 'bright light hour battery run power', 'couple week', 'time airport hour airplane problem', 'internal fan speaker update system driver fan noisy', 'slow laptop', 'driver fix speaker', 'headphone overall', 'great product']"

"I bought this laptop in end of July and started using it in August and so far I am glad that I made the purchase though it does crash in almost all the games once you push the Anti-Aliasing over x4 which sux because I expected more perfection from this laptop but nothing is perfect!
I had some issues with the sound card too in the beginning but problem was solved after updating the driver and the reason why I got the problems is because I re-partitioned the hard drives and installed win7 ultimate on it which runs really good at it.

"At first, I was confused when I looked at product description. There is no different between G73JH-A1 and G73JH-A3. I made a decision to purchase G73JH-A3 anyway. I bought it via one business delivery, and it was delivered last night. I found that the spec of G73JH-A3 is different from G73JH-A1. G73JH-A3 has

1 8G 1333 MHz Memory, not 1033 MHz.
2. Yes, A3 has 4G SSD. You can select  statup applications by FastBoot utility  and it boosts up the Windows 7 startup speed a lot.

I am a programmer more than 30 years and I used more than 40 notebooks. Recently, I ordered Dell Studio 17 but Dell could not deliver it on time and  I cancelled the order and purchased this G73JH-A3. The ASUS quality is much better than Dell, I guess. My other notebook, Dell Studio XPS 1640 has many troubles for me and I fixed it several times.

This notebook is perfect to me, because I develop applications by Java, and I need memory and hard disk space. I am using Windows 7 and Ubuntu 10.04. G73JH-A3 works well at both OS.

When I setup G73JH-A3 today, it was crashed several times. Specially, when I played MS media player, it was always crashed. I set TDT at bios disabled and it is now O.K or upgrade bios to version 209.

I am very satisfied with this notebook. G73JH is not only a gaming machine. It supports my development a lot. Also, it looks like a normal notebook(At least, front look). I could use it at my office.

Good:
  1. Nice quality, good keyboards, sound and display
  2. Many Asus utilities to customerize configuration.
  3. Good price

Bad:
  1. Where is express card slot? G73JH does not have it. I could not use my sound blaster express card.
  2. Touchpad is useless. The buttons are too firm to press.
  3. Old fashioned battery (8cell) - 12 cell recommended. It could make half hour longer life without external power.
  4. I hope that G73JH will have audio control buttons on the top. Sometimes, I will use this notebook at office, and audio buttons are recommended.
  5. Lack description at manuals: Yes, I know what they are without explanation. I am a programmer. But, the manuals does not explain manythings(VT-d, TDT, UEFI boot or PXE ROM). Normal people don't know them and they could not find any information from ASUS web site.

"I am on my 5th service return for this laptop.  The last 3 are for the same issue--they keep returning the laptop even though the issue is unresolved and trivially reproducible.

"Initially, I am very happy with this machine. It is truly a great desktop replacement. That is said, I did have to return it twice, first time the DVD/Blu Ray drive was not working properly, PowerDVD used to freeze and I have to force shut it down, but Amazon sent a replacement within 6 hours and within two days I got the new machine. 2 days later I realized that I have one did pixel on the screen, for that I had to get an RMA and return it to ASUS to replace the screen. For about 4 months everything was perfectly working fine. I use this computer for gaming in addition to real work. I played COD modern warfare 2, GTA 4 and Assassin Greek and Resident Evil 5. You can get the same specs from Dell/Alienware for about $2700, while I bought my ASUS from Amazon for $1842. And I love the screen, it is an amazing HD and great quality picture.

After six months of owning the laptop a new problem has appeared. The video card (GPU) overheats when playing games for more than 30 minutes. After 30 minutes the laptop shuts down due to high temperature. I did some research and I realized that the laptop GPU idle temperature should be around 55C, while mine was in the range 75-80C. While gaming the temperature should be around 75-85C, while mine exceeds 100C all the time and it reaches the maximum allowed temperature 114C then the computer shuts down. I have to wait 5 minutes for the computer to cool down then turn it on again. The fans on the laptop are always on high speed, specially the one next the video card.

I have to RMA it again. One expects that such product to be thoroughly tested since it is a gaming laptop.

"Revised review:

If you like the Asus netbooks, it's a nice idea to have pay as you go mobile broadband built in.

My first review (12/7/10) was one star because the DataConnect Pass would not activate and nobody at AT&T would do anything about it. First level tech support did not seem to be aware the product existed. So I contacted Asus. Whatever they did, it works now (12/17/10).

He just kept chanting ""we do not support 3G"""".  He said maybe I didn't have the right SIM card in my computer.  He said I should contact Amazon.  He said no one there could help me.

"I have only had this laptop for a few days, and I absolutely love it.  I have to disagree with the other review that says that the keyboard is small and flimsy.  As a full time student who spends a lot of time typing, the keyboard was one of the most important features to me when comparing laptops.  The keyboard on this Asus is very comfortable, comparable to the keyboard on the Mac Powerbooks.  And I love having the number pad!  I guess it all depends on what you're used to. I'd also like to comment that the laptop looks great.  From the photos it looked pretty plain, and I was worried about being dissapointed by it because I was looking for something stylish.  In the end I chose Asus' reputation as being reliable over the style of some other laptops I was considering.  When I recieved my Asus I realized that it was the best of both worlds--all the reliability and components I wanted, and really sharp looking too!  I'd recommend the Asus K50IJ to anyone based on my experiences so far.","['laptop day', 'disagree review', 'small flimsy time student', 'lot time', 'laptop keyboard asus', 'comfortable comparable keyboard mac powerbooks', 'comment laptop look', 'great photo look', 'dissapointe look stylish end', 'asus reputation', 'reliable style laptop', 'recieve asus', 'good world reliability component', 'sharp look', 'asus ij base experience']"

"Bought my Asus K50IJ in January 2010, so I've been with it for a while. Mine has the older T6600 (Core 2 Duo) processor, but according to some research it is almost identical to the T4500 in this model. I use my computer several hours per day, mostly on the Internet, and I have been very pleased overall. Here are some of the things I've observed:

Positive: excellent style and all around feel. Processor, hard drive and RAM are more than adequate for any good laptop - in fact, a 500 GB hard drive is extremely rare for this price. The computer is much cooler than other models, as Asus says. Battery life is good to excellent. Keyboard is OK overall; more about that later. The one year damage replacement warranty was a strong selling point with me. Haven't had any experience at all with Asus support; though I'm told its excellent. Facial recognition login works quite well most of the time, depending on light, and is a much easier way to log in. SD card reader is conveniently placed (front center) and simple to use to DL photos from my camera or cell.

Negative: first, using the keyboard with the touch pad is insanely aggravating. It is impossible to type rapidly without my palms bumping the touch pad now & then, and when that happens the cursor is repositioned and I begin typing somewhere else. (Yes, I have tried every imaginable setting for the touch pad.) This happened constantly and was VERY aggravating, so of course I began to use a wireless mouse 99% of the time - thankfully I can set it to ignore touch pad input when it is plugged in. But every now & then I like to use the computer without the external mouse. According to the settings I chose, it should automatically begin responding to input from the touch pad when I unplug the mouse - but no such luck. The last few times I've unplugged the mouse, it refused to respond to touch pad input, so I had no control at all until I plugged in the mouse again. Also, several times I have plugged in the mouse after using the touch pad, and the touch pad refused to stop responding. In each of these cases I had to do several reboots to clear up the problem. Consequently I no longer attempt to use the computer without the external mouse - too much hassle. I feel this is a major issue, and prevents me from awarding this computer the five stars it would otherwise earn.

Another issue that is the computer must be handled very gently. I bumped it a couple of times when it was new, and heard a weird mechanical clicking inside, and the screen froze. I had to do a hard reboot. Obviously I handle it like an egg now, but it seems a laptop should be able to handle a few minor bumps without any issues. That is certainly true with the last one, which is now 6 or 7 years old.

As to layout design - the keyboard is not all that user friendly, as the advertisement implies. Response is less than stellar - often while typing rapidly I will hit a key and not get any response - so I have to back up and re-type. If you do a lot of typing, this could be an issue for you. In addition, the arrow keys are oddly placed - wedged between the number keys and alpha keys. This computer replaced an older IBM x-31, which, although admittedly IBM's top of the line premium business model, had a wonderfully responsive keyboard compared to this one. I could easily ""blind type"""" on the IBM with few errors. The lack of dedicated volume keys is a problem as well.

"I bought this for my daughter who is going to college.  I reviewed a lot of laptops and learned that Asus is the number 1 brand for reliability which is important to me.  It runs very well - I like Windows 7 and it has enough RAM.  My 2 dislikes are both with the keyboard.  First it offers the number keypad portion like a full sized keyboard.  This is great, BUT it ends up making the keys smaller than normally and I can't type worth a darn with the smaller keyboard keys.  It's really frustrating.  Second is the keyboard has a really flimsy feel - when you hit a key the entire area of keyboard around of the key mushes down.  Just makes it feel really flimsy.

Cons: Nothing major/serious.

Some minor cons: Glossy screen and frame can collect fingerprints and dust (but that can easily be cleaned from using Windex or an alternate friendly cleaning product). Minor bloatware to deal with (which can be easily uninstalled with out struggle using Ccleaner or a similar program)

"Had the 1016P for a few months now. I travel to Europe frequently and it is the computer that goes with me. I have a couple of Lenovo's (510/520) but they do not have near the battery life and are huge in comparison. I added a small (64GB)SSD and still have room for 12-15 movies. The battery life seems better with the SSD, but I do not have any hard data on how much it is extended over the spinner.

"I just recently purchased this little Asus for my wife to use. It came pre-loaded with Windows 7 and because the 1016P-BU17-BK is new from Asus, it came loaded with lots of goodies, like 3.0 usb, a faster and more reliable processor, standard with 2 mg ram and Win 7. I also own a Asus PC 1000 I've used for three years and this new netbook has a much better look and the keyboard is much more solid than what I have on my 1000. The 1016 seems thinner and lighter and although it is lacking the SSD like my 1000, it boots up just as fast and shuts down fast also.

"I am so pleased with my netbook. I did a lot of research before I decided to buy this one. I manage a Cafeteria & wanted something that would be smaller & lighter in weight to use than my currant laptop. This one is perfect for me. It has enough ram & storage for all my work. Of course the screen is smaller than your normal laptop, but I love the fact the battery last so much longer then my currant (Toshiba) laptop. Never have a problem with finishing what I need to do on it before I need to recharge the battery. This is what mattered the most to me. Info stated 13 hrs. of battery; I typically get 10-12 hrs. with no problems. My Asus EE comes with 2GB Ram, 320 Hard drive, plus Windows 7 Professional. Don't fool with buying a netbook & upgrading the ram and adding Windows 7. This guy comes with everything ready to go on it. The outside case is great too, you don't have to worry about fingerprints.

Also the sound is so quiet I have to plug in speakers to hear people when I am talking on Skype or listening to music.

"This is a very good laptop at this price. The laptop is loaded with a lot of features some of them are only found in high-end machines. I would particularly like to point out the i5 processor and the solid-state hard drive. Add that to the 8GB RAM and it makes this a lightning-fast machine for any work. It has a high-resolution screen and a pretty decent battery life. The laptop comes with Windows 10 Pro pre-installed. It is very light in weight and you don’t even feel the weight in the backpack.

It also has a touchscreen and fingerprint scanner. Although for me they are not of much use and seem like a marketing gimmick. But some people may like to have these features.

The only regret I have is that the 8GB DDR4 Ram is soldered to the board and hence there is no possibility of upgrading the Ram even if you want to.

Other than this, it is a great laptop and comes at a low price. I would surely recommend it.",
"This is a great laptop for the person looking for an ultra portable powerful laptop.  The laptop is big enough with a 14"" touch LCD to see all your web pages clearly, but its so compact and light you will never know your packing a laptop in your bag.  This thing is light.  It is so light and thin it makes easy to stow away in small compartment of my luggage.  The only bad thing is I am afraid it may break while in my bag.  The performance of the laptop is so worth it.  Fast Solid State Drive and 8GB of Ram makes this an easy speed demon.  The Intel Core i5 is powerful and can handle everything I asked it to do. I would say this laptop would be a competitor to the Lenovo Yoga, or Dell XPS.  I am very impressed with the battery life with this laptop as well.  Love this little machine.",
"There's a lot to like in this little package.  Here are some quick thoughts and observations from the last month.

Pros:

1) Easy set-up.  One thing you'll immediately note is how easy the Acer TravelMate is to set up.  My teenage daughter intercepted this before I got home and was happily checking her school email within 30 minutes with no assistance from me.
2) Responsive components.  The full-size keyboard is nicely responsive and feels very natural when typing.  The mouse pad is the same and a huge step up from our Chromebook.  The backlit keyboard not only looks cool, it is very handy when typing in low/no light.
3) The processor is decidedly adequate for non-gaming-specific uses.  While not lightning fast, it's by no means sluggish when navigating web applications (including games), word processors, etc...  We can have multiple applications and windows open without noticeable lag.
4) The hard drive IS lightning fast, saving and loading remarkably quickly.
5) The webcam is sharp and has been very useful lately with all the Zoom meetings.  (I verified this by hosting a meeting on another computer.  Again, the audio and video are a giant step up from our Chromebook.)
6) It's very light.

Cons:

1) The screen is a bit on the dull side.  The colors are not particularly vibrant.  If you're hoping to use this for movies/gaming, it's adequate but you'll might be underwhelmed.
2) Norton comes pre-installed.  If you've had that on any PC, you know how much of a pop-up headache (and how darn-near impossible to uninstall) it is.  (Ugh!)
3) Glitchy Google Chrome.  Can't explain why but we cannot use this computer's Chrome browser.  It is constantly asking for parental permission for use, which we've repeatedly granted through my Google account.  It was so frustrating we did a factory reset and reinstalled Chrome with a different account attached.  Same result.  Now we have to use Explorer.  (Shiver!)
4) The touch screen isn't great.  Feels like an unnecessary expense, too, since we navigate almost exclusively without it.
5) It's very light. Listed as both a pro and a con.  The pro side should be obvious.  On the con side, it has me thinking this unit needs to be cared for with kid gloves.  It doesn't reek of sturdiness.  I'm not saying its wimpy (I'll post an update if something remarkable happens one way or another) but it kind of feels that way.

Overall, I'm very pleased with this unit.  Everything feels decidedly ""adequate"".  There are better ""value"" options out there for those who don't want to spend this much, but if you're looking for a satisfying and functional laptop for work or school, this is a solid choice.",
"My laptop does light video and audio editing, lots of desktop publishing, and web browsing, often at the same time, which has been a problem with some laptops I've had.  This one handles it well with no lags or hiccups (two MS Office apps, 8 browser tabs, Premiere Elements all at once).  The screen is sharp with warm colors that pop.  The 3 USB ports (2 3.1 and 1 USB-C) handle a backup drive and USB hub with no issue.  I really love that this has a full size HDMI port on it so I don't have to waste the USB-C port on a video cable.  The keyboard is also identical (1/2"" less wide) to a full-sized external keyboard, so typing is easy and feels good.  However, because it is smaller laptop, there is no extra number pad and the Insert/Delete/Home/End/PageUp/PageDown keys do double duty with some others.  However, the Fn key does turn some of the keys into a number pad (Fn+F12 [NumLk]) so you can get a true number pad on this.  The keyboard is also backlit with a white light so typing in dark places is no problem.  Acer did maximize space and you can see that this is significantly smaller than a 15.6"" laptop (first pic) in size and is just under 3/4"" in height at its thickest.  It is made of a material that feels like a hard plastic but is super lightweight (just over 2 lbs.).  The WiFi has great reception and is speedy.

Two notes.  The back is attached with about 11 hex screws (0.8).  I tried to see if its was upgradeable but the back also seems to be glued on as well and didn't pop off after the screws were undone.  I always run an external drive anyway so not a problem, but this may be a consideration for some.  There is no memory card slot either, which seems to be more and more common now with cloud storage, but my hub solves that issue for me as well.  I'm still getting used to this but so far have no complaints.",
"Acer's TravelMate X514-51 has been an awesome piece of equipment – especially during this time of working from home. Powerful, fast, and extremely light – weighing in at 2.16 pounds. It’s almost like carrying a manila folder. This is mainly due to its magnesium alloy composition, giving it the look and feel of a plastic hard shell case. It’s so light that you might even forget you have it in your carry-on – so be careful!

Like most laptops, it opens to 180 degrees and had touchscreen capability. The lid comes with a slightly raised Acer logo. You get a 14-inch 1080p display (Full HD) with good touchscreen responsiveness. You also get a screen cleaning cloth to keep things clean. The webcam is located at the top of the screen. You’ll have to provide your own privacy cover. Speakers are on the bottom on the unit. I don’t use it for gameplay, so there’s no real benefit to great speakers for business purposes. If anything, the headphone jack provides the necessary means for sound should it be needed.

The keyboard is full-size and sits above the trackpad. The trackpad is one piece (no separate buttons for left/right clicks), but it does offer the left/right click capability in the pad. You just have to make sure your fingers are hitting on the right spot. To the right of the trackpad is a fingerprint sensor for security. During setup, you’ll be walked through the steps to establish this option by recording your fingerprint, similar to that used on the iPhone.

Inside is the Intel Core i7-8565U. This does just fine for me speed-wise. You can get into clock speeds and comparing GHz differences, but I had no delays with several apps open, along with PowerPoint, Excel, Word, and the Firefox browser open. The most common RAM in laptops is 8GB. Here you get 16GB RAM, which makes for great performance when multi-tasking. The TravelMate also comes with 512GB SSD.  I’ve learned to use an external hard drive, but this is a decent amount of storage nowadays and I use it as my back up. The battery life clocked in around 6 hours and took about 45-60m to recharge.

As far as ports go,  you get two USB type A ports, an HDMI port, a standard 3.5 mm headphone jack, a USB type C port (I use this for an external hard drive), and a Kensington lock. I’ve never used a Kensington lock, but if you’re using your computer in a public place and want to prevent someone from swiping it if you step away, it’s something to consider.

Overall – 4 ½ stars overall. Great performance, a super light but secure design, and a system that doesn’t run hot. Very impressive!",
"Overall, this is a solid laptop for the price. Acer has never been my favorite brand but they do seem to offer some of the best value laptops if you cant afford something more high end. The laptop is unbelievably light. I’m used the my Lenovo Thinkpad (work station) and I feel like I still use way too much effort to pick it up, sort of flnging it up and back down again unintentionally. One concern I have is that it sounded like there is something loose in the laptop since the day I got it and I’ve yet to open up the body and find out what it is. When I picked it up, I could hear something moving around in it and I think it finally got stuck somewhere because I’m not hearing it anymore. I don’t love the keyboard, it definitely takes some getting use to how flat it is and the spacing feels a little uncomfortable. If you’re not switching between numerous laptops and keyboards, you’ll probably get used to it and rarely notice it again. For me, it feels a little unnatural and the depth of the keys feels strange. I’m sure some of this is a product of being such a thin laptop. The great thing about though is that I can fit it in any of my backpacks, even my smaller ones without issue. It’s more compact and lightweight than my Mead notebook. It’s also faster than my other computers (my more powerful work stations) but that may just be a product of being brand new. The display is nice, a little more vivid and crisp than my slightly older laptops. It was also packaged pretty well. The packing wasn’t anything too crazy, not foam or buffer padding in the box which initially scared me but it was very secure in the laptop product box. It’s hard to say exactly how well it will hold up over time but so far it seems to be a pretty good value for what you get factoring in the size. I’d recommend looking at one in person first before deciding (or check the return policy) It’s a good laptop but I feel a little awkward typing on it so I only ever use it when I’m on the go/ working outside of the house or office. I'll update again in the future as I continue to use it.

The fingerprint sis bait doesn’t work. Maybe that’s what the rattling sound was when I received it. Either way, it’s annoying that new product has features that are either physically damaged in the body of the laptop or just straight up don’t work.",
"I wish I were a little more computer savvy, so that I could give you all the statistics and specifics about this Acer TravelMate x5 Thin & Light Business Laptop, that most people want to hear. Just know that I've been using a computer, almost daily, for more than twenty-five years. I know what I like, and what works for me. I needed a computer that could be used for our new family business. Mostly used at home, but could be packed up and used on site. This Acer TravelMate seems to be exactly what I needed. It's very light, weighing in at just a little over two pounds. At fourteen inches, it could easily fit into most of the purses that I carry. ( Okay, who am I kidding? Any chance to buy a new bag - I'm all IN!) With up to ten hours of battery life, it's very portable. I can go all day without having to worry about plugging it in, and tangling with cords. The initial start up, was so easy! Cortana, your virtual assistant, created by Microsoft for Windows 10, walked me through the process, every step of the way. This Acer TravelMate has Windows 10 Professional, which was created for advanced users and small businesses, who may appreciate the advanced features, such as encryption, Remote Desktop, assigned access and more. Further bolstering your security, this computer has the Acer Bio-Protection Fingerprint Solution. All very useful features for many, who have concerns about the security of their computers, and it's contents.
 I mentioned that it's small, at only fourteen inches. I have to tell you, I've owned a couple of tablet computers, and I found that with them, that smaller space ALWAYS meant a sacrifice of typing area, and function keys. I don't find that to be true with the Acer TravelMate. I'm more inclined to use the computer's calculator for math, and I don't miss the additional numerical keypad, at all. I LOVE the backlighting! It automatically dims down, when you're not actively using it, and with my fading eyesight, it helps me to FIND all the function keys. The HD screen is gorgeous, so crisp and clear. Frankly, it was the first thing that I noticed about this computer. It's stunning! The more I use this Acer TravelMate, the more I love it. I haven't had a whole lot of time for recreational moments, on this computer yet, but the few shows I've put on, and videos that I've watched, play well, and look and sound great.  I feel like I'm not sacrificing anything, and loving all the ""new to me,"" features. Because it's billed as a laptop, I'd be remiss if I failed to point out a feature, that some might find problematic. If you use it AS a laptop, ON your lap, with sound, the speakers are on the bottom of the computer. This seriously muffles the sound. It sounds best on a solid, hard surface. This Acer TravelMate meets all my expectations, and I've become reliant on features that I didn't know I needed. Every day I'm discovering new features that delight me, and I'm finding, invaluable.",
"Pros:  Light, Powerful i7, 16 GB Memory, SSD, Power Delivery USB-C, Win 10 Pro
Cons:  Video Card Slow, but good for light stuff, HDMI is 1.4 not 2.0 so it can't push 4K at 60Mhz (the USB-C/DP) can.  Fingerprint scanner is hit or miss, mostly miss.

I got the laptop around $750.00 so it was a steal for me but at $1000 you might want to check out the HP Envy x360 13 AY0021NR with the Ryzen 7.  Faster processor, faster video card, .  Ryzen 8 Core, with great video card. Gorilla Glass.

Great functionality and really fast on uploads/downloads. A great price. I will buy more Amazon Renewed products in the future. I am quite impressed.,
"I ordered through Amazon and received it 2 days later. So far, I’m pleased. It synchronized with all of my google stuff. My docs & photos that are on my phone are also on the HP 360 Chrome which is very cool. I did have to power off then back on because my sound cut out . I it was an app notification that started the issue but honestly can’t say. After I restarted the 360 it’s been fine ever since. I basically will be using it to surf the web, produce & save documents, send emails every now and then and stream movies. Having the USB type C ports are like icing on the cake. Already ordered a 10’ type c to HDMI cord to stream movies to the tv in my RV. The touchscreen is great!! I unplugged it from the power for the day to see how long it will last. It’s been over 12 hours and the battery is no where near depleted. I haven’t been on it the whole time but a good amount of the day. Hope this review helps someone.",

"After a few months of use, the keyboard would freeze forcing a restart after which the same problem would occur over and over. I've had friends with similar issues with the Chromebook. Quality control may not be what it should be. Finally trashed it and bought an iPad and keyboard with which we are very happy.",
For some strange reason it developed a line in the screen which was weird in the right hand corner and the charger went bad after not even 6months of having it,
"Perfect!! Happy so far, the pictures listed showed the keyboard in black & also white, but mine is all white which I wanted.. Very happy, user friendly, touch screen & convertible from laptop to tablet. Awesome price, thank you",
So far this laptop is great. It does glitch depending on how often you transition from only touch screen. Also does not have all the keys and takes a little time to get familiar with functions since it’s not like a typical laptop,
Good,

Plus, its thicker than most so it's perfect for kids who generally toss them around a lot.  My son loves the touchscreen to use it as a tablet.  Highly recommended.",
Its a good entry level laptop for light gamers and students. I recommend getting a cooling pad and upgrading the ram as soon as you can. For gamers get an external keyboard if you're planning to play anything serious. Only had one problem and that was because windows updated the bios to an unstable version and bricked the system. Had to recover via bootable usb stick. Turn off all optional updates on windows 11.,
"The Vivobook 15 is often compared and contrasted with the Acer Aspire 5. In my opinion the Vivobook is a far better choice!

The Aspire looks nice and performs decently, and the screen is great for the price. But inside, it feels really cheap, with the battery not actually even being fastened in place at all. And the RAM expansion slot in the one I got didn't work and Acer tech support was entirely unhelpful. I returned it.

By happy contrast, the Vivobook feels quite sturdy, almost like aluminum even where it's plastic, and the inside seems... not premium, but well built. And RAM installation (and SSD replacement) went smoothly. Great BIOS, too, the best I've seen.

Mine *did* come with a 2.5 inch hard drive expansion caddy and connector in the box, which is a nice touch.
I'm running Linux (openSUSE Tumbleweed) on it and it runs flawlessly. Just boot to BIOS and turn off Secure Boot and Fast Startup, then reboot to a USB flash drive with the installer for the distro of your choice.

I do think the Aspire has a somewhat better screen. But the Vivobook screen is still fine for the price; not the most colorful, but brightness is adequate and text and images are sharp and clear.

Very happy with my purchase!",
"It arrived at my house on March, 12. It looks good and I'm excited to have it. Few days after I found the issues with Caps Lock button sticky and stuck in hole I had to lift it up sometime by using my nail (the sound when I press it's totally different with others) the day after I can't use my finger print to access it.

I just use it in general work. I have had contact someone to help vis My Asus they said that I just bought it I should return to local reseller??? I live in New Zealand or I can send it to service center at my cost??? If I return to Amazon and get a new one, how I can know that issues won't happen again? It's not my fault at all 100% no damage from me.",
"I am okay with this laptop in most respects, but I am concerned that the display has poor contrast at most angles. I am looking at graphs online and literally can't see elements of the graph (they are so faint that they disappear) until I tilt the screen at just the right angle.",
"The specs on paper for this laptop were great but it was clear that some corners were cut and features missing, I'm guessing to get the price this low. My wifi signal was very weak in places where I didn't have problems with other devices. The USB charging doesn't go over 500mA. It will not charge your devices while you use them. Hardly. This was a feature in my last acer that I didn't know I needed.",
"Love my new computer  Am having a problem with games on Google Chrome crashing.  Have to completely shut computer down and reboot for it to work for a few minutes.  Probably a Chrome problem.  Hopefully, will figure it out.  My old laptop, which is basically falling apart, never/still doesn't have that problem, so am disappointed to have to deal with it on new laptop.  Love the lighted keyboard.",
This is very fast laptop. Best among its peers with 7nm processesor technology and expandable RAM.,
I'm very happy with this so far. Runs fast for what I need. The only thing I'd like to see is the speakers moved but that's minor for me.,
Price was right and Great Value.,
Feels cheap but works fine so far. Amazon Q&A suggested the keyboard has a backlight. There is no backlight.,
Excellent Quality and my Wife loved it.,
Ideal para estudiar,
Video Player is loading.,
"This laptop has everything I need. It's fast, very lightweight, and just perfect for the average user. Only little complaint I have is that the light on the caps lock key is so faint that I can barely see it. Highly recommend !
(Asus is giving me a 3 mo. warranty extension).",
Quit after 3 months of use,
This was well packaged and properly met my expectations.  Slightly bummed it needs a USB dongle for wifi but I knew I was getting a refurb.,
"These laptops are very well specified and great value, purchased for team, and do the job required of them",
I bought this laptop in February of this year and it no longer works!! I'm still paying for it and now it's not working. I'm not happy at all!! I can't afford to buy a new one seeing that I'm still paying for this one ??,
"I love it. This thing pops. Very fast. The wife has an I pad. Its good, but I like my Tab S better. I'm replacing an older 1.6g Toshiba laptop with this Tab S. Its 10 times faster than the laptop. Windows and all the popups swamp the laptop. I won't miss windows.",
A good product.I only wish that it lasted longer before recharging.,
cant get rid of the main screen which is cellular mobile,
"Great tablet. The screen is high resolution and looks wonderful with vivid colors. The tablet is very quick and can handle most tasks with ease. The Samsung software is refined and easy to use, for children or adults. Overall I am very satisfied with the purchase and I will be purchasing another soon.",
"Great functionality, but it takes an eternity to charge. Despite good battery life (3-4 days of moderate use), it takes 7-8 hours to acquire a full battery.",
I love this tablet. I use it mainly to read books and comics. I bought it with the intention of using it as a comic book reader and it fit the bill. The size and aspect ratio is the closest you'll get to having a tablet that resembles the dimensions of a physical comic.,
Very satisfied.  The only disappointment is that I can't download and/or watch movies from my Amazon Prime account.  I definitely WILL NOT be renewing my membership with Amazon!,
"Cannot begin to describe the delight, as well as the experience in ordering and receiving this tablet.  My first in entering the techo-geek world.  Now if I can keep my hands and eyes in the right place...as I am walking...just saying!",
"I needed a sensible platform for mobile editing and presenting photos and this fit the bill. I have a totally portable and efficient system. To round out the capabilities I also purchased:

Samsung 64GB EVO Class 10 Micro SDXC
Bobj Rugged Case
Inateck Multi-in-1 OTG Adapter
LinkS 10 feet Micro USB to HDMI MHL",
"I own an ipad and I used to be against what Apple does and want to try it out. Liked the look, fell. And thats it.

My main gripe is the performance is choppy. Sometimes the chrome browser doesnt respond; apps doesnt respond - I have to restart the tab.
Internet connection is also choppy. Never had these problems with the third generation ipad.

Another problem I have is some of the apps that my kids use are not supported on android - splash math is one such an app. JiJi math is another one. All in all, I wish I should have stick to ipad.",
Box seemed to be damaged slightly. Most likely from Fed ex. Other than that everything came as described and product worked perfectly. Tablet is amazing and the screen is oustanding.,
"got it in 2014, it still works, battery holds, SD card is must have",
"This is my third android tablet, and by far the best yet.  Very fast, rarely hesitates and handles everything I throw at it with ease.  Google earth, emails, pdf, spreadsheets, word docs.....all no problem.  I'm coming from an Asus tf300, and the tab s is leaps and bounds ahead.  Very satisfied.",
"Lovely clear screen. I need a keyboard for sure with this. It's a little slow though, especially with the internet. That's probably my biggest complaint about this tablet.",
Best tablet on the market right now. Replaces my laptop and is much lighter and better looking. I would recommend this tablet to anyone. Don't get an iPad. You can't really do school work or anything job related on one but on a galaxy tab s you can do just about everything a laptop does and its cheaper.,
Excellent product. There is literally no lag on this tab. Screen is super bright and UI is also smooth. It plays gta san andreas without any hiccups. Sound is also really good. Its an ipad killer for sure. Delivery of product by amazon was also quick. Recieved my product within 10 days in india. U will not regret the purchase.,
"This is a great tablet, we went with it because of the processor, my husband it knowledgeable about computers and he would not be able to stand a sub par tablet, so for the price I don't think you can do better.  I also thought the camera looks pretty great too.  We are really happy with this tablet.",
OMG! I love love love this tablet. It is replacing my iPad and so much nicer. I already had a samsung s4 phone and loved it so I knew when it was time to upgrade there was no question. I love that I can use an so card for expandable memory too. One of the biggest reasons I made the switch.,
The lower left corner of the glass is loose and moves away from frame when touched. The battery drains faster than an older IPad. The tablet freezes when touched on the lower right side of screen.,
"Item was advertised as new. It wasn't. There were some scratches along the edge of the tablet, but at least the screen was good. The tablet also seemed to be a much older version than what it was advertised as, and it's already taking a long time to charge up the battery. So all in all, I'm pretty sure I got hosed with this purchases, especially for the price I paid ($565+). Will never buy another electronic device off of Amazon again. It's far too risky.",
"Very clear screen than iPad, I added 256GB SD Card (Spend $50) and it works.  You can connect it to your smart TV with screen mirroring.",
"Battery drains when off more quickly than the iPad.  Don't put it down for several days and assume it still has a full charge.  It loses about 5-10% per day, depending on how many apps have remained open.",
"The Tab itself is pretty okay. But I miss a key feature: The available languages are limited to the common ones in the US/Canada, there is English (in 3 versions), Spanish (in 2), French (in 2), Chinese (in 2), but no other language. None of those is my natice tongue. You can also not load another language unless you root the tab. Samsung just shrugged to the issue.",
"I went back and forth between the iPad and the Galaxy until I saw them side-by-side.  The iPad was dull in color compared to the Galaxy.  I like the android platform as it fits in with my smart phone.  The Galaxy also has an SD slot which allows me to expand the storage, up to 128GB.  So far, not a bit of trouble.",
"Love this tablet...Especially since I can increase my memory just by buying a micro SD card and the split screen mode...Great value & easy to use.  I have no complaints so far...Those two details are what sold me on the Tab S instead of getting the Apple iPad Air 2.  I am an Apple fan, but this tablet was the right one for me.",
"Fast, better stability than previous models. Lots of features and potential. Miss S pen and screenshot button but otherwise can live without. Kit kat operating system is far superior to earlier operating systems. Noticing some wear on the gold edges so recommend a case if carrying with you outside of your home or office. Battery lasts all day using internet radio and doing email/Facebook etc throughout the day.",
"This is such a beautiful tablet...
I really like Samsung products...
I am very happy with my purchase, but I would just like to mention this tablet does not have a sim card slot... It is WIFI only...",
"I was looking for tablet computer, but I didn't want to pay the price for a major brand ""pad"". I like the Android operating system, as it works very similar to my Android smart phone. Battery life is great, and it works great on both wireless router bands. For the price, it has pretty good performance and features. I love my tablet and highly recommend it.",
"I forgot this was ordered from Amazon.com.  LOL  It came as promised, packaging was safe and secure.  I really like the tablet.  It meets all of my needs  and the large screenis great.  I especually like that I could add storage space and am able to use it as a remote.  BEAUTIFUL DISPLAY.  I  couldn't be happier.",
"I love this! It has exceeded my expectations and is so beautiful. I have not begun to use all of its capabilities. The only ""problem"" I have had was trying to use it in a car on an interstate.  It synced with my S3 phone just fine, but it got overwhelmed with a large download. I don't really consider that a problem, as it works well with the phone any other time.",
"I am so disappointed with this tablet. The one time I decide to buy a refurbished product on an expensive product, it was a fail! The tablet is slow at times, freezes, and closes apps randomly while using. I think the tablet would have been much better had I bought it factory new instead of refurbished. It is an extremely good looking tablet and the size is perfect for me.",
"At the time, this was the best Tablet out there as far as picture and camera go.  I'm still i love with the clarity of the picture.  This product is a year or 2 old so other more recent products may be better.  But, I highly recommend this particular tablet.",
"I absolutely love this tablet. I am a Samsung & Android fan anyway but because of this tablet, I havent turned on my laptop in months. There is no need for the laptop. I do everything on this tablet. I have the kindle app so I can read all my books. I have Amazon Prime,Netflix & Huluplus and this tablet streams well. Also the picture is beautiful. Between my Galaxy s5 phone and this tablet I am set.",
"This is the best tablet. Great colors, terrific photos, lots of wi-fi range. The down side is battery life. It needs to be charged every day. My wife has a Samsung tab 4 and gets 36 hours of run time compared to my 4 or 5.",
I've had the Samsung Galaxy Tab S 10.5 about 2 months now and I love it! It's very thin and the screen size is great. The only problem I've had so far is the screen was glitching when i first got it but it only happened a couple times and hasn't happened since. This is my first tablet so I can't compare it to others but it seems like it's a good one for the price range. I will update if anything changes.,
"Bought refurbished. I love my tablet. It's huge and beautiful. The only thing I have found wrong with it (probably because it is refurbished) is that the screen occasionally does not respond. In order to resolve this, I simply press the power button to turn the screen off, and then press to turn the screen on again. Bought a bluetooth keyboard case to go with it, and it pairs wonderfully.",
"I'll be honest -- I really liked the tablet when it worked.  Screen was excellent, but after 2.5 years, it completely stopped working.  Graphics and WIFI connectivity were excellent.  I had no trouble with that.

Where I did have trouble was that the battery would not charge or did not hold a charge.  Liking the tablet, I replaced the battery, after all a new battery was cheaper than a new tablet.  The new battery lasted abut a year before the entire unit failed.

After 2.5 years, the tablet is now dead and out of warranty. Yes, I admit I am a heavy user and Yes, I take my tablet everywhere, but I also take my phone everywhere and it is used or on standby 24 hours a day.",
"I like the android platform much better than IOS. Great upgrade from my ipad. My biggest issue is with the amazon instant video. If you are running kitkat, you need to download the amazon App Store, the amazon shopping app, then amazon instant video. If you use the amazon for tablet app the instant video will not work, you need the amazon for phone app for it to work properly. Wake up amazon and design a proper app like you did for kindle and ipad.",
I guess i did not see the part where it says used product . However it looks as good as new. The only issue I have noticed is the touch seems to be a little slow to respond sometimes.,
"Bought this as a replacement for another of the same model that I broke.  Works great, like new. 4 stars bc I was unaware it was a Verizon model",
"This handles most all my needs since I do more reading of info than actually typing info other than emails.  The on screen keyboard is easy to use and has good spacing for fat finger-types.  I put mine in a keyboard folder combo, but I find I would rather use the screen to type emails.  I don't need to write school papers or business briefs so the keyboard folder isn't all that useful to me.  It works well if you need it.",
"I purchased this to replace a Galaxy Tab Pro that was stolen.  It's definitely a stronger piece of tech.  The battery life has been much better.  It's very functional for video watching and I really appreciate being able to swap out memory cards(I'm looking at you Apple...).  I really appreciate being able to fill and edit PDFs directly on the screen, even being able to get signatures from clients on the spot.  It has become an indispensable tool for my business and play.",
"I love love love this tablet. The image quality is amazing. Long lasting battery. I take it with me wherever I go. I'm a first time tablet user. I is a lot of research in deciding which tablet to buy. While the iPad clearly gets a lot of great reviews, in testing out both products in a store I couldn't help like this tablet better. The image quality is so much brighter and very crisp. Like looking at the world through glass. I have zero complaints.",
Fantastic. I had to de-bloat it and tweak it a little and now it runs ultra-smoothly and the picture is amazing. It's easy to root and install custom kernels and roms (though there are not many to choose from. There are only a couple good roms and one good custom kernel) and the microSD slot is easy to use. I like that it has some empty space under the screen for me to hold while I'm watching a movie/video so I don't have to touch the screen.,
I love the tablet but it came with a small chip in the paint on the bottom and a black mark on the back near the camera and when i press down on the side near the charger port it feels like its loose and makes a crackling noise. Hope it doesn't get worse.,
I am seriously in love with this tablet. Words cannot describe how fantastic this thing is! The screen is SO BEAUTIFUL and everything looks amazing on it. It's nice and thin so it's not too heavy to hold while I'm doing something else. I don't know how people still remain interested in ipads when there are tablets like these on the market. Their eyes would be opened if they'd free themselves from the apple cult. Come to the dark side my fellow apple users. I promise it's not so bad over here ;-),
"I don't normally consider writing product reviews, however, given the price I paid ($399) and the measly 10 months it took for the LCD screen to go bad, I am motivated.  There was a 3 year warranty ($80) which I DID NOT signup for.  I believe that if the manufacturer is going to sell me a tablet at a $400 price point, the quality of the product should at least be of a high quality.  I tried to get the LCD screen repaired and was quoted almost $300 by two repair companies.  What made matters worse, was that this was my wife's birthday gift (which she seemed to have appreciated, while it lasted).  So here I am trying replace the product altogether.  May consider a different supplier, and brand altogether.",
"The item was poorly packed, but fortunately it wasn't damaged which is why it gets 3 stars.

As far as the product goes, it deserves 5 stars, simply amazing! Only negative is Google Chrome, laggy. I use Firefox or Opera with no problems.

Compared to my wives IPad Air 2, it has better screen clarity on a larger screen. It takes slightly better video and photos. The Galaxy S has more features. The IPad's processor and browser is faster. It all comes down to whether you prefer Android or Apples OS? You can't go wrong with either.",
"Got the Dazzling White Samsung S 10.5 factory sealed and I'm now a believer.
Amazing Device,Amazing PPI RESOLUTION and Amazing Picture Quality in my opinion,288 PPI that's really good,you can't distinguish the pixels almost at all,Very portable thin device Good sound speakers .
The seller sent it very fast
And now I am updating my Tablet to Android 6.0 and that gives it many many improvements and faster performance than before.
I'm a Happy Person",
"I love it. The graphics are astounding... much sharper than my IPAD 1. It was little difficult to navigate initially, but I am sure that I will master the functions shortly. I keep my tablet with me at all times. I use it for news, internet, Spanish lessons, music & photos. Although I have Apple desktop & lap top computers,  my tablet is my main source for computing because of portability.  I will keep my IPAD 1 for my grandchild's usage, but hands off my Galaxy S tab.",
"My husband has the iPad and now I have the Galaxy tab and let me tell you, he wants mine now! The graphics are so good, the price is right, and I love the feature that lets me sync my GalaxyS phone to it and it appears on the screen and I can use my phone through the tablet. Awesome! So easy to use, and I feel like I am using my phone on a much bigger scale because everything is exactly the same to change settings, etc. Love it! Great investment!!",
"Didn't realize I was being sent the store display tablet. When I received it, it was in store display mode and I had to do a ton of online searching to figure out how to get it out of that mode. Then after only using it for maybe a month or 2 the tablet has stopped being able to remain on while off of the charger. So, after while of only working on the charger, the tablet just stopped staying on for more than a minute even with being on the charger. The battery is clearly the problem since it was the display product which remains on the charger the entire day at the store, which damages the battery. The worst part about it was that there was no notice this was the store display product and no instructions or help to resolve any issues I might run into. If you're planning on buying this, make sure you check it isn't the store display product. Can't emphasize it enough. Other than this HUGE problem, the tablet is awesome and I would've given it a 5.",
I have owned and purchased every ipad and iPod available for myself and family. This tablet was quite a different purchase and I was very hesitant . In the evening I watch movies and TV shows and I was blown away with the stunning picture I saw on this devise. My Fire Kindle has a beautiful picture but I must admit this Samsung tablet was far more impressive. I would purchase this again in the future if anything happens to this tablet. I have only begun to learn the many facets and capabilities of this product.,
Its been day one that ive had this and well lets just say that although it is super thin it resists a fall from my kitchen table. I was scared once I picked it up from thw floor but then suprised when I saw not even a scratch on it! Overall its great the screen quality and size is perfect for me!,
"I bought this to replace a desktop PC that gave up the ghost. I LOVE THIS THING!! It's seriously faster than my ancient PC; the screen produces film & video images that are to die for; and with the bundled Hancom Office suite, it can do almost everything I could do with MS Office, but without paying a king's ransom to Microsoft every year for the privilege.

I'm a writer, so I need a computer & word processor that won't have me tearing my hair out.

The Samsung Galaxy Tab S (10.5 in) delivers. In spades.",
"Officially I am now an ex-Ipad user.  Wow, what a wonderful experience so far.  Set up was easy and this is someone who is not techical.  Movies are wonderful to watch on this tablet, which we use Netflix streaming.  Even the speakers are not bad, but can attach external speakers r to enhance the expereince.  I am impressed with thelightnesss, it is lighter than the Ipad air.  For now, this is a terrific tablet for the money.  And I can increase the memory.",
"This tablet has met our expectations and we have enjoyed using it.  The resolution of the screen is great and displays our photos and videos beautifully. Have been a little disappointed in battery life.  It seems to run down in a lot less time than advertised.  We don't travel far from an electrical outlet where we can recharge it, so it hasn't presented a great problem for us.",
I have had this tablet for around 5 years and I love it. It has great storage. I have over 40 apps and it runs perfectly. I use this tablet for work while i'm in meetings and i use at home for cooking recipes and to watch Netflix. I enjoy the sleek design and durability of this table. The screen size is very nice. Easy to charge. This product is very helpful in my daily life.,
"I ordered this on a Friday and had it on Sunday,  WOW. I was worried that I had gotten a refurb since it seemed the package was a bit worn but after inspecting and setting it up, I determined that Samsung did a less than stellar factory pack. Aside from this I would recommend this tablet to anyone. Got this on sale for over $100 less since the Tab S 2 is around the corner. The display truly is unlike any other,  perfect for movies.  I also got the Samsung book case cover in dazzling white.  Talk about a perfect combination.",
"I love my Tab S. I have a small business, and this tablet has helped me in ways a laptop never could. Its portable, its slim, its light and it feels like a high quality. I can easily remote into my work computer, do all the needed work I need to do, then watch Netflix or play games. The screen quality is amazing, the sound quality is amazing and overall I am very satisfied with this tablet.

Links very well with other Samsung devices. Some older bluetooth devices won't connect to this with the KitKat operating system, so that does suck. Do buy the Samsung book fold cover, it is worth it.",
"Wow, WOw, WOW!!! I have an iPad and Android smartphone, so not partial or biased to either. THIS lovely piece of technology BLOWS me away. The sound on the speakers is ENORMOUS, and you can have surround sound vs stereo, if you prefer. LOVE it! Oddly, I did NOT pay for express or overnight shipping. But I ordered it on Sat and it was on my doorstep on SUNDAY. You go, Amazon!!! You rock and this item is amazing. Thank you for our wide range of products, amazing customer service (who can say that now days?) AND return/protection policies. I can't live without my Amazon...well, why would you want to?",
"For the first in a while there is a device worthy of being a true competitor to the iPad. It's light, super thin, feels great in the hands and the screen is the best on the market. I was blown away by the depth of colours and how super sharp everything looks on this screen. Performance wise it's not bad and my only regret now is not buying the 32 GB as I am already grappling for space due to the Samsung bloatware.",
"I purchased this tablet as a gift for Christmas for my significant other.  He loves it!  I also purchased a keyboard case and protective shield for the touch screen.  He uses it everyday for music, games and checking weather and news.  When I purchased it, it was delivered as promised!  The packaging was sturdy and not damaged!  (I worried about that with the rush of Christmas deliveries by our carrier.)  The price was perfect!  I see many happy moments ahead as he uses it for his business as well as for capturing photos of the cabinetry that he builds!
A great gift!  I highly recommend this purchase!",
"Love it! Gorgeous tablet. I use it easy for youtube videos, Netflix, browsing the web, and reading. It's lightweight and easy to bring everywhere. I also love that it has vibrate notifications. Only thing I don't like is the battery life. I was told it could last 8-10 hrs but it lasts about 4 hrs on a full charge. Also, the takes about 7 hours to fully charged.  But overall I'm ecstatic with my purchace!",
"Bought this for my son to play with.  I have no complaints about brightness, responsiveness, battery life, or image quality and resolution. He uses it daily and loves it.  I'd provide a more thorough review if it was for my own personal use, but as things are, this was meant to serve as entertainment for a child and it is serving that purpose well.",
"I've had this tablet for almost 3 years and it's still going strong. The display is probably one of the best tablet displays I've ever seen, even now three years later thanks to the amoled tech. The storage space is low but with the expandable drive it's not too much of a concern. It would be nice if Samsung enabled adoptable storage so that you could use it system wide but they have yet to do so. It runs plenty fast, playing any 1080p video I have thrown at it. All in all I highly recommend this, even at three years old.",
"The ONLY negative trait I have found is that it takes a really long time to charge.  I've yet to find out if it supposed to take that long or if it is the charger that is malfunctioning.  If I power it off completely and charge it, it only takes a couple of hours.  I did get it used.

The tablet itself is what I had hoped for: lightweight, large screen, great resolution, decent price.  It operates very smoothly.",
"This is my first tablet. I received the 10.5"" Tab S about a week ago. I have not found one thing that I don't like about it. For media it's awesome. I am using it to learn piano, and I love putting a how-to video on one side with sheet music one the other side of the split screen. I use it to connect to my VDI for work, it's great there. I downloaded a database  app, that works great.
Everyone around me uses iPad devices and loves them. So finally I decided to try a tablet. I didn't really expect to love but I do. Everyone with iPad devices cannot believe the amazing screen and picture, and all of the great features.",
"Great tablet. Vivid color. This was our first tablet so we're still getting used to it, but so far so good. The only thing I'm not crazy about, (hence 4 stars not 5) is the phone software. I would like to see a more ""full service"" internet browser and software. As it is, it's just a big phone that you can't make calls on. But still, it's great for some apps. We're remodeling our house and it has been a great tool for pictures and list making, to be able to better communicate with the contractor.",
"This Samsung Galaxy S has a superior camera, fast CPU, and better screen resolution than more recent tablets.  The reason is that it was originally branded and subsidized by Veriz....., the phone company.  It was intended to have a cell chip and be on a cell plan but the cell company bought more than they could sell.  It works fine without a SIM chip on WiFi and the features and specs are better than unsubsidized tablets.  It's sold as refurbished but my appeared new.",
"Love the tablet but wish I was able to get the manual to go with it.  I have tried to copy it so that I can put it on my TV to look things up while
I am working on it.  No luck.  Having it on my computer is not convenient for me.  The tablet does so many things and I'm sure I will appreciate
it even more when I can get myself more familiar with it.  Have tried to buy the manual but it does not appear to be available from Samsung.",
I've been having this recurring problem for the past 6 months. My tablet is a little over 18 months old. My tablet will not turn on. I have diligently looked for articles on the internet and none of the proposed fixes work. I'm not sure if after 18 months I need to spend the money on a new battery. I'm wondering if anyone else has had this problem and what they have done besides holding the start button and the volume button down for 20 seconds at the same time because this does not work. Very disappointed. Other than this recurring issue I absolutely love my Samsung tablet. Unfortunately I am beyond the one-year warranty. I think this is a flaw and this should should be covered regardless of warranty,
"Giving this a one star based off performance alone.

I was originally extremely excited to receive the brand new Samsung tablet. I mostly use tablets for media consumption and web browsing. I read tons of reviews between various tablets and this one seemed to be the clear leader in the android space for a larger screen tablet which I really wanted over the ipad 2.

The user experience for this tablet is very sub par imo. I went back and forth on whether I should keep it and try and load a custom ROM but in the end I decided it would not be worth it, the tablet should work out of the box from a performance perspective.

Browsing is incredibly slow in side by side comparisons with my very old nexus tablet. I used several different browsers and all of them seemed like I was on a dial up connection with content rich websites. Dolphin browser seemed to be the best but I enjoy using Chrome and I shouldn't have to change my browser because of a hardware/software in a tablet. The screen looks good but at the same time the display driver doesn't seem to perform very well, scrolling and movement are often very jittery and don't appear to give a great experience. Some games performed well while others seemed almost blurry with movements.

I'm not a huge apple fan but I may have to go with an ipad 2, the nvidia shield looks to be my only other viable alternative. I'm really disappointed that this tablet didn't work out.

I would not recommend this product unless you've never used another tablet before and maybe don't know what you are missing.",
"Great tablet in almost every way, however, coming from an Ipad i was not able to adjust to the slight lags in the UI and the general lack of quality apps on the android market place. I used it for about a week before deciding to return and bought an ipad air. I dont understand why the liquid smoothness of the IPad UI is unattainable on such a powerful tablet.

If you are an android afficionado, this is just the tablet for you. I can imagine the performance once you root it and rip out the custom UI. Also, the additional SD card slot can go upto 128gb (you are stuck with whatever size Ipad you buy).",
"This tablet by far hands down is my favorite tablet it's very thin so it slides down into the outside pocket of my pocketbook. It is 10.5 so the screen is nice and large so when I'm watching movies i dont need my glasses. It's a little smaller than a regular size writing tablet,& thinner than the depth of a pencil. The battery last a lot longer than any other tablet or kindle I've ever had! Someone stole one of mine, so I have now bought 2 refurbished tablets that were backed by Amazon. One I have had for a year this one I just got they all work great I am debating by a third one before they're not available anymore",
"Came with two fine scratches on the screen, but for two hundred bux, that's acceptable cause I knew it wasn't new, I needed something to binge watch netflix with while in bed, without it being too heavy as to cause significant trauma if dropped on my face. Plus I don't want it to be too expensive where I had to be so gentle with it, this was perfect, right between my S7 and IPadpro (productivity tablet). My only fear was that they would send me a non working tablet whereby I would have to pay a restocking fee as some kind of hot potato like scam. Happy with purchase and with seller as well.",
"I love this tablet.  I read all the complaints about the Samsung Galaxy S 10.5, and bought it anyway and I was right.  This is the tablet for me.  Super light, adds almost no weight to my bag for work.  Allows USB Flash drives with micro usb adapter/plug.  Charges pretty fast and contrary to what you may read, KEEPS AN EXCELLENT CHARGE for quite a while.  Also has the most beautiful screen ever and very simple to use.  Like my previous Samsung item, the Galaxy s3 phone, I am very happy with everything about it.

Some things to consider:  hard to find a case that you like.  I've already purchased two and both are ""eh.""  That's likely because it's new right now; the companies I usually purchase from for cases haven't really gotten around to making one yet.  One other little pesky thing is that the icons are HUGE and they don't adjust.  Other than that....a great tab.",
"Got this for Mary after complaints of the 1st generation iPad being too slow or lack of functionality. She didn't like this tablet at first but the speed of old versus new tech over time negated this complaint. The Android interface wasn't that much of an issue after awhile. Both the ipad and android can be an issue getting photos and videos to and from a PC, but for the most part it's simple with a bit of searching.

The only thing Mary complained about was the lack of battery life. I wished they made these tablets a bit thicker in support of the LiPro bats they put in them.

Ended up throwing this away for a Galaxy Tab Pro as the glass on this one shattered in the car's door jam--Oops!",
"I bought this used, or at least at a used price. It came in new condition! God I love Amazon and their sellers! I sold my Ipad air so I could buy this. No regrets at all! It was like traiding in a 1976 Ford Pinto for a new Mustang! Ipads are just so darn limited IMO. Not as limited as a Kindle Fire HDX ""Sorry Amazon"" ! Samsung just destroys the competition! You can just do so much more with an Android. Anyway, if you're gonna plop down between four and six hundred dollars on a near ten inch tablet with no limitations, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S 10.5 is the way to go. Why buy a tablet for that kind of money like the Kindle or the fruit when they can't even do half as much? Not to mention the display and the speed of the Galaxy Tab S blow the other two away! As far as other specs, The Galaxy Tab 4 blows the Kindle and fruit away as far as what you can actually do with them.",
"I've has this tablet for about 6 weeks now.  The only beef I have is that the fingerprint reader is crap. I had to do a hard factory reset to remove the print I scanned in because  after the first scan it would not recognize the print any longer.  Unfortunately I found a story about the Tab S being the perfect tablet EXCEPT for the old fingerprint scan technology used.  Samsung has a superior fingerprint interface that is used on their Edge phones... Grr.  The tablet is brilliant and beautiful.  The battery life is great.  Lots of features I don't use and would like to eliminate but can't...like the page layouts.  I have big blank blue boxes in places because I don't want certain  hardwired apps appearing on my screen.  I'm a lite user mostly games,  news and email.",
"I have an Android phone but this is my first experience with a Android tablet/computer. I'm used to Microsoft and i use MS Word and Excel a lot. I  wanted a downsized laptop so I thought this wpuld be a great solution: wrong, wrong wrong. I tried to make it work but after three months I'm finally giving up. There isn't much wrong with the tablet itself, but the Android operating system is a royal pain if you try to do anything serious with it.

First of all, most of the ""apps"" (similar to the Android phone apps) that you download are dumb downed and are missing a lot of important features. First example is banking. Basic stuff with Wells Fargo worked OK but when I wanted to download an old statement it would not work no matter how long I talked to the bankers. Second example is using it with my Fidelity brokerage account. I could not use it to make a money transfer - not happening with all of their technical support. Their suggestion; use a REAL computer. Their built-in Hanscon ""Word"" and ""Excel"" applications work OK by themselves but because of the MS copyrights saving and recalling files is a pain because they make you jump through more file manipulation steps to get to you folders. Another major pain is basic editing features. It is almost impossible in some applications to do simple ""Copy"" and ""Paste"" types of functionality. I know that apart of the issue is that application developers are to blame - it doesn't matter who's at fault if you  can't do what you want.

The positives are that it has a great display and some of the ""phone like"" user interface features are nice. The battery life is OK and the touch display works great. The price is great too. It just isn't ready for use as a serious laptop capable computer - it falls way short. I'm taking a loss on this purchase and now I'm going to try a Lenovo Yoga 2 in 1 running Windows 10.",
"I researched for ages and it is so hard comparing negative and positive reviews! It is exhausting work, too.  I had an iPad 2 from work and wanted a tablet of my own for home.  I have the Samsung Galaxy 5 phone and felt so-so about it. It's battery does not last and it has more features than I need.  But the background knowledge helped me set up this tablet very easily!

The screen is gorgeous, email, Web surfing, games, easy, sound is WAY better than iPad and the battery lasts forever.  I love that it has a micro SD slot so I can transfer stuff to my laptop or desktop.  Pdf files are way easier on here than on the iPad too.

Super happy I bought this tablet. I just need to find a good case now.

Also, download Amazon play store to get your Kindle app and stream music from the Prime Music app if you have a membership. I played music for 4 hours today and it only went down to 80% battery power. That was impressive to me!",
"I upgraded from an old Acer Iconia Tab A500. I'm really not seeing a big difference in performance except for the screen resolution. I find the Galaxy Tab S is a little more responsive but nothing significant. The Galaxy Tab S has one BIG DOWNSIDE. Samsung has loaded it so full of bloatware that it actually made me angry with the countless updates and pestering me to sign up for this or that. Google is in your face constantly with their apps too. At one point a popup advised me that it was updating 239 apps (I have installed only 37 of my own).  At times I really want to put a bullet hole in it and ship it back to Samsung...  but watching videos is much better then on my old Acer.

BEFORE YOU BUY BE AWARE THAT SAMSUNG HAS PREINSTALLED TONS OF JUNK APPLICATIONS THAT WILL ANNOY THE SH*T OUT OF YOU. You can't uninstall most of them. You'll have to go through each and every one of them, determine if they are required for the operating system by google-ing etc.  Then you have to disable them if possible - not all can be disabled. After that you have to hide each one from the menus to get rid of all the clutter.

Too bad.... this is a really nice tablet otherwise. As it is Samsung has decided to sell you a product full of advertisements and tricks to get you to sign up for this or that.

Maybe I will shoot it...  I'll keep you posted.

2/21/17 I shot it with a 4/10 shotgun and yes, I enjoyed doing it. The tablet began to fail a few months ago. The battery would sometimes charge and other times not. For example, I would leave it plugged but when I went to use it the battery was low. I was also experiencing frequent lockups when the battery got low. Yes I checked cables etc. (internal and external). I fully regret this purchase and would not recommend this brand tablet to anyone. Google the issue regarding battery problems and you'll find a lot of unhappy owners. This item is too expensive to take the risk.",
"Wow wow wow, I just received my tablet and it is BEAUTIFUL.  I also own iPad and the Samsung's screen resolution is so much better than iPad.  I purchased this basically to play Megapolis which I play on all platforms and seeing the screens side by side lets me know that I made a great purchase.  I own Samsung TVs and their pictures are beautiful too, so I can say that they have done it again in this Tablet.  I know that I will get very little sleep tonight because I'll be exploring this wonderful Tablet.  Looks like Apple has some real competition with this one.  I do love my iPad but I can already tell I'm going to love this Tablet too and I'm not certain I want to spend any longer what Apple wants with its hardware, of course time will tell.

If you are looking for a new Tablet search no further and go for this one.  I was looking for the larger screen size because of being a game player but I have been reading that Samsung should be coming out with a new smaller screen size sometime this year, so if smaller is what you want just keep waiting.

Love it, love it.",
"This is a recent upgrade to my Galaxy Tab 2 10 inch and I'm VERY pleased with this new device. It is everything I was hoping it would be, and then some. Nice weight, stunning graphic, fast processor, stable and solid in every respect. There really isn't much to add to the other reviews because it just IS the best Android tablet available. That said, I wish they had stayed with the soft-touch buttons that stay on the bottom left of the screen however you choose to orient the tablet. The three hard buttons fixed to the bottom of the device REALLY get in the way when you hold it vertically when reading a book or playing a game that only plays when the device is vertical. I'm sure there was a reason for doing this, but I LOVE the moving soft-touch buttons of my Tab 2 and do NOT like these stationary hard-touch buttons at all. Since everything else about this tablet is wonderful, I'm only taking off 1 star for the dislike of the buttons, but I would love this tablet completely if not for this one, stand out poor decision by the people who designed the Tab S.",
"With the Samsung Galaxy Tab S 10.5, Samsung finally got their Android tablet right. Having used the previous variations of the Galaxy Tab back to the first 7 inch version, this is by far the best Android tablet out there. The tablet is light, though not quite on par with the Sony Xperia Z2 Tablet, and it is thin. The screen is gorgeous and the battery life is much improved.

I am not completely sold on a fingerprint sensor for a tablet, though. Maybe for business use, but for personal use, not quite.

Pros

Lightweight & thin
Gorgeous display
Fast, even with TouchWiz
Great battery life, roughly 9-11 hours with 8-9 hours of screen time using low brightness
Smaller bezels - finally
Dual speakers!!!

Cons

TouchWiz still isn't the best UI. I installed Nova Launcher for a better experience.
Bloatware - But this isn't a Nexus device so it was to be expected
Smaller bezels - where can I put my hands without interrupting the scrolling experience?
Physical buttons - come on, Samsung, it's 2014. On screen buttons should be the standard.
Speaker location - could be on the front. Hey, at least we got two!

Conclusion: Overall, the tablet is a vast improvement over previous Samsung offerings and near the top of the list for Must-Have Android tablets.",
"My daughter got one of these for Christmas, and I was blown away by the screen quality and snappy response. I purchased the white 16 GB model, and have been VERY pleased. Video playback is a beautiful thing, as are the games I've tried on it. I've thrown some very video intense games at it, and it hasn't lagged or stuttered once. I happen to like the S5 look, and am pleased that the tablet works so well with my phone.The tablet came with Samsung coupons for 50% off any accessory, so I purchased the bluetooth keyboard case. I'm not overly crazy about the case design - the tablet and case remain separate pieces; when closed, the tablet fits into a slot and is held in place by a spring-loaded clip. When open, the tablet rests at an angle into another slot. It is, however, an EXCELLENT keyboard and is an incredibly useful extension, making the tablet come very close to a mini-laptop.

There are some issues with some of these tablets. My daughter's tablet is unable to stream video from Netflix OR the Google Play store. She can download video that she'd rented or purchased to her SD card and play it, but steaming will not work. We found many folks who'd purchased this tablet had the same problem, as there were hundreds of comments regarding the Netflix issue. We called Netflix, and they responded that it's a hardware problem with Samsung. Same response with Google. To date, no response from Samsung. Best advice if you purchase this tablet and run into issue where you can't stream - contact Amazon immediately for an exchange or refund. I sincerely hope you don't encounter it though, because in every other respect this is an awesome device.",
"This is the second time I've replaced this tablet. I carelessly (& accidentally) dropped the first one, face down with it being in its Samsung cover, and the darn thing had a large crack across the entire screen; though it still functioned properly. For awhile, I had been using it in its cracked state, but after awhile, I couldn't take it anymore. So, I ended up purchasing this same tablet all over again. I am a previous iPad 3 owner and will never go back to Apple again. The Galaxy Tab S 10.5 is still by-far, the best tablet on the market, in my opinion. It's even better than the Tab S2. I absolutely LOVE the high resolution screen on here, being able to watch Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, control my Roku, use Microsoft Excel, Word, PowerPoint, and love that I have the option to insert a micro SD card if I want more space. The only (& first) drawback I had after only a week, was experiencing the tablet not turning on or charging. Since this had never happened before, I decided to Google the issue. Turns out, while it is a rare occurrence, you need to do the following 3 in order: Press and hold down the Power -- Volume Up--Home keys at same time for 20 seconds, after which the green Android mascot should appear. When it does, it will give you two options to choose from. Choose the option that let's you cancel out of it (Press the Volume down). Next, the screen will say it's  downloading & not to turn device off. Wait about a few seconds, then repeat the holding of Power--Volume Up--Home keys at same time for about 10-15 seconds and everything should be back to normal. Make sure you charge it immediately. Aside from that extremely  minor and rare mishap, this tablet is a must!!!",
"Well I got it this afternoon. Funny cause the mailman was just putting my mail in the box when we drove up from Miami. So I've been messing around with it all afternoon. So far I like it. The display is insane and the keys are huge. Those were my biggest concerns and they are solved. It is noticeably faster. Even Web pages seem quicker. I'm still confused about a couple of things? Mostly settings. It says you can adjust the screen to a couple different settings but I try it just stays at the setting it wants to stay at? And a touch setting that says it's for wearing leather gloves to tap the screen etc. I was hoping for a setting that would make the tapping harder! You just look at this thing and it types or whatever. Less sensitive would be good.
I'm not sure I would rate it better than the iPad just yet? It is quite a bit easier to navigate. Could be I just don't understand apple's icons very good? The screen alone is much nicer than ipad. And I can see where having two browsers open side by side will be usefull. Or maybe a map and a browser., IPad can't touch that! Much lighter than Eileen's ipad. But her's isn't the iPad air? So I'll just have to take their word on that. I thought I read that this had a mini USB port? Haven't investigated that yet but unless the charging port doubles as mini USB I can't find it?
So, all in all I would advise that someone looking at ipad take a side by side look at the Tab S. I have a feeling that if I took this into an Apple store they would ask me to leave! Hmmmmm. Sounds like fun?
Oh, I've been using the fingerprint scanner to unlock this. Seems to work fine.

So, that is my official first day reveiw. Feel free to sell it to your friends, co-workers and family! Lol",
"I've had a Nexus 7 (2013) as my tablet.  I was looking into a 10"" tablet, primarily to play games and surf the web.  I wanted a tablet with a great display and high end processing power.  After researching numerous Android tablets (Apple's high price and lack of expandable memory eliminates iPad's from my consideration), I settled on the Galaxy Tab S.  I am extremely happy with my purchase for a number of reasons.

1.  Display - You can't appreciate how vivid and vibrant this display is without seeing it in person.  In a word, it is gorgeous to the point where you want to use the tablet more and more.  From movies on Netflix to magazines on Google Newsstand, the display just continues to impress me.  I've played with an iPad Air, Air 2, and mini and none have a display as good as the Galaxy Tab S.

2.  Size - This is an extremely thin and light tablet.  Compared to the Air 2, I can't really tell a difference in size or weight.  The Galaxy Tab S does have a slightly bigger display, but not by much.  The aspect ratios differ as well; I believe the iPad has a 4:3 and the Galaxy Tab S is 16:10.

3.  Micro SD - This is a great feature that sets the Galaxy Tab S from an iPad.  I was easily able to play my music and some videos on a micro SD card.  The tablet detected it without any issues and I didn't have to spend time side loading them onto the tablet like you would have to do on iTunes.  Knowing that I can simply swap out a micro SD card with additional media will make this a great tablet to have when traveling.

Overall this is an excellent tablet.  I got my for $447 on Amazon, which is even less expensive than a $499 iPad Air 2 16gb model.  If you are looking for a top end tablet, the Galaxy Tab S is the way to go.",
"Bought mine as a FACTORY refurb 2 1/2 years ago and it has performed flawlessly since day one! I emphasize factory, because as far as I'm concerned you're taking your chances buying one refurbished by anyone else. I use it every day, for everything from running my small business to just about every type of gaming. I can count on one hand the number of times it has locked up or power cycled, and it's always been due to bad apps I've installed and not the tablet itself. Battery life is still great...with steady use it'll last all day and if i unplug it in the morning and don't happen to use it until evening, it'll usually still be over 90% charged. Anyone with experience knows that its the screens on our devices that use up the most power while we use them, and this big beasty is no exception, so keep it set to auto adjust the brightness and it saves a lot of juice!
  The one and only flaw it has is due to the boneheaded decision Samsung made when they decided to build their flagship tablet with only 16gb of storage! That combined with the ridiculous amount of bloatware Samsung cant stop themselves from burdening their every device with, means that you will have to keep a close eye on storage space.
  Samsung was nice enough to toss out an update to Android 6.0.1 some time back, which improved things a bit by allowing the disabling of unwanted factory apps, which in turn did free up some space. However, the ONE feature that all of us in the Tab S 10.5 fanclub were REALLY looking forward to with Marshmallow, that of being able to format external memory cards as INTERNAL memory, Samsung chose NOT to implement! I know, right! There IS, however, a workaround that can be found on the XDA Developers website, for those savvy enough to try it.
  So, my recommendation is, by this tablet! It's not perfect, but none are. It's got one of the best screens available, even by todays standards, plenty of power, excellent build quality, and if you can keep the app installs under control (or try the workaround I mentioned), you will have in your hands one of the best!",
"This tablet is expensive but worth it if you want the best screen you can get. The colors are vivid and the picture is very sharp. The device connects to my new samsung 46"" tv and when viewing video on both simultaneously you can really see the difference. I was doing this while viewing parts of the last Craig Ferguson show and wow- his set looked much more colorful and sharp compared  to the TV's screen. More contrast on the S too.  Also on Christmas eve I shot some aerial go pro video of my cousin's farm. Christmas morning I showed them the video on the Tab S and several commented on how great the picture was. And, I did not tell them it was a new tablet before hand. So if you are buying a tablet for videos and pictures,then the screen is well worth it.  The device also has better connectivity than other tablets too. It has software that connects to your desktop/laptop so you can exchange any kind of files between your pc/tablet/cloud service. The tab S sees other devices in my house for connectivity and this was important to me as I don't like tablets/phones that try to limit your access to the outside world.

  If you can, try to look at the product in a store before you buy so you can see for yourself.  I did not do this and bought the Tab S 8.4 at first but after seeing the 10.5 in the store I had Amazon exchange it. The 10.5 size screen is much better for me but look at both and decide for yourself.

 Also I recommend you get some kind of case right away to protect the Tab S. Here is an inexpensive one that works well and while you may want something fancier later, this will get you going:

http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00L7GVIBQ/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

Now if you want to travel with you Tab S, here is a really nice Amazon traveling bag that fits the S well. This bag is of better quality than I expected for the price and I highly recommend it:

http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DUGZFA6/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

To balance this review,  I will have to say that Samsung also makes really nice mid line tablets as well. My GF got the Tab 4 8.0 and this is a great tablet at a much cheaper price. If money is an issue, look at these tablets. The screen is not as good, but it is still VERY good (better than the professional reviews will have you believe) and worth a look if you can't spend the money on the S.

I just read on the news this morning that Sony is coming out with a slightly larger tablet than the S, but without the nice screen. The price is going to be around $1000. Ouch! Good luck Sony competing at that price , esp with a basic LCD screen. Now I don't feel so bad about the S's price after reading that :)",
"I love this tablet. It's a 5 star tablet.
- The screen is amazing. Crystal clear and probably the best out there for tablets.
- Speed. This tablet is fast and I've only had mild lag issues.
- Android. The interface is wonderful, smooth, and intuitive.

But it has one fatal flaw. Bloatware.

I am paying for a 16gb tablet, yet I can only use a fraction of this amount because of the many unnecessary apps that are pre-installed and impossible to remove. Why?

If apps come pre-installed, allow us to remove them. I don't use Evernote, yet it is pre-installed and impossible to remove. Why? What function does this serve?

Doing the math, buyers really get about a 8gb tablet. 4-5gb goes to system memory and another 2-3gb are apps you can't get rid of.

I could add a SD card, but that also has drawbacks. In my experience, SD cards are unreliable. I've lost data numerous times due to SD card failure. This is the path I took and if I find a reliable card, I will update my review here.

It is really a shame that such wonderful hardware (and some software) gets dragged down by bloatware.",
"This tablet just blows me away!  I love the super-bright display and all the ways I am going to be able to use it!  It connects to my desktop so I don't need to store all my files on the tablet!  I can see my ""scrapbooked"" recipe cards while I cook, or read the sewing instructions I've downloaded while I sit at my sewing machine.  I have music on a tiny micro SD card, photos of my family, and I can read lots of Kindle e-books that I've downloaded to it.  It's  my computer, only portable!  I can wander all over our neighborhood with it and still surf or send email via Wi-Fi.  (Tip:  I did buy a new and very powerful combo modem/router to give me extended range - a Motorola Surfboard Extreme).  The full screen-width keyboard is easy to use for any size hands.  It is extremely fast when loading anything.  The battery lasts all day, and the camera is as good as my Canon SD, so it takes great pictures! The beautiful white case looks like expensive art glass.  It will soon be my ONLY computer because I'm having reconstructive surgery on my dominant hand, but I'll be able to do everything online that I need to with this delicious device, using only my non-dominant hand.  It will keep me happy during an otherwise very frustrating several months of recovery, and then again when I have my other hand surgery.  You can even choose to set it up for right or left handed use!  It does so much more than I expected, so I am just delighted with my purchase.  Be sure to get a nice case/stand to put yours in, because these are a bit slippery.  I will not only have a leather case/stand, but I'm making a beautiful tapestry mini brief case with handles to carry it in, because for me, handles will be absolutely necessary, but not everyone will need them.  If you have other things to carry, I recommend a case with handles, though.",
"One of the most disappointing devices i have ever owned.
CONS:
! enormous amount of bloatware that is UNREMOVABLE!!  No device is worth this aggravation
2 too complicated of an interface with for example 4 different categories of settings  and some of the placement and terms make no sense.  It took so long to figure out and i still dont get it  ex.Whatz ""dreamware"" setting mean?
3If there is an sd card port i cant find it-- or exactly which data device to buy from amazon,
4 Theres so many settings for power savings  that i have absolutely no idea why it is using up power so fast...even tho i attempted  the max power saving settings.
5 Samsung communication and support is abysmal on weekends.  The agent on Live Chat from overseas had no device to see and no information about it at all.  Wasted an hour with her and then she tried to transfer me to Smart Tutor but it was way to late at 7 pm Saturday Pacific time!
6 You cannot download itunes via wifi,
7 It is very large and awkward and shuts off easily  coz of  where the buttons are placed---so  one cannot use it w/o buying a cover/holder
8 It takes a special fast charging cord but it gets lost & mixed up in a big household and hard to remember which one it is.  Why not make it red or purple to stand out?.
9  the device flipped for a while  from desktop to desktop.  I dont know why  they have three home screens except they were needed to fit on all the bloatware icons!  Nothing is explained in writing --just strange logo icons,  I use this so rarely i cant remember what each one means .or all the steps to go thru.w/o consulting google search constantly..
When Samsung customer service didnt have a clue how to fix my home screen issue or how to put on a file icon for audio i eventually had to do a total factory reset  that took hours due to my music files.  I can hardly wait till  i will be able to get a pc expert to root this device so i will be able to install and uninstall what i want ! This is so unintuitive and  so confusing that i wish sincerely i had not bought it. Its not for non techies like me(smile)

PRO:s
1 Great picture!
2Amazing high def camera that is easy to use and makes beautiful photos and nice wallpaper for the homescreen and a great Gallery!
3 There are a number of colorful covers available on amazon that make its huge size easer to handle
4  It has lasted a year with no breakdowns or issues that i needed to go to pc repair shop.for
5Good replacement for a dvd player if you dont have a small laptop and have wifi available
6 Thaere are so  many factory apps that some have to be useful-- . such as sVoice. when you figure out the commands to say
7 It seems to have a huge amount of internal data storage space for Kindle audiobooks app and never had to juggle songs or delete apps to install new ones,
_______
Conclusions This device is ""neither fish nor fowl""  You get the approximate size of a small laptop without the flexibility and clear interface .  You do get a great camera but w/o the many advantages of  a much cheaper cell phone  --plus it is crammed with permanent bloatware --so why not just put out the money upfront for a high quality l laptop with windows 7 or 10 and save the annoyance?",
"I have been using an original iPad for about 4 years, and switched to an iPad air last year.  Each of those were $500 at the time I purchased them and held up great (iPad 1 still works well).  However, my two kids have basically taken ownership of those and I didn't want to spend another $500 on something with only 16gb of space.

Enter the Samsung Galazy Tab S 10.5.  Yes, it only has 16 gb of space, however it has a micro SD card slot, so I bought a 64 gb micro SD card and drastically increased the memory.  I can now actually have all my music and hours upon hours of videos without having to constantly manage them the way I did with the 16gb iPads.  I know apple sells iPads with larger space, but I don't want to drop $700 on a tablet.  I was able to find this tablet for $400 during the holiday season.

Pros:
1 - Beautiful screen - Videos look amazing and crisp.
2 - Can freely transfer movies/music via micro SD card.  I am no longer trapped to iTunes or CopyTransManager (great iTunes alternate).
3 - Multi-tasking ability - I find it pretty easy to jump around in the KitKat software.
4 - Torrent capabilities - I've heard that some people use torrents to download media, it can be done directly on this device and you don't have to work your way from PC>copytrans/itunes>tablet.  It can all be done on one device here.

Cons:
1 - My biggest concern so far is the lack or high volume.  The volume is fine for watching at home/car, but I fly alot and I'm worried it won't be loud enough to drown out the plane nose.  There are volume booster apps that help (22% increase IIRC). My favorite iTunes feature was that you could go to the movie properties and increase the volume 100%, that was a huge help on flights.

I really can't oversell the advantage Samusung has with the micro SD card option over the iPad, it makes everything so convenient, at least for my purposes of movies, music, and photos.",
"Every new Samsung tablet (and there have been already 13 different tablets released by Samsung just this year alone) is inevitably compared with the Apple iPad. The Tab S is so far a crowning achievement for Samsung and it is pinning it's fortune on the new Amoled display, which is simply put, gorgeous to look at. Amoled technology (unlike more conventional LCD which powers iPad and every other tablet on the market) does not rely on background lighting to assist display. Instead, each pixel (and there are more then 4 million on this tablet alone) can be individually lighted on demand. This translates to black colors that are true black and whites that are true whites. Resulting contrast is more then 1,000 times better then any leading LCD display on the market. This display is also more battery friendly and thinner then LCD which results in the record setting thinness of the entire tablet (only 6.6mm or .26""). Samsung Tab S display can go very bright in full sunlight to very dark in dark rooms at night. It is also easier on the eyes in the dark situation due to larger resolution and better contrast. You can read it in your bed at night without as much eye strain as other tablets. This display is revolutionary in the tablet market and Samsung should get all the credit for introducing it without additional price tag. So what about the rest of the tablet hardware?

- CPU: Samsung uses 2 quad core CPUs that are slightly beating Apple in-house CPU in benchmarks.

- RAM: 3GB of memory, compared to 1GB in Apple results in much better multitasking. iPad can perform marvelously when you are running just one App, but if you have many apps open and switch between them often, it simply can not keep up.

- Wi-Fi: Dual-band AC Wi-Fi chip that Samsung is using supports the latest generation of routers and results in faster internet speeds and further distance it can go from the router, compared to iPad. I have a large property around my house and have no problems connecting to internet from 100 yards away with still respectable speeds. Of course your results would vary depending on the number of walls between router and the tablet and your router specs.

- Battery: Samsung Tab S lasts me around 10 hours of general use (only light gaming, mostly browsing or streaming videos). Apple iPad in comparable scenario lasts around 12 hours. Kudos to Apple in-house CPU which is extremely power conscious and overall iOS more conservatively tuned compared to Android. Both tablets have very long life though.

- Weight: Samsung Tab S 10.5"" is much larger tablet vs latest iPAD Air yet it is lighter (even if by a hair). I use it without any cover and can comfortably grip with one hand for a long time.

- Sound: Tab S has two side facing speakers (in landscape mode which is natural for watching videos) with stereo sound. There are complains that they feel under-powered and lack bass. These complaints are justified. While speakers can go pretty loud when source provides aggressive soundtrack, a lot of movies go for a subtler approach and this tablet can not compensate. So games, music and TV shows are usually loud enough with good stereo separation, but many movies feel a bit quiet even at maximum sound. I caught myself many times trying to adjust sound when watching movies specifically.

- Other secondary specs are all in favor of Samsung. GPS, SD card slot that supports up to 127GB of extra on-board storage, fingerprint sensor for user login and support for multiple users (so you can safely share your tablet with your family), multi-window to run up to two different apps at the same time (for example watching movie and running browser on the side to read about actors/plot). Apple iPad has none of these features.

So why, you would ask I still rate latest Tab S at 4 stars instead of 5? It is all due to software and App ecosystem that truly differentiates Samsung tablets from Apple iPads. iOS is simpler to use compared to Android with Samsung TouchWiz interface on top of it. If you prefer to use your tablet as is and don't like learning and exploring all the features that it can provide, Apple gives you what you want. Android has been leapfrogging iOS in features and functionality for the past couple of years, yet Apple is not fighting this battle. It gives you one option where Android would usually provide 4 or 5, but this single option is better implemented then most of the Android alternatives. Samsung own interface (TouchWiz) and App marketplace tries to bridge that gap and fails miserably. Samsung just can't write good software. They throw more and more bells and whistles at you hoping that at least something would stick. Alas, even techies would turn most of these off after a day or two of playing. For the rest of the consumer mass it only adds confusion and additional learning curve. I would list just few of these features here: face tracking, side syncing, low power mode, hand gestures, etc. They all are only marginally helpful and mostly gimmicks.

Finally there is App ecosystem. If I can argue that Google marketplace has long caught app in Apps for smartphones, this is still not true for tablets where Apple marketplace still provides more and better refined options then Android. Most of the popular apps and games are present on both platforms. But developers prioritize iOS to Android due to better return on investment and wider, more affluent tablet audience with iPads compared to myriad of Android tablets. This results in many apps coming to iOS first and then ported to Android. And existing apps usually have better interface on iPad.

So here you have it. Great tablet, best display on the market bar none, cutting edge hardware and very good software that is better suited to non-conservative consumers that are willing to play with all that the tablet can provide vs only wanting to use it as is.
I would also add that you need to take a closer look at 8.4"" version of the same Samsung tablet. It is lighter, better fitting to one hand using and provides same hi-res Amoled display and identical hardware. If you spend more time reading compared to video watching, it is a better alternative. It is also $100 cheaper, which puts it in more budget-friendly territory.",

"I bought this tab through Amazon a few weeks ago, so far I am loving it. The look and feel as well as functions exceeded my expectations.

1. Design and appearance: as many review sites already mentioned, it has much better screen (AMOLED HD) than iPad Air, the resolution is about 20% higher. I was very impressed with how good video and pictures look on it. The screen is slightly larger than iPad, but the tab weights less (-0.4 oz off an already light weight). Overall design is slick and well-build - might be too shinny & slick though, it's hard to hold onto it.

2. Interface: initial set up is easy. the tab runs on a full Android system (v4.4), operation is smooth. I have been juggling different programs at the same time, there is no lagging. I tested the tab with Google Play Music, Spotify, Milk Music, HBO Go, You Tube, Netflix, etc. You can also use the ""Watch On"" app to control your TV and Set Top box (I tested with Att Uverse with great success). It has got 3GB RAM vs. iPad's 1GB, and 8MP rear camera vs. iPad's 5MP.

3. Connectivity: I happen to have a Samsung Smart Blu-ray player, which allows me to ""screen mirror"" the tab to TV through the BD player. The experience is tons better when you surfing the web, Facebook, YouTube, or other social sites than using the incumbent apps on your smart TV or BD player. The screen mirror does leave black bars on both sides of your TV screen, due to the mis-match of resolution between the tab and your TV. If you are not completely satisfied with this, you can try ""pair"" your tab with either your Samsung TV or BD player - this works only with some apps (I tested YouTube with success). Alternatively, you can try Google Chromecast to cast everything through HDMI port. The tab also connects well with my Android phone through ""sidesync"".

4. Expansion: one reason I choose this tab over iPad is that it comes with MicroSD slot. I bought a high speed SanDisk msd with 64G capacity for this tab, which is working well. For years Apple has been ignoring customer request for MicroSD ... they force the customer to choose different hard drive capacity, so they can charge more $$. I like very much Samsung leave the choice and flexibility to its customers.

5. Price: the tab is about :$80 to $120 cheaper than iPad Air (considering the memory expansion). I don't see how iPad can compete since the tab offer all functions and more than iPad.

6. Battery: not bad, but I hope it lasts longer and charge faster, one area for improvement.

Overall very satisfied.

---------------------------------
March 2016 Update

Everything still works well, however, I did find a major issue: with recent update of Android system, the feature of moving apps from internal memory to MicroSD card has been disabled for most apps. This means you will be running out of the 16G memory pretty fast, and makes the MicroSD expansion completely useless. However, based on my research, it is more a restriction implemented by app designers and Google Android, so it is a bit unfair to blame Samsung. Nevertheless, be aware of this issue if you plan to buy this tab.",
"I did a research for 2 months about tablets since I don't like to buy things by impulse... Since is a medium/large investment I wanted to be sure that this is what I need it... Currently I have a Samsung Galaxy S4 as a phone and a Macbook as a laptop.. Previously I had an Iphone 4s and an Ipad Retina Display which undoubtedly you can guess I was an apple user... But when I bought the Galaxy S4 I did it because I needed a flexible device with more space and I can't afford paying extra $100 for 16gb more on i-devices when you have android devices with memory card Slots which you can purchase 64gb for $30... Same happened with the tablet... I wanted a device that can replace what I normally do on the computer:
- facebook
- youtube
- email
- browsing
- downloading torrent
- watching movies (all formats mkv, avi, mp4, etc)
- watching or editing word docs
- listen to music
- playing casual games...

On the Galaxy Tab S I'm doing all that with plenty space or power to do more things... let me give you my review of the main point of this tablet:

Display: nothing more to add that hasn't been said... simply the best display on a tablet.... its look much better than my Ipad retina display (which I gift it to my GF), color on ipad look pale and wash out... people complaint that color on super amoled look over saturated... and even if they do... I don't get how people complaint about it when it just look better than any other devices..

Design: This is something that I don't care that much... since I'm not looking all the time at the back of the device... I'm looking at the screen... but feel like a premium device... is super thin... and lightweight.. Yep.. the Ipad look more premium with the metal cases.. but the Galaxy tab S doesn't feel cheap like other samsung tablets like the galaxy tab 3...

Power: The octa core processor work great.. I'm giving this device a very heavy use so far and I haven't felt any major hiccup or lag... yes sometimes It doesn't response right away like when you exit out of an app and want to open other app right away... but is just normal like any other premium android device... unfortunately this is how the OS works... don't get me wrong... is really fast and these so called hiccups or lag are barely noticeable and even if you noticed, its for about 2 secs then the tablet response is normally... It happened sometimes on my retina display Ipad as well... I guess this is normal for any device with... well.. ram... even computers have the same problem for over years...

Interface / OS: This has been the main problem with androids.. the ecosystem is not a fancy and good looking as the IOS and samsung touchwiz is not well optimized and look dull... I have to say that by far this is the best touchwiz experience that I had.. I still prefer how IOS look and feel over android, but this is a major improvement comparing it with my Jelly Bean Galaxy S4... kitkat touchwiz is on the right direction... but they are not quite there yet... the black and blue tones are something borring and the menu, settings, contacts, profile, etc.. haven't change since... well.. ever.... just minor touches but still look the same... I'm hoping for a major overhaul with android L... I hope that they change the interface on touchwiz... that since galaxy S1 is very similar to latest version... The magazine interface is good, but is laking of widget and customization.. I'm hoping on future versions that they allow us to select free feeds to add to the widgets since they only have a couple ""categories"" that I don't care that much like culture, bussiness, living, photos, travel.. etc... I don't see gaming or movies like on flipboard... and they only have twitter as a feed, I don't see facebook or instagram...

Apps: IOS has more tablet dedicated apps, but is not noticeable for my usage, email, youtube and browser are tablet friendly and that is what I use the most... facebook and all other work fine... even if they are phone versions... look and feel better than on my galaxy S4... android had the same problem with apps vs the app store a few years back and they catch up... they will do the same shortly with tablets.... Some apps doesn't work on my country like paper garden, milk music and most of the ""gift apps"" that come with the table... but is not a big deal for me...

Camera: haven't use it... I don't care about it..

FingerPrint scanner: This is a feature that I don't care that much but it Work 95% of the time... is a good ratio if you asked me... I heard some bad reviews that It never works... but is working fine for me...

Multi-Users: this is great... you can have 2 users on the same tablet like on computers... I'm not sure if there is a feature like this on IOS but is perfect for me, since I can have 2 accounts... one for me and one for my GF....

Multi tasking/ multi windows: Work perfect... this is another thing that IOS is missing... I was considering buying an Ipad Air over this... but even on IOS 8 there is no multi tasking... I use this a lot since I translate some documents... I had the translator app on top and the word app at the bottom and do my work directly from my galaxy tab S without even open my computer...

Battery: I head so many great things... but I had to say that battery is average.... I will say same or even a little less than the Ipad... don't get me wrong.. it last the whole day with normal usage... but it drain out the battery fast when I use my torrent app... or when I download anything...

Usage: perfect laptop replacement... I download some movies on it.. and watch them on any format... I have some movies and videos on my computer and I don't have to use the stupid itunes and a program to convert my avi movies to mp4 in order to transfer the movies to the tablet... I just simply copy them to my SD card.. and that's it... since I have Tab S I haven't use my computer only to do this review since involve a lot of typing... I'm just waiting for that keyboard case for this tablet and I'll be done.

Bottom line, is an excellent device if you plan to replace your laptop or use it less since is more confortable to do it from a tablet... I'm using my phone even less... since I prefer to browse facebook and twitter on the tablet than on the phone... the screen is amazing... better than any laptop/tablet I've ever seen... and the multi tasking and sd card slot are the catch that put me away from other IOS device... more tablet dedicated apps are coming daily on the play store... so is not a deal breaker over the ipad... and the ecosystem is getting in the right direction.. even touchwiz is looking better these days than previous versions....",
Screen quality superb!!!,
Good performance,
Exelente buen producto,
"PROS:
- fast
- upgradable (RAM and SSD), bracket and screws not included for 2nd SSD
- w/ fingerprint sensor
- acceptable camera quality
- loud and clear enough speaker

CONS:
- low quality screen, not good for content editing, needs some calibration to make it look good",
"Excelente equipo, luego de un mes de uso no me ha causado ningun tipo de problema. Cumple con lo que promete.

Ademas, excelente bateria

Actualizare si pasa algo despues.

Por ahora, recomendado!",
"I purchased this less than a year ago. It would shut off on its own until the motherboard finally fried itself. Dell replaced the motherboard and keyboard because they both got fried, it never got over 70 degrees Celsius so this should not have happened. Dell supposedly fixed it and since I've had it back for 2 days it has shut down 5 times on it's own and wouldn't even finish a diagnostic test, after 3 attempts. After it shuts down the power button is disabled. Beware, this thing sucks. Buy a Thinkpad, Dell makes some garbage. Never again with Dell",
"Pros
- RAM can be upgraded
- Just fast, great CPU and fast storage
- WIFI6 (Intel AX200)
- 2nd SSD slot (need to purchase bracket, Not incluided with the machine)
- Good battery life (6-9 hours)
- Figerprint sensor
Cons
- Screen its ok, but not has good has an IPS screen
- Keyboard its not bad, but backlit its not great (clear letter with gray keyboard), only useful in a dark room.",
"Is fast, screen is great. Sound is awesome. Battery has proven to last up to 6 hours.

Cons:
- Screen brightness and resolution are good but could work better under natural light.
- Touch? What touch? Don't go there.
- White lights on silver keyboard. Seriously, why?
- Mousepad sensibility needs improvement.

Overall I'm using this daily and it never fails to deliver. Is so light, charges fast, battery life is good and I have fun with it. You can use it for gaming (playing Halo in almost max settings). Worth the price.",
Garbage performance,
Great laptop for our daughter to use for online school.,
"Got this for my 2nd grader for distance learning and over 2 months in and it’s been great. Easy to use, great battery life, and perfect size.",
"Stays charged for about 3-5 hours. I mostly use it for game play, so it's best to keep it plugged and charged, if that's your intention. It also randomly power downs for no reason, which is annoying. But overall it's not bad. It's small and does what it needs to.",
"It's very light weight for easy,  discreet portability.  The battery life is much longer than the HP's I've had in the past.  And the processing speed is quite decent.  Overall, a very goodvalue for the money.",
Came in nicely with a bag and laptop was secured under tape in its own cardboard box. It’s used obviously but tested everything works perfectly fine. Will update later on after a couple month of use.,
Product was very dirty smelled weird and also did not receive the power charger,
Perfect condition and runs like new. Very useful computer for handyman services.,
"If you get really close you can see its not brand new, but it runs like it and its a third of the price",
"Laptop had plugs that did not work and I did not recieve case as advertised.

Did not like laptop",
Great refurbished computer. runs great!,
"I was so pleased that this was easy to operate out of the box.  There was a sticker for Windows 7, which had me worried, but Windows 10 was installed--as ordered.  No problems getting up and runnning.  Delivery was on time and the laptop was well packaged.",
"Fine product in good condition.  Howerver, a 960GB drive is not a 1TB drive.  Important if you need to clone a partition over.  -2 stars for incorrect description",
"I was on the fence for several months comparing specs and models until I pulled the trigger on this one. It has preformed flawlessly for what I need it for. Comes with copious amounts of storage space, good size RAM and a decent processor.

However heavy gamers need not apply, from what I'm told it can run certain games. This is fine for me as this is primarily for classes and some web browsing.

Not sure if this is the case for all machines however mine does not have a webcam. Though for me I prefer a computer without one.",
"Looks brand new new, packed nice. Just plugged it in and started it.  Once you set up your Microsoft account, your ready to go. Coming from Win 7 to 11 is quite different but it's great.",
"Liked the size and performance until it stopped working.  Screen goes blank. Shows it’s trying to repair itself. On occasion it will fully reboot and you can start use again.  However, it won’t last long.  Will never by a refurbished item again!",
It is all it stated. liking it,
European keyboard and Chromebook is not correctly installed,
"The laptop that we bought our son for Christmas stopped working 87 days after he got to use it. Just doesn’t turn on now. We made sure it was well cared for. Seller just says tough luck. We bought 2 of these from this seller, just waiting for our daughter’s to fail too which feels very likely now.",
Great product. Run fort nite smoothly,
Excelente computadora vale la pena,
DO NOT BUY ACER. I have to believe these positive reviews and close to 5 star rating is false advertising on Amazons part. I bought an acer computer based on amazon reviews and have had nothing but trouble. It gets caught in endless up date loops. (As in hours every time you turn on the computer). I removed all software and apps to try and help remediate. I even tried to use with only internet access on the computer. Again still gets caught in endless update. I will be buying a new computer (not acer) and will NEVER trust amazon Rating system again.,
Buena,
"I like the screen size and the keyboard. The sound is trash, at full blast, it sound like whispers.",
I need my money back. This laptop never works fully. It was sent out to reboot and continues to have rebooting issues even after it was sent out.,
Satisfactory.,
Shipped as scheduled. Satisfied with cost-effectiveness.,
Works well so far. Ive had it About a month.,
"A piece  of crap. Worst computer I've ever owned. Wifi goes in and out constantly, touchscreen does not work, it doesnt charge properly and now a hinge is broken -all apparently common problems with this computer. I ordered it less than 6 months ago-didn't even begin to use it until weeks later. Amazon doesn't want to do anything  about it. Spoke to acer and they admit that all of the problems are with the computer but I need to ship it to Texas for repair-who knows when I'll be able to get it back.  I am disabled and need a computer now.  I really just want my money back- I'll ship it to them for that. I don't want it period -repaired or not.",
It is just like my older ACER Love the speed of the computer,
I wanted a computer that was fast and responsive. I got it.,
"It was easy to set up.. Great speed, HD pictures are great.",
"Hasta el momento el equipo ha trabajado perfectamente, llego completo en su caja, todo bien cuidado. Me parece que fue una buena compra, espero que sea duradera. Me pareció bastante rápida, y tiene para muchas funciones. Su teclado iluminado ayuda en la oscuridad.",
Not user friendly,
I love this computer. I bought it a few weeks ago because my old computer ran really slow. I play Sims 4 and have most of the expansions. My old computer would take at least 30 minutes to get ready to load into the game. This computer takes less than a minute. Anyone who has tried playing Sims 4 with that many expansions knows how amazing that is. I definitely recommend.,
I bought this for my son who is going into College and so far the ease of the laptop is great and it's had no issues.  Internet speed is fast and it's crispy clear.,
Computer arrived with a foreign plug.  No Windows 11 pro.  Don’t whats up with it.,
"This was a nightmare purchase.
Firstly, This is not a model built for the USA market.
Ships with. European keyboard.(Different layout)
The recovery image on the internal drive is not Windows 11
It is Ubuntu.
If you have to do a complete reinstall as I did, You are screwed!
Dell tech support informed me that this unit was not even licensed for Windows 11",
"Much faster than a windows computer, I should’ve bought one of these years ago!",
"This product  came with no dvd drive, or storage drive with windows 10 as listed. just tower itself.",
"I can't convey my feelings well... so, here:

 I was so excited, to get hold of this thing, I literally went ""squee!!"".

For you children of  the 80's: they smashed a whole Win10 desktop into a freaking Speak/Spell shell (they don't like brand names on this thing, I found), and let it have its own cell service. Wifi is mad fast
..... and the stylus works!!!!! Not just ""use your finger"" for signing, but almost a graphics tab interface. So....a computer and an etch-y sketch had a baby with a

 It's AWESOME.

The seller(s) are stand behind their items, and will probably do anything short of voodoo, to help you; should you need it.

I could go on, but you get the idea.",
"When I got it, it didn’t turn on. I was so sad. I had to send it back",
Good laptop for price.,
Arrived in good condition and is performing as expected.,
"At $800 I don't think I would be so enthused, but at $175 it is a great deal.",
I've just encountered a battery issue within two months of buying this laptop. The battery reaches the 60% mark and then drains directly to zero. Quite frustrating and unexpected for Lenovo.,
Great design and weight...,
We use this for business and barter last long and lightweight,
Poor customer service (may be covid19)  Terrible mouse position.  Battery defective.  Back up power cord stopped working after one week.  Had insurance and having trouble with Asurion.,
"I needed a new laptop for school.  After doing some research and talking to classmates, I selected the Lenovo ThinkPad.  I then compared models on the Lenovo website and the 20QD0007US met my needs.  I needed a fast CPU, 16GB of memory and a 500GB SSD.  This model met my needs.  After we got it, the customization of Windows was easy.  I also found it easy to get my Office package installed.  The final change was to reduce the size of the Windows partition and install Linux along with it.  All pretty straight forward.  So far things are great.
My only ""issue"" was with the delivery.  It was shipped via UPS with a signature required.  That sounds logical.  However, for whatever reason, the UPS driver decided to skip my house and just mark the delivery as ""no one home"".  Well, I was home all day and no UPS driver.  I had to drive to a UPS Store the next day to pick it up.",
"Brix works great installed on back of 32"" TV takes up no desktop space.  Fast PC",
Overall a good little computer.,
Great,
"This seemed like a good deal until the machine failed to recognize the AC adapter 3 days after receiving.  Also, very slow for just browsing and light work.",
My daughter loves it. She draws with it on a tablet and says it works great for that. It’s sleek turns to a tablet and nice touch screen. It’s a great laptop.,
I like the laptop and it’s easy to carry around,
Laptop continuously disconnected from internet(Spectrum).I gave it to my friend who has a different internet provider and she doesn't have the same problem with it.my dell inspiring and Google Chrome laptops have no connection issues here so I don't know why this one had the problem.,
"What Dell does with their Alienware line should be illegal.

Charging almost double for a PC you could build yourself using better parts.

This PC specifically uses older parts and a trashy custom dell motherboard all stuffed into a cramped case with poor ventilation and they have the audacity to sell it for $1400. On sale from $2200.

This is ridiculous.",
nice computer! i'm using it to write a review,
Fast and has nice features,
"I bought 2 computers one for my brother and one for me,, I was really scared that it would not be worth it , but it is we are both college students and we have never had a problem with it, also my brother plays video games in it and he doesn’t complain about the quality which it’s a good sign. Definitely buy it for your son or daughter if they need a school laptop.",
Very happy with this laptop.  Much lighter than my previous laptop. So easier to carry and move around.  It is fast. Does not have bloatware. Plenty of storage.  Love the backlit keyboard.  It has 1 TB of memory and 16 GB DDR RAM.  Acer is the go to name for laptops.  Buy it.,
"It cant activate windows 10 because the license is not valid ,other than that good computer",
"Sound is horrible,  it's quirky, and it's broke in the back, plus virtually no software.",
"Constantly freezes, black screen in the middle of anything important I am doing. Should have returned it immediately",
"I recent purchased this Acer and it will not work without being plugged in, what can I do?  I have had it only a few months and did not notice it was defective until after the return date expired.  Please help me.  Dan Douthit",
"This laptop shipped with Windows 10. It booted and immediately and immediately giving me problems with blue screens. Upon bringing it to a Tech after one hour we decided to wipe it and install Windows 11. So far so good. No blue screens. So I'm suspicious that the Windows 10 that shipped with the laptop was out of date, old drivers or corrupted from the factory? Very disappointing start with a new laptop from Acer. Hopefully starting over with Windows 11 will solve the problem permanently.",
Not the best camera.,
"No me gustó el teclado con el enter más pequeño. Tiene una tecla menos que modelos anteriores (no hay cómo escribir símbolos de mayor y menor, hay que recurrir a códigos ASCII.). Pero tiene muchas virtudes y la relación precio calidad es muy buena. Bateria de buena duración, cerca de 6 horas. Pantalla con buena visibilidad desde ángulos importantes.",
"Laptop came with correct hardware. This was a sealed box shipped from an Acer address. I was worried about some of the recent negative reviews. After receiving and starting up the unit, everything is working fine. Doing syncs and transfers now. Came with all listed specs. 2021 model. 4 star because this simply isn’t a 5 star laptop. I didn’t want to pay $1000+ for one of those though. If you’re looking for a good value and a decent computer with plenty of storage, look no further.",
Every day use.,
"I'm totally pleased with this laptop. It wasn't packed with bloatware. Setup was quick and easy. Performance is great. At this price level one learns to not expect too much, but this laptop is surprisingly fast and the monitor is crisp and the color nicely balanced. I'd recommend this laptop to anyone.",
"Two years from the date of purchase, this laptop made a grinding noise and the blue screen of death appeared. Had it looked at by an expert and it's toast.  Light use for two years and it's worthless now means I'm not buying an Acer product again.",
"Now why you ask is this a ""great buy""? Simply put space, space and more space. You see when I was shopping for a computer at first the main thing, I was looking for was a glossy screen (this computer doesn't have one) and I really wanted that until I saw 1TB SSD then that Glossy want went right out the window. I wanted something nice with space 953GB (I think) that I could afford at the time without breaking the bank and I found it in this. PS. And the screen still shows a great picture without the GLOSS....HA!",
"So I bought this because I was looking for a reasonably priced computer with a big hard drive but wanted a solid state drive instead of the old type. This has 1TB of space which is a good start for me ?? It’s light weight but has a metal shell, so I don’t have to worry as much about another screen cracking mysteriously (I had 2 laptops that became unusable because the screens mysteriously broke on both of them within a 2 month period). The computer is super fast and even though it says it’s only 1080p I swear it looks as good as my 4K TV.

Now for the cons:
The track pad is positioned on this to where I am constantly clicking it and getting the right click pop up menu, which is annoying but I’m sure if I make adjustments it will be fine. It doesn’t have a DVR for reasons unknown but it seems that a lot of newer computers don’t come with one which can be annoying at times since I have a million and one DVRs laying around, everything  from movies to custom music “mixtapes” I’ve made through the years but it’s not a deal breaker or anything. For the price with the 1 TB SSD and the other things I was specifically looking for, it was a pretty good deal. The days of $300 laptops with everything you could want are over as precious minerals needed to make them become more scarce. Hopefully this will last me at least as long as my last one did which was around 8 years until my screen broke ??",
Great laptop. This replaced one I bought in 2009. Will always buy Acer. Performance and longevity are the best. Highly recommend.,
Pleased with the tablet but disappointed it didn't come with the sim cards.,
"I don't see what the big deal is with ThinkPads, just a bit expensive for what you get, IMO. Everything seems to be okay. I purchased this for a customer of mine who really wanted a ThinkPad.

My only concern is the Kioxia brand SSD it has. Apparently Kioxia is an offshoot of Toshiba. Toshiba products, IMO, are junk low cost brands that don't last long. I've had numerous hard drives of theirs die throughout the years, and recently got a dead M.2 SSD of theirs too.

For how much you pay for this laptop, they could have at leave included a Samsung Pro SSD or something a little more mid to upper class. So far it runs Windows 11 very well.",
"Perfect, just what I was needing",
La compre ase 3 meses y solo la inicie 3 veces . Ya no prende . No la recomiendo para nada.  Es mejor ir a la tienda a comprarla. Y gastar en algo bueno. No la recomiendo,
"I bought it for college. It is not touchscreen, looks way older than a 2022 one. I left it to charge all night and day yet when I came back from work it was still at 1% battery. After the second time turning it on it never again connected to my house wifi.",
"We purchased this computer for my 9yo birthday. I didn’t want to get a chrome book because I preferred the option of him being able to work offline doing word processing and voice recording. Unfortunately we could not even figure out how to require a password for him to access the internet. However, I finally figured out how to set up kids mode for web browsing and got all his favorite websites easily accessible and more easily control the content he can see online. Unfortunately he couldn’t even watch simple videos without the computer freezing or spontaneously shutting down. It is PAINFULLY slow. Not the internet but the computer itself. Simply opening up a file takes forever. This is not worth the Money at all. Thankfully we are within the return window so we can hopefully find a better option.",
The Lenovo Ideapad 3 15.7 inch laptop with 24 GB Ram and a 1 TB HD - WITH GREAT KEYBOARD BACKLIGHTING and BATTERY life and an AMD RYZEN 5000 series CPU is a GREAT DEAL.  I am very happy.  TY Amazon and Lenovo!,
Speed over my old laptop is remarkable,
"I bought this laptop for work and use it every day.
Battery length is good but just like any device - power cord is close by and plugged in by 1/4 battery length.
the screen is amazing and youtube is great on this device.
Love it.",
waste of money,
My laptop randomly stopped working.,
Very satisfied,
Perfect! Size clarity!,
I like the big screen.,
Specs seemed good and it worked really well when I first received it.  Then it started randomly rebooting and wouldn't process the automatic repair.  Had to send it in to Asus for warranty repair.  Got it back and it didn't work a day before it started the exact same thing.  It has now been in the repair center for longer than we've been able to use it.,
"Just got it set up, so far great . For now using it for e-mail, facebook, checking ads to shop.",
This computer had been great for us so far. It's a good price for the the space you get on it.,
"This thing boots fast, enough storage for everything . I’ll be picking up a second one probably in a month or two for my partner",
We bought this computer for my wife she seems to like it. It has all that she needs to do what she wanted to do.,
"It's a great laptop, just didn't know that the keys don't light up,disappointed with that.",
"Was very slow, when I checked the drivers, were from 2006, yet this was sold as a brand new laptop.",
"The computer works great; however, it does not have a fingerprint reader on it as stated in the description.",
"Nice laptop, love the big screen and full size keyboard. Screen is bright and colors are very vivid. I  have been using it to edit videos and it has performed without flaw.",
"This is my third ASUS laptop, the first two I've had for 4 years and they have been great.  This one has a really nice screen quality and size, boots quickly, easy setup, nice processor -- seemed pretty fast until it started randomly rebooting repeatedly for no apparent reason. Difficult getting it to stop glitching/freezing up/rebooting, not due to anything I installed because I had hardly gotten started on the thing (and I used to work in IT so I have some troubleshooting skills/knowledge.) Shouldn't have to deal with this many issues right out of the box. Returned it and chose something else.",
Well this is the second Asus laptop outboard it's better but I still find that it freezes at time and it should not be doing that and it's only 3 weeks old I want to return it but that means I have to take all my programs off and redo it all over again That's the part that I hate having to take the time to reprogram these things,
"I bought this computer that my middle and high school needs recommended. I've ways purchased either Dell or  HE'S in the past thinking they were superior...I have been wrong! This computer is by far the best I have ever purchased. I don't game, just school work, but it has enough memory to game if needed. Very well manufactured laptop. Much, much better than either of the aforementioned products.",
Very good computer. Definitely a good upgrade from my previous laptop. Perfect for basic home/school/business use.,
"I was pleasantly surprised by how much I am loving my new Asus! I read a few mixed reviews but I don’t get the negativity. I think the screen quality is much better than they claimed when watching videos or movies. While most of my computer time consists of using Microsoft Office programs, I have put it through the paces. I’d also like to add what a relief it was using Amazon. I had tried purchasing a computer through NewEgg because some of my more tech-obsessed friends insisted I should. What a nightmare!!! Next time I will trust my gut and stick with Amazon! They’ve never let me down!!!",
Slow motion. Picture is not good enough.,
"I've been loyal to Asus- I don't know why but I have. I bought a nice ROG laptop in 2014, a Zenbook in 2019, and this VivoBook in 2021. I didn't even game on the ROG, just browser tabs, excel, spotify, etc. running and the thing has just always been slow and  nonresponsive. None of these computers perform, and I'm just doing simple tasks on them. I built my own PC back in college in like 2006 that booted up faster than these things, and there is an issue with the CPU being maxed out often at odd times. I'm an old techy so I've gone through all the updates, settings, etc. and I'm just not happy at all- I can't believe these products are performing this poorly in 2022. I'm going back to a desktop.",
Love the speed and large screen.  For gaming its great.,
"The laptop included the upgrade to 20GB Ram and 512GB + 1TB ssd's. The computer is new so it's fast. The keyboard layout was easy to adapt to. There is bloatware but it hasn't gotten in my way yet and with the system resources the thing has it may be a while until I notice it.

The two downsides that I have seen at this point is the battery life. I run it on the high performance setting because, well, that's what I bought it for. It gets about 3.5 hours of battery before a warning with a fast shutdown.

The most surprising issue with this laptop is the identification of the keys. They aren't lighted and the color used for the letters and symbols is indistinguishable from the key in all but the most limited lighting situations. If you know your way around a keyboard without having to look for keys this isn't such a big deal but it is annoying.

Battery life however is short at about 3.5 hours if not using the lower performance settings.
I like the laptop but the keys are all but invisible.",
"It is exactly what I needed.  The larger screen makes it much easier to use a split-screen view when working in multiple documents/spreadsheets. I stream video through my laptop as well, and the graphics and sound are excellent. The laptop even has better connection speeds with my home wifi (why that would be, I do not know, but it's true).

*I am reviewing this item for a 90-day warranty extension from Asus*",
"First... 17.3 Screen with IPS... Great color, clarity and size... I changed the resolution to 1600x900, works better for my eyes. With two cores and 4 threads I was not expecting much... but It's faster than my Intel I3 Desktop with 4 cores and 4 threads. A nice surprise... I'm thinking the 12GB of ram, 256 SSD (1-TB HDD) with the Ryzen 3 3250U chip made the difference. Photoshop Elements works like a charm and web-pages just snap into place. I don't do games, so can't speak to that. And last, this is my first ASUS computer, I'm impressed with the quality, fit and finish and the price was right. Happy with purchase.

Update 4.14.21... Business and home users should be happy... Everything about the computer is good, and the screen is great. A good everyday computer, that gets the job done. / I found some keyboard stickers on Amazon for $5. Makes the keyboard easy to see.",
I originally got this this product for a college student that lost his parents the year before starting College and was facing financial hardship trying to take care of his little brother and go to college at the same time I'm happy to say since buying this item the individual graduated college top of his class and has since passed the laptop onto his little brother to help with his school work so that one day he may go to college and hopefully maybe use this computer so that he may graduate college as well I just wanted to say thank you to Amazon and all the sellers for not only offering affordable and high quality products but making dreams is such as owning a business graduating college or even having a birthday party come true I also want to thank Amazon in the sellers for making it possible for me to help others with life's hardships such as facing eviction Financial hardships disabilities and medical issues I have many more products I've yet to write a review on which I hope to get around to soon but nonetheless they have all improved somebody's life and from the bottom of my heart I think Amazon and all of the sellers that perform their duties to the best of their capabilities provide customers with positive and polite encounters and offers so many products at a reasonable and affordable price as well as items that last and give you past time to make more smiles and to make more dreams come true,
"NOTE: This review concerns the product I received and not the entire laptop model itself.

I think I received a lemon. The laptop came in but the second we turned it on, it began overheating like crazy. It was so hot that I had to place something over my lap because I couldn't bear the heat. Later, when I plugged in the charger, the laptop screen tinted yellow. We immediately went to the Microsoft store and got a replacement.

Our replacement is really nice. Despite the mishap, I'm really happy about this laptop. It's super light, incredibly fast, and really stylish.",
I have had this laptop only a few days. I bought this mostly for work as I use Microsoft office quite often.  I absolutely LOVE it. My old one was an Asus Chromebook. I'll never go back!,
"It's a truly awesome laptop both in design and in performance. I love using it. Highly recommend this over its closest rival XPS 13. If only the screen could flip over so that Surface Pen could be used to full potential, the usability would have magnified. Nonetheless, I recommend it to everyone who want quality and performance.",
"Have had this for 7 months and have already had to replace the charger (just stopped working gradually after about 5 months), and the screen often blinks for no reason. To add insult to injury re: battery issues, the battery life is way shorter than advertised even when very few programs are running. I've always had Macbooks and thought this would be an equivalent/possible improvement - and really wanted to like it - but between Windows 10 being meh and these hardware issues I'll be switching back.

The alcantara keyboard also darkens over time where your hands sit.",
"I use this product to do school work mostly and it has been perfect for my use thus far. It is fast, stores data well, I can easily switch between applications and touch screen makes it easy to do readings.",
"So far, I’m loving just about everything. The screen has a beautiful clarity and a perfect size. It’s slim, yet sturdy and everything works smoothly. My only issue is facial recognition doesn’t consistently work, so I just use a good old fashion password. It runs smooth and everything is great!",
"I've had it three months, and it has been glitchy and inconsistent the whole time. It doesn't consistently start up without being plugged in (yes, it is charged). Now it has started turning off without warning. As a matter of fact, right now it is fully charged. If I unplug it, it will just turn off, not shut down, just turn off. When it's on and working, great! The battery life has been great as well -- on the occasions that I've been able to use it unplugged.  I work with people who love their Surface laptops. I am fairly frustrated. I'm a user, not very technical.",
"This is a laptop I will use for years.  It has been extremely reliable for me and still performs at top speed, love it!!",
"I read a lot of bad reviews, mine came in perfect condition, exactly what I ordered. I am using it writing the review right now lol

The color is so beautiful, I love it. I got the burgundy one.",
Good computer but on my laptop all sites ask me to turn on java and i cant find it i dont know if there something wrong with it or its me that dont know how to use it,
"This laptop looks great, light weight and has a great screen.  However, every time I'm busy working and searching it freezes up on me.  I have to shut the computer down completely because the restart button doesn't work, it just takes me through a crazy loop.  This happens often and it's very frustrating.",
"Love it so far. I've only had it for about two weeks - but it works well. I'm pleased with the laptop - boots FAST - pretty easy setup.  Light weight is nice and I purchased a docking station and hooked it up to my specialty keyboard and mouse.  Added a 34"" monitor and all works great so far!",
"Its super light super handy and of course its a microsoft!! I love everything about this laptop and the color so I am reviewing it according to my taste and opinion, it all depends on every person how it will fit them. I use it for work because my employers are super super cheap wont provide work laptops!!",
Screen quality is poor. The colors are too reddish. Another concern it that there is only one USB port.,
"Battery life is not as advertised of up to 14 hours (6 hours is the MAX battery life). Very disappointed. We have made every attempt to increase the battery life by adjusting the screen brightness to minimum, turned off the wifi and bluetooth, yet we can't exceed 6 hours of battery life.

Be Very Cautious.",
"Not sure why people are giving this bad reviews. I personally love this laptop. Very high quality and super light weight. On top of that, it looks darn sexy. This laptop is more attractive than me. Also very fast. I use some heavy software and it does a fantastic job. Overall very happy",
"I love this laptop. Although it's two generations behind, it meets my needs very well as I mostly use it for school (no gaming). It's really fast and the typing experience is by far the best. Overall it's just excellent. I'm never getting a Mac again.",
"Love this laptop.

I had a Surface Pro, but hated it due to the small screen size, small battery, and substandard keyboard. This laptop takes all the best features of the Surface Pro and adds to it. Sleek and slim form factor. Spectacular screen. Good battery life. The only slight knock is a lack of ports, but this isn't an important factor for me.",
"Excellent build quality. I have absolutely no reservations about the Surface Laptop. I think its better than the Surface Book I own. Microsoft got it right on this one.

Positives: Fabric on top of the keyboard, quiet, all metal build, small and thin, fast.

Note: I would suggest upgrading it to Windows 10 Pro from Windows 10 S. Its currently free to this at this time.",
"I bought this laptop around October of 2019. Reading all of the great reviews, I was so excited to buy this laptop. When I saw the case, I could already tell, it was going to be a great laptop. However, I shouldn't of judged the book by its cover. For a few days, it was working like a regular laptop would. I thought that it would bend back all the way with the touchscreen, but I was fine with that. I played games. I did business. I took care of my computer. However, in November, It starts to fail. My gaming slows down, business is harder to run, EVERYTHING. I still use this laptop, and I will use it to the fullest, however. I won't be buying another one of Microsoft's laptops (I will buy the Microsoft processor however, lol.) again. To all that hate my comment, I wont reply to any of them, and I have no feelings against those comments. Sorry Microsoft, I didn't want you to disappoint me like this.",
This is an amazing laptop the only reason I didn't give it 5 star is because the GHz is 2.50 when the description said 4 GHz,
"This was a very disappointing purchase, after setting up all of the initial stuff, which was fairly easy the computer started an update, I get that this is common and proceeded to add email information, sync some other things, etc.  the screen resolution was amazing and I truly thought that I would enjoy this laptop....until I shut it down for the night, when I started it back up the next day I was unable to log in, my husband made several calls during the day while I was at work to see if it was something that could be fixed, we did a system reset and started the whole process of setting it up again....thought that two times would be a charm...boy was I wrong, exact same issue.  Google searches show that the problem we had is an ongoing issue with this system and there aren’t really any answers to help a novice like me to fix.  I have now returned it and decided to go with something that I know is reliable.",
I paid US $ 1250 for this item and it didn't work without being plugged into the wall. this is a waste of money.,
Market place sucks however much of things I actually use it for music and Microsoft word and movie watching is amazing ..nice sleek design as well,
"Great computer. Super fast, looks great. I wish it had more ports though. It was easy and free to switch to Windows 10 Pro. Overall though very happy with this laptop.",
"The laptop looks stunning, the burgundy color is just right, not too flashy not too dark, perfectly right. Besides the looks, the feel is also premium. Performance is enough for daily task: mail, excel, works, powerpoint, browsing etc...etc...
However my device got battery failure within 1 week, I contacted customer support and got replacement within 1 week however all my data is loss which is still quite frustrated.",
"First one I received fully crashed within 4 months, Microsoft has the worst customer service I've ever dealt with.  Amazon was great to deal with and sent a replacement, love the computer when its working, hopefully the second one lasts longer than 4 months",
"Actually my favorite part is the A I. Its Cortana from the game Halo. The first game I ever played when I was 10.
This laptop also has a lot of storage (SSD), a lot of memory (RAM) and the I7 processor so it is very fast.
It its aesthetically pleasing as well",
"I was hesitant to buy a laptop online and to buy a Microsoft laptop but I am so glad I did. This is by far the best laptop I have ever had. It runs smooth, has great features, solid construction, and is great to look at. I have had numerous people ask me about it and are considering buying one for themselves",
"When i fitst bought it. Did not turn on for 5 hours idk why. I was charging it and thought it was defect. But then turned on after and did not have problem. If you are looking to play game, press back button and look for something else. This is good for work purppse.and battery wise, like it said 10 hours plus, no. Maybe 5hours max. 4hours if u working on it.",
"The Surface Laptop is a great device.  Nice and light for traveling.  We use our often on the road.  No issues at all.  Streams easily through our phones when using them as a hot spot.  Form factor is perfect.  The keys are nice to type on - not too clicky, not too soft.",
"This is a great Windows laptop. I wish it had come with a little documentation (especially for how to take advantage of the free upgrade to Windows 10 Pro), but Microsoft support was able to take care of that for me. It feels and performs great. I had ordered a Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 with an i7 processor, and that got too hot to comfortably use in my lap on the sofa. The Surface laptop is perfect for me.",
"This is NOT NEW, they did a very passable job of refurbishing the item. But I have same computer for work and got mine new. There’s little packaging things that are off like a hair on the keyboard. There should be a piece of fitted cloth between the screen and keyboard and there would be a sticky plastic on the charger. I will probably keep it, I just wish it was as advertised",
"This really is an excellent product from Microsoft, proud owner of this machine since August 2017, never lets me down, incredible battery lifetime, totally silent and really thin! I've owned loads of laptops and this one tops them all. I also own the latest Microsoft Surface Pro (not the laptop) because I couldn't decide between these beasts. I really like them both, a really good hardware and overall goods products by Microsoft. They hit the sweet spot with these machines. Highly recommended!",
"Great value from Amazon Warehouse, but keep in mind your warranty period may be less than the full amount since the clock starts ticking from the time the device is first purchased.  This reminder should accompany all Amazon Warehouse items.  The laptop itself is brilliant - I love it.",
I am accustomed to Apple products so my review may be biased.  I type on the Microsoft and sometimes it automatically retypes the word so I have to delete.  I never could figure out how to print from it even though my printer was inside it.  Folders are hard to find.  The mail list jumps around.  I love having the trash icon in the same box with the mail.,
I was sceptical about whether or not I should be purchasing this laptop on a sale and with the reviews it had back then. Thankfully I did it and am loving the laptop. I've been using it for over 5 months now and there were no problems whatsoever. The package arrived when they said it would and with no problems or complications. I truly recommend the device.,
"Update: after 18 months of use. Had charger problems, then finally resolved by buying a few, then 10 days ago it became so slow to be unusable. I only used for browsing, no gaming, no high use programs. Did reset, looked on MS support, cleaned, defragged, you name it, it takes literally 2 or 3 minutes to load one website.

I loved this laptop until recent weeks when the charger (I thought) seemed to fail. Ordered a non MS replacement here and after a week that failed also, so I ordered the official MS version of the charger and after a few days that failed too. Now it's obvious there is something within the computer itself that is causing this, no way are all these chargers failing including the official one. Since it's four months since purchase seems I have no recourse! Do NOT buy this without getting some kind of warranty with it! There was no option for warranty when I purchased mine.",
"highlights: portability (this laptop is extremely lightweight!) and the screen resolution is phenomenal
lowlights: the intel i5 processor isn’t as fast as I would like it to be. it is especially slow on YouTube. the soft material feels nice but i’d rather have an aluminum material so i can clean it a lot easier.",
"I was searching online and on amazon for a reasonably priced, light weight, high quality laptop for school. When I came across this laptop I read through reviews and saw most of them were great! It arrived in a timely manner and I absolutely love it! It has been great so far, very happy with my purchase :) I would definitely recommend it to everyone who’s looking.",
"Amazing product, the materials are great. Feels that it is a premium quality.
The battery may disappoint you because in tech specs you can see that it will work 14.5 hours. As for me I couldn't get from it more than 8 hours.
It may heat if you will play games, then you need some additional cooling.
Also the screen ratio is 2x3 that is great for work. But for movies it may be not as wide as you would like.
Touch screen is great, very responsible. To keyboard and touch pad there is no complaints.",
Nice and slender and meets my needs,
Overall its been a good laptop. Working well. No hangs. But the charger has stopped working properly after only 6 months. I had heard from friends who had the charger problem with their microsoft laptops.,
"Overall it's a very nice laptop -- light, thin, with a very nice screen and a great keyboard. I'll just mention one downside: the i7 version gets HOT, uncomfortably hot to leave it on your lap (especially if you're wearing shorts!). I'll look for an option to slow the processor while I'm running it on battery, which might reduce the heat a bit without killing performance. All thin laptops have this issue, but just wanted to point it out.",
"battery life is about 6 hours, and it has a battery saving mode. Great for if you are on the go. The touch screen works really well, unless you get something on the screen. (It becomes unhappy, just clean it) The brightness setting is really useful, and the computer is super light. Makes school traveling much easier!",
"I got the platinum version, and I won’t lie I thought the alcantara was dirty when it just came. Came to realize that the material does play tricks on your eyes causing you to think it’s dirty when it’s not.

Alcantara is a really unique touch but it gets dirty really fast, especially with oils/sweaty palms. Hard to clean, especially with that special illusion it’s little trickery. You’ll be there wiping it off for hours.

Cleaning isn’t as difficult if you use a cotton ball soaked in alcohol.",
The laptop I received had some technical issues but it was promptly replaced. My grandson uses this for his online Zoom college classes and could not be happier with it. The touch screen is a huge plus and the weight & size are perfect to transport to and from class.  I highly recommend Micro Direct Deals for your laptop needs.,
"I got my first computer in 1985, a Kapro, and it was about as sophisticated as a World War 2 Jeep. The Microsoft Surface Laptop feels like I stepped into a Rolls Royce; compared to the Surface, everything else feels like a WW-2 Jeep. The touch screen is an incredible luxurious feature and it's amazing how Microsoft managed to get so much power into such a light and beautiful machine. As a writer, Its touch and overall performance brings out the creative spirit in me.",
"Still cant print, prints solid black page. Apparently a problem in Windows 10. Figured out how to print from my Android. Pretty soon wont use a laptop if they make it this hard to do simple functions.",
"I bought this laptop for school. and for the most part, it does its job. The only complaint I have is that because its a bit dated browsers like Chrome run slowly on it compared to newer laptops.
Also, a thing to note, check the specs of your laptop when you get it. I don't know if it is intentional but I have a feeling its more than likely just pure incompetence. But they will often send you a product with different specs than what you actually paid for.
Like if you paid for a laptop with a 3.1 GHz processor ($100 more in value) and all you get one with a 2.5 GHz processor.",
"This computer may be my favorite purchase from Amazon...ever!  I had a Microsoft Surface Pro for work for 4 years and decided to purchase this as a personal laptop.  I am extremely happy with this purchase.

P.S. - I wasn't at home when the delivery came, so I had to go to UPS to pick up my package.  A minor inconvenience for time, but it did give me some piece of mind that my package was not sitting on my front step all day.",
"I would have given it 5* review, however, the first one that I bought was defective. When I was setting up the PC, it got stuck on UEFI loop. Tried hard reboot many times but unsuccessful. Called the dealer about the issue, Luis was very good and helpful in resolving the problem. Got it replaced very quickly.",
"Was looking for an easy-to-use and straightforward laptop for my wife who has very general everyday use and this was perfect. It’s very light weight, compact, and great for non-tech savvy person. The laptop even came in brand new condition wrapped and boxed. It can get overwhelming searching the internet and even Amazon for a computer. The reviews are up and down and everyone has different preferences. This is a great product because it’s made by windows so you can trust it’s manufactured well like a MacBook would be.",
This computer is AMAZING. the best computer I have ever owned. I was a little nervous about the mailing process after reading a few reviews but I decided to take a chance. They sent me the right computer and it was almost fully charged when it got to me so you know it wasn’t sitting around for too long. Every claim that Microsoft has made that I have read about this computer is true. Great computer to use for college. Holds a charge very well and runs pretty quickly. Very impressed.,
"I received my Surface laptop but waiting three weeks before using it as I was in the middle of a project on my old computer.  Three weeks into use, there was a hardware malfunction; the keyboard and mouse stopped working. Microsoft more or less willingly sent me a replacement and, after a 10 day wait, I was ready to go again. This time, however, the new machine came with an ""S"" code which means that ONLY MS software can be installed on it. The tech people insisted I run a diagnostic only AFTER which they admitted there was a software problem that they would need to fix. Timeline on that? Sometime between now and whenever. Meanwhile, critical non-MS software is unavailable to me. MS is very sorry for my inconvenience and lost work time and they will get back to me via email...someday.

Meanwhile, the third party who sold me this electronic piece of fecal material told me to go whistle because their return policy was only for 30 days. Not their fault although they should at least warn people about the problem.

Finally, there is only one USB port which is weird and annoying. This means I had to purchase and carry with me a dongle that supports additional ports. Also, the machine lacks niceties like a fingerprint sign on. I am a bit sorry I did not look more carefully at the specs. Of course, the specs would not have clued me in on the larger hardware and software problems.",
"I've been a devoted Windows user since the early 90s. In parallel, and in counterpoint, I've also cycled through countless Windows laptops over the years, including Compaq, HP and Dell, and often been disappointed with the longevity of the machines. I nevertheless retained my affinity for the Windows operating system---so much so that when I purchased a MacBook Pro last year, I partitioned the disk and continued operating under Windows 10. I therefore greeted news of the Surface Laptop this spring---with its sleek and unitary design, and integration with other Microsoft products---with great enthusiasm. At last, I thought, the hardware would rise to the level of the software. The Surface Laptop would be Microsoft's answer to Apple.

Alas, upon buying the machine (indeed, the highest-end model), I found myself severely disappointed.

First of all, it ran noisy and hot right out of the box. Second, I could not even obtain a full-screen display on a standard Samsung external monitor (a defect which could not be resolved through a lengthy call to Microsoft Tech Support). How could Microsoft overlook such a basic requirement?

After several hours of struggling I put the machine back in the box and returned it for a full refund. From Microsoft, I expected much better.",
"I am an intense user and the Surface Laptop is the best laptop I owned so far. Upgraded it to Win 10 Pro since I need a wide variety of software on the machine for professional use (Image processing, CAD, etc.). The upgrade was free and easy. The keyboard is very precise and comfortable, allowing for fast typing. Mouse and touch screen very accurate. The display is crisp with natural colors. Processor and SSD performance is ample. Beautiful detail solutions like the power supply plug and the additional USB charging port in the power supply add to the appeal. And the design is clean, minimalist, beautiful.
I hope I will have this laptop for a very long time!",
"First of all, the supplier did an excellent delivery job.
I was upgrading from a 12 year old laptop built for XP.  Going to the 1st Gen Surface Laptop was like going to the moon.  Once you get WIFI connected, be prepared for update mania.  You'll go from version 1709 updates, to 1803 and then 1903 with no problems.
Also, it will take a while for the battery to be fully charged.  I'm running on battery now to see how long it lasts.
FYI, mine came with the Pro version and the i7 7660U.",
"This is my favorite laptop I've ever owned! At $640.00 for a fully-spec'd and refurbished Surface Laptop, it's a steal considering a brand new one goes for about $750.00 as of 5/23/19. If you like doing light to moderate gaming but primarily use it for HD streaming, web development, remote work, or browsing, this is beautiful and comfortable laptop to work one with high battery life and a well above average price-to-power ratio.",
"Pros: Solid build, fancy color. Smooth keyboard and touch pad. Screen quality is amazing, sharp and bright. Speakers sound great. Everything feels pretty fast. Light as heck.
However:
- Not for gaming, only for work and school
- Need to switch out of Windows S mode
- Light-colored fabric can get dirty after using for a long period of time
- Sometimes it's not that fast (especially if you are extremely sensitive to lags). Maybe it's just me because I have had a strong gaming laptop before (and we all know that gaming laptop is really fast)",
"First of all I like design, it feels very smooth and keyboard is great. screen resolution is great, I like colors and laptop has wonderful sound, but it cant support CAD files as I expected. Its not for gaming too, I tryed Skyrim and it was lugging. Even though I like it and I think that It is a great price for this kind of laptop. Oh, once more: windows updates is killing me.",
"I put 5 for gaming but i don't game at all so idk but everything else is 5 star. I'm a nursing student and do photography and planning weddings and need my computer for literally everything. Great price, amazingly true to color, very lightweight and high quality. Fast with lots of storage. Links to my phone which makes things easy to track and fits in literally any bag and goes everywhere with me. I love this laptop. Best investment I ever made. Only down side is that i'd like a disk drive - CD - but I function without.",
"So it has been a year since I've bought this lovely product and it is by the far the best decision to buy. This laptop is a lot different than my previous one and a nice change.

The touchscreen is new to me and it's nice to play around with it, especially using it to do my signatures on documents and papers. The battery life is excellent and the performance has been awesome. It's also thin enough to fit with your books and binders in a school bag.

The only issue that I have with it is the lack of certain USB ports like a USB-C slot.",
"I purchased the i7, 8GB RAM, and 256GB memory. The laptop is lighter than my previous Surface, the Surface 1st Gen. The quality of the keyboard is much nicer than the first generation so there's definitely been a lot of upgrades. I love the feel and the quality of the laptop. The battery lasts pretty long when I have multiple tabs open. Very short delay when starting up the surface. Very quick to shut down as well. The laptop restarts in about 20 seconds. Love how quick the laptop is when changing tabs despite having multiple programs open. All in all, I love this laptop and the price is even better.",
"Mine came with windows 10 pro, which is superb (no update needed).

The best thing ever! It’s worth every buck and I can finally work in a fast pace. I don’t think I’ll ever own another laptop again. I’m never a MacBook person person, and Microsoft totally rocked this one.

I went for 16gb ram for fast usage and it’s pretty speedy. I love the face recognition and haven’t used the touch screen yet.

Recently purchased a cover to protect which is something I highly recommend. This is a great investment laptop and for those who seek the best quality. I’ll choose Microsoft surface for life.",
"Decided to upgrade from a less powerful surface to this one, a bit unsure as linux had to be tweaked a bit but so far it's been awesome. Portable and cheap price compared to Mac but still a lot of power and if you are a linux fan there an available Kernel with just all you need. I've got docker, rails server, node server, Android studio and the devise simulator running with no harm. No sound, and the keyboard is really comfortable.  The texture adds an extra bit of comfort and the keystroke is perfect. Recommended if you looking for something light with a lot of power",
"I have the cobalt blue, & have had it for several weeks, I couldn't be more impressed with this laptop! The screen is incredibly vibrant, sound quality is very nice, and lighting behind the keys is absolutely wonderful! The material on the keyboard is a nice touch as well, I wasn't so sure about it before my purchase, but once my package came, I learned to love it as well. The fact that this laptop weighs less than 3 pounds is also a huge bonus! The magnet that the power cord plugs is surprisingly strong too. Over all I give this product 5/5 stars",
"Battery broke in a 1.5 years and the only way to deal with it is to get a refurbished laptop exchange from Microsoft with a fee of $450... so I have a choice of either loosing all my personal loval data and getting another old laptop for a fee or pay about the same for data recovery and buy a completely new laptop .... in the meantime, microsoft chargers have been breaking every few months. Microsoft quality is not the best.",
"I was in the market for a new laptop, and had done some research on the best 13 in laptops.  The surface was always mentioned and got very high reviews....I just didn't want to spend  $1200.  The first Gen Surface Laptop went on sale a few weeks for under $800 and I decided I'd take a chance and order it.. Great purchase.  8GB of RAM 256 SSD...beautiful screen.  I know it has a fan, but I have yet to hear it.  Yes, it's lacking in ports, but for what I use it for its perfect...If you can find the 1st Gen at this price buy it, you won't be sorry.",
"I have had no problems with this device and I like almost everything about it.  It is light and fast.  The keyboard is comfy.  the main reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that Microsoft insists on the proprietary power cord.  there is no way to use a portable battery charger. it is all or none,  It makes no sense.  At least they could supply a usb proprietary cable for external battery pack use.  Fortunately this is not a big problem for me but for some it could be a deal breaker. If you had to go more than a day away from a standard outlet you would be SOL.  UPDATE 4/2019  I found a power cord aftermarket that solve the problem.  I lowered the star rating because the camera is now malfunctioning and that is something I used a lot.  after 9 mmonths the camera should work.",
"I love this laptop. I was a little bit skeptical ordering off of Amazon and not directly from Microsoft but I was looking for a nice replacement to my old laptop. The quality of this laptop is AMAZING. The keyboard is a nice change from cold metal/plastic and feels like a quality product. Compared to other devices that I have used, the screen quality is one of the best for under $1000. I highly recommend this product if you're doing some light gaming (Sims, CS:GO, Etc.) and can run lightroom + photoshop with ease. I really do not have any complaints when it comes to this laptop. I will update in the future if anything happens!",
"Had this for about six months and so far it has been a great purchase. Very good display, responsive touch screen, good quality keyboard making typing very comfortable. The CPU is fast enough for casual use like web browsing, YouTube, Netflix, Photoshop, etc. Would not recommend for stuff like video editing or heavy gaming. The only issue was the charger that came with it, it's of terrible quality and stopped working for me after just 4 months of use and had to buy a new one. But, overall for the price this is a great product.",
"This is a Microsoft laptop.  The description says it comes with Windows and Office, two Microsoft Products.  One would think that it is just a 30-day trial subscription.  And, they want you on Windows 365 and Office 2016--the latest Microsoft items.  As a consultant, I need a computere that is on the same platform as my client.  Microsoft Customer Service tried to figure out how I could get Office 2010 versus 2016....regardless, when we were close to thinking we might be successful, I asked the representative to stay on the line to make sure it worked.  They hung up.  It didn't work.  Relied on my former IT husband to Google his way around the issues.  It is not a great sync with my dear beloved Mac.  I've been using HPs/Compacts in the last three jobs.  My parents have issues all the time with their Surface, I blamed it on old age.  They blame it on frequent updates and having to resolve issues because of the updates.  Go figure.",
"So far, one of the most beautiful computing devices I have owned so far. That's a real statement considering I have owned more than 15 laptops in the past decade.

The screen is a stunner, touchpad and keyboard are simply fantastic and the sound is surprisingly loud and clear. The ports leave a lot to be desired but isn't a deal breaker. Although I have yet to confirm true daily performance and battery life, so far it has been overwhelmingly positive. I only felt this when I had ordered the Dell XPS ultrathin but was quickly reminded of its deal breaking limitations.

You'll want to show this off and will equally enjoy using it as your daily driver. Definitely remember to use the free upgrade to Windows 10 pro until the S version has a store that is well populated with the most critical windows apps for power users and general users alike.",
"I am an IT Manager who oversees 7 different locations, and 160 employees. We are a Microsoft shop, running Azure, Office 365, and SharePoint. We used to be Dell, with regards to hardware. These devices are fast, reliable, light weight, and as durable as any other tablet style device you will find. The battery life is incredible. I have users on them 8 solid hours, never an issue. Yes, they are higher price, but you get what you pay for. I do have a 3 years accidental on all devices. I've only had a single issue in 3 years with them.  A user left theirs on the roof of their car and it slide off and damaged the screen, obviously not fault of the device. I personally run a Surface Pro i7 with 512 Memory, and I love it.",
"Very nice piece of hardware.  I few minor complaints: Not nuts about how the charge cable interfaces with the laptop.. not as good as the maglock system but macs use but better than the typical connector.  It is short on ports.  Display Port, USB3 and a headphone jack... and thats it.  I wish for a built card reader when I forget to bring my USB card reader.

Aside from those complaints, its great.  Great keyboard, great track pad and HOLYSHITAWESOME SCREEN.  Looks great and 3:2 aspect ratio is so great for actual productivity.

Great battery life and highly portable size and weight.

Tight integration between OS and hardware shows.. everthing just works.",
"I bought this laptop for college and I think I made a good choice. It's really lightweight so it won't be too heavy carrying it around. It has a touchscreen which is helpful for zooming in. The screen is also more vertical than other laptops so it seems bigger. At first I was iffy about the alcantara but it actually looks quite nice in person. The only thing is that the keys are heavier than I thought they would be. I prefer lighter keys because they help me type faster, but I've already gotten used to these ones. I would recommend getting the silver color because you can always add laptop skins (and the grey alcantara will match with more skins than the blue or burgundy).",
"I wanted a laptop with 16gb of ram and an Intel i7 processor - this one was recommended and price was manageable.  Yes, it is pretty, sleek and fast but after the first month I started having problems with it. The first time it crashed I was able to pinpoint the most likely cause as Windows updates. There were a few that failed, then laptop continually crashed, had to re-build my profile twice. It slowly went downhill from there. None of the drivers would update. I know my way around a laptop (spent my career supporting workstations and laptops) so I started with the simplest fix and worked my way up. Could not reset or restore. Fortunately I purchased a warranty and they put me in touch with a very knowledgeable person at Microsoft and we re-built from scratch  to Windows 10 Pro (10.0.19042 build 19042). Everything has been fine for a while but now it randomly crashes with an error of ""WHEA uncorrectable error"" which fortunately doesn't harm my profile but is almost impossible to identify the cause. I've run tests on memory and the hard drive and they seem to be fine. Very annoying and unstable, and this is the laptop I have to use for the next few years? I'm ready to go back to my old. slow HP Elitebook. Not a happy camper.",
"I am very satisfied with my Surface Laptop purchase. I was looking for a portable laptop that I could also use as my desktop. I had been deciding between the Surface Pro and Surface Laptop. After trying both, I found that I preferred the typing experience on the laptop. I ended up waiting for the Surface Laptop to go on sale and I got the Core i5, 8 GB Ram, 256 GB model. I have been very happy so far. I generally have multiple applications open (word, excel, internet, email) and this laptop is suitable for my use. I am also using a Surface Dock to that I connect to two external monitors. It took some trial and error to get it working, but it was worth it. I did convert to Windows 10 Pro (For Free) and it allows me to use my Google accounts. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase.",
"I just got this today so I may update the review if need be. Here’s what I’ve gathered this far.
I purchased the surface 1 with 4 ghz intel i7, 8 gb ram, 256 internal storage.
I immediately checked the laptop specks & it is all that it says EXCEPT the 4 ghz. This laptop says 2.5 ghz. Something to keep in mind.
It comes packaged very well & very closely resembles a Mac on size, look & feel. It seems to run rather quickly. I’m a photographer and intend to use it for photoshop so I will update later on how well that works. Overall I’m pleased. I’d definitely suggest a protection plan as this is a third party purchase.",
"I bought this laptop for school. I was really nervous about buying online, but this laptop is absolutely wonderful. The battery has lasted me two full days without a charge. I have watched Netflix, YouTube, and been on email and had other tab open. It is so quiet when it's running, super thin, and light weight. The fabric on the keyboard feels really nice and keeps my hands from feeling gross after typing for long periods of time (though the fabric kinda smells like a new car). The touch screen is very responsive and dont have to press hard. The keys under hand feel really nice and aren't loud when typing (so doesn't sound like a tap dancer). It came earlier that expected in very secure box and laptop box was in plastic as well. Only complaint, which really isn't horrible at all, is that  the charger dislodges from port occasionally and stops charging while it was in my lap.",
"I debated for a long time whether or not to upgrade from my Surface Pro 4 to this.... I am so happy I took the plunge and upgraded.
I purchased the burgundy colored one and LOVE IT. It's beautiful. Also, compared to my previous Surface Pro 4, the battery lasts FOREVER. I love not depending on a kickstand to keep the screen up, I love how fast it is, I love how long the battery lasts. Couldn't be happier.

With all this being said, the first Surface Laptop I ordered worked great for a while, then suddenly had a red vertical line through the screen that wouldn't go away. It was determined that it ended up being a hardware issue. I had babied it so it wasn't caused by damage or rough handling. Ergo it must have been some kind of a manufacturers defect. I returned it through Amazon and ordered another once the return was processed. Taking this into consideration, I am still very happy with my purchase.",
"Wow, the battery life was totally not what i expected. The battery life the ads give say about 14 hours, and i knew it wasnt really going to be 14, but i thought maybe at least 10 hours, or even 8! But nooo.... i get 4 hours of battery life... 4. Hours! Yes, i did switch to the pro, but still! Ridiculous. For $1000 i thought at least 6? I really hope they fix this, cause that's really sad. Macbooks get way more. Hp zenbook gets more. But the screen is amazing, beautiful and the keyboard is nice, mouse pad is smooth. And alcantra....it's a nice concept, but man does it get dirty and it absorbs the sweat from the palms. Oh yeah, the keyboard really collects the oils from your fingers, so does the mousepad, unfortunately.",
"Having used a surface pro 3, then 4 for the past few years I was ready to try the new surface laptop. The surface book was a bit too heavy . With the sp4's I opted for the i5 with 16gb ram to extend battery life. Also the i7 on the surfaces pro 4 were getting too hot. With the surface laptop I ended up with a i7, 16gb ram it's a bit pricey but it's a work horse and probably best laptop I've had for travel.

I do miss the sp4's ability to remove the keyboard and adjust the rear especially in the plane when I can stick it in the seat pocket. Also a bit getting used to having the dock/power mount on the bottom near the keys vs the screen on the sp4.

The bigger screen and better keyboard is a nice welcome after so many years with a surface pro

For power users I would also recommend the stylus, a usb3 Ethernet adapter as it also provides 3 usb3 slots and an 'active' mini displayport to HDMI .

I do wish it had a usb-c slot sometimes .",
Had issues charging it after unboxing it. Found out that it needed to be updated and I guess part of the updates were a fix for the charging issue. After downloading the updates it wouldn’t install then since it’s not plugged in. Well it’s plugged in but it’s got issues. So I took a can of air duster and pray the charging port a little and it did the trick and starting charging. After it installed the updates and rebooted. The charging issue was gone. This laptop is not upgradable. It scored a score of 0 out of 10 on ifixit. Don’t game with it. You’ll be disappointed. But light gaming will work fine like Minecraft. Surprisingly it was able to play GTA V decently. But I wouldn’t push it. This is a very premium device. It looks great and feels great. You’ll like the keyboard as well. I got the burgundy color. It looks really nice in person. So if you’re in the market for one. I would avoid getting the ones with 4gb of ram. 8gb of ram is the sweet spot for today’s use.,
"To start off, I was supposed to get a $200 gift card for the purchase of this item, which I didn't, and Amazon would not work with me regarding the promotion (which is the only reason I considered buying this laptop). I will not judge the actual item based on my poor experience with Amazon.

This laptop is great. I took naturally to the touchscreen, but you can function on the laptop without the touchscreen (I realize some people do not like to ""ruin"" the screen). Some things may bother you though.

NO CD ROM. I lucked out in that I could download all the previous apps I had, but if you require a CD, you will need to buy an external CD ROM drive to run the apps, and to burn CD's.

ONLY 1 USB PORT. So I had to buy a splitter. Personally bought it to be able to use a mouse and keyboard, although I find it comfortable typing on the laptop's keyboard.

Overall, I've had it for over a month and I love it. No major problems, very fast so long has you have a decent internet condition. I have a lot of apps and files that I transferred with no problem and the computer is still running great.",
"The last laptop that I had was the Lenovo Yoga 2 so it had Windows OS. When I was looking for a new laptop (I had my Lenovo for a little more than 4 years) I narrowed it down between the Microsoft Surface Laptop and the Google Pixelbook. Both laptops were around the same price (the Pixelbook is slightly cheaper than the Surface), with similar specs. At first, I was leaning more towards the Pixelbook because of the slightly cheaper price, but I didn't like that the Pixelbook was a 2-in-1 (my Lenovo is also a 2-in-1 and while I liked this feature at first, it ended up becoming a problem down the road). I also read some reviews about the Pixelbook that said there were some software issues. All the reviews that I read about the Surface were extremely positive with only minor complaints that seemed as though they would be irrelevant for me. Because I was relying heavily on past reviews (I live in the middle of nowhere and was not able to make the drive to view either laptop in person) I ended up going with the Surface despite the higher price and I have absolutely no regrets.

The Surface is sleek and smooth and I LOVE that there are multiple colors to choose from! The fabric-covered keyboard is sooo soft and smooth, and the laptop itself is unbelievably thin! The Surface ticks all the boxes for me, and although I cringed at spending this much on a laptop, I am so glad that I did!

The only thing that I would note is that there is only one USB port, which isn't an issue for me, but I know some people prefer more than one. Other than that, I can think of no complaints thus far.",
"I got this laptop about a month ago and I LOVE it (there's a pros and cons list at the bottom of review). I needed something portable, quiet, and with good battery life because I am a college student. It's very light and I like the stylish design. I wanted a laptop that's aesthetically pleasing and has good specs. I can even play minecraft with my brothers without any issues. The laptop does get a bit hot when running minecraft or running multiple programs at once but the fans are always quiet usually making no noise at all. I went from a huge, heavy old dell to this laptop and it's great. It makes my life so much easier. Also on the power brick there is an extra USB port which I sometimes plug my phone into to charge. I've never seen that feature before and it's surprisingly handy.

The only issue I've had is with the trackpad. There's some visible wear on the trackpad already.  However, it doesn't really bother me as it's very minor and you can only really see it in a certain light. Other than that the trackpad has worked fine. A possible issue could be that there is only one USB port which I don't mind at all. But if you use more than one at a time then this laptop may not be for you.

Pros: Light, good battery, very quiet, fast, aesthetically pleasing, powerful considering it's lightweight design
Cons: trackpad wear, one usb port, gets hot when running multiple programs",
Bought as a replacement laptop and it has out performed the laptop it replaced. Best electronics purchase in a long time. Love it!,
"I've been a Mac User for more than 15 years.  The price convinced y to try a Surface.  Works beautifully, reacts promptly, amazing touch screen, wakes up fast  and it is very light.  The keyboard is  backlit  so you can work in the dark and the  touch pad is a smooth as Apple's.  However, unlike Apple,  Microsoft is aggressively pushing  its own products.  The browser Edge works nicely and you can select which  search engine the  can use. (The default search engine is Bing.)  The AI helper Cortana uses only Bing. At  this moment  Cortana is less impressive than Google's Assistant. It is still very useful.

Microsoft is also offering a competitive cloud  cloud subscription.  At my job  I have to use Google cloud products (Drive,  Sheets, Documents). Also I have an Android Phone and  Google Photo  helps me sync my photo collection. These products  don't work as smoothly on the Surface.  At this moment you cannot even install the Chrome browser  on  Surface. (I read that Chrome is more energy consuming than Edge and can shorten the battery life.)  I do not need Microsoft cloud service since I already use two platform independent services  Google Drive and  Dropbox. I don't need  all the facilities of  Office 363 (the new Microsoft Office) since I can live very well with what  Google is offering freely.  I  don't know yet how Dropbox works with Surface.

Given the current deliberate  incompatibility with the Google products I need I gave Surface only four stars. If Microsoft  fixes this I will upgrade my rating to five stars  and switch to Surface.T hen again, I hear that Apple  will present this Fall the new generation of Mac Book Air.",
"First of all, i want to start by expressing how much i liked the product, its looks and feels like a solid midrange laptop for everyday use. The design is sleek and simple, i was disappointed with the fact that it is difficult to find a simple laptop that doesn’t cost an arm and a leg. All in all i liked the laptop, a lot! *The rating is for the product* not the for the story below

However, the main purpose of this review is not about the laptop’s performance, design etc... its about how I got scammed and was sent a laptop with specs that I didn’t order.

So the story goes like this, i get on amazon, I add a Microsoft surface laptop (i5, 8 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD) to my cart, i place the order, several days later I get the package, i set up the laptop started checking it out. I had a feeling that i should check out the computer’s spec, you know just curious. I was shocked when i found out that the specs of the laptop were (i5, 4 GB RAM and 128 GB SSD!!!!!!!) i was really confused, i double check the label on the back of the box and saw that it says (i5, 8GB RAM, 256 GB SSD), but the laptop has different specs, and what is more confusing is that the serial number of the laptop matches the number on the box. So to me it seemed like it was an attempt to pull a quick one on me. I ended up returning the laptop of course... I am still disappointed that such scam attempts could happen on amazon!

Check your laptops everyone! Don’t get scammed like i did.",
It crushed after almost 4 years.,
"I bought this for my wife to replace her older, bulky, HP laptop. It was a few years old and replacement was due. She picked this one out at a retail store and we found it on Amazon for a reduced price. She LOVES it!! So light, fast, and cute because it's her favorite color. The palm rests have a cloth feeling but they are made of some plastic stuff that's easily cleaned, the screen looks great, and the keyboard feels right... partly due to the palm rests allowing a person to rest palms on them while typing. It has a fast hard drive, it's quiet and light. I really don't have negatives to say about it except that it only has a couple of USB 3 ports. That's OK... I bought a tiny USB 3 hub and we're all good now. Definitely recommend this device though it's not cheap.",
"I know most people cringe when thinking about Microsoft hardware.  There have been some massive failures over the years.  Remember around the time of the first iphone, the Windows Phones on AT&T?  What a mess.  Remember trying to update them?  The Surface line of tablets have actually been pretty good, but in the end most people either just want a really good tablet or a good laptop.  The surface laptops have filled a nice need which is a speedy laptop that is super slim and can act like a tablet as well.  As long as you get the model with at least a core i5, 8 gigs of RAM and 256 SSD, the surface laptop performs great.  You can hold it with 2 or 3 fingers and fits in a tablet sleeve.  I have one of these myself and we have sold about 20 of them for our employees and clients and have had very few issues so far.  The finish on the laptop looks nice, but it can show some fingerprints or new to be wiped off after a lot of use.  The reason I am taking off a star is because of the confusion and frustration of having these laptops ship with Windows 10 S.  I won't bore you with what Windows 10 S is, suffice to say that it is a stripped down version meant for large rollouts and not suitable for most people.  It's true that you can switch to Windows 10 Pro for free, but it's super confusing for people that don't know how or why they need to do that.  Overall while not perfect, for the price the surface laptop is a great choice.",
"I could not connect my Surface to a shared printer (see below).  My time with Microsoft support did not resolve my issue.  Printing is important, and I felt the 2 stars was deserved for a product I might have had to return.

After a few hours of working with it, I was able to resolve my problem.  This is what I experienced.  Your Surface may not experience the same issue.  It might have been a one off, or a bug of some kind.

My 5 existing computers had the ""Workgroup"" name changed to ""XXXXXXXXX"".  After updating the Surface to WIndows Pro at the Microsoft Store, I changed the ""Workgroup"" name to match the other 5.  At that point, it failed to connect to a shared printer.  Long story short, I set the ""Workgroup"" name back to ""WORKGROUP"" on the Surface and the computer with the printer attached, and it worked!

So, I changed the ""Workgroup"" name back to ""XXXXXXXXX"" on those 2 computers, and it failed to connect to the shared printer again!

I changed all 6 computers so the ""Workgroup"" is named ""WORKGROUP"" and all is good.  This should not have been an issue, but I'm glad I got mine working.

We love the laptop.  It has a great screen size, it is light, and it is quick.  Not excited with my support call with Microsoft, but the important thing is it works now.

ORIGINAL POST:
It started off really nice.  Fast, smooth, it looks great, etc.  Then I tried to connect it to a shared printer on another computer in my home.  It failed.  Over and over again.  I called Microsoft.  The young lady was patient and nice, but went through a series of tests that had nothing to do with my issue.  I requested my call be escalated, and after a few minutes, she came back on and tried a few additional steps.

She had me connect the printer directly to the laptop.  It worked (Who saw that coming????)!  Then she said ""we have it working.  Is there anything else we can do for you?""  I could have done this.  The laptop REFUSES to recognize a shared printer on the network.  I have a Surface Pro 3, a Surface 1, an HP desktop and an HP laptop, ALL which can connect to the printer that is USB'd to another HP desktop.  Microsoft basically REFUSED to escalate my issue even after I said I was sending it back.

It's sad to give it a 2 star rating for a printer issue, but we like to print.  It is not an option.  Someone might say it is a printer issue.  It is not.  There is a network sharing issue with ""MY"" Surface Laptop.  Maybe not yours, but mine has an issue.  It is also sad that Microsoft wouldn't at least attempt to resolve this.

I may return this if I can't find a printer solution.  I'll update in a couple of weeks.",
"I'm only writing this to warn off anyone from purchasing a surface laptop--lord know I'll never buy one. I bought the laptop two years ago. The surface worked fine for the first year, though I had periodic charging issues, especially with the magnetic cable clip. The clip won't engage, sometimes you have to prop it up or tape it. The problems got worse, and just when the warranty expired (a year and half), I had major issues charging the laptop. So I bought another cable, which worked for a while, then bought another, and the problem continued. I had two conversations with microsoft techs, who convinced me to buy another cable--considering, if I wanted to send the laptop for repair, the price would be more than I paid for it, so they really gave me no possible solutions, other than buying a new one, and were really gaslighting me that any fix actually existed. Of course, why would I ever purchase another microsoft product. The Lenovo laptop, which I bought the Surface to replace it with, is still working five years later--only issue I had is with a hinge.

I've taken it to various repair shops and they tell me there's nothing they can do to fix it, that basically, microsoft made the surface to be disposable, and any effort to fix the laptop would far exceed the price to purchase a new one--planned obsolescence. From what I researched, what brought about the charging issue was some update I failed to download, and once the battery lost power,  it couldn't be charged, or even powered with the cable plugged in.

I've given up on this pos. I'm looking for a field where I can take it out and demolish it like the printer from Office Space, or possibly a parking garage I can drop it from. Maybe a wood chipper. I'm weighing my options. All said, don't buy a surface laptop, this is where you'll be two years later.",
"I've had my Microsoft Surface Laptop for about a month now and I genuinely could not be happier with my purchase. After weeks of research and stress trying to find the perfect laptop I stumbled upon this beauty. It was worth the wait and stress or research. It's amazing.

The keyboard is out of this world. It's so comfortable to type on. I love it.

The i7 core processor is amazing. I can run Photoshop, Spotify and a bunch of browsers without it slowing down.

Battery life is phenomenal.

The screen is great. The touch screen works amazingly too.

I got the Burgundy and it's even cuter in person. It's sort of punk pinkish. I love it. The material on the inside is nice, I'm not sure how it will wear eventually but in the meantime it's been great and comfortable.

You won't regret your purchase!

EDIT: almost 2 years later and this computer still works like a charm!!! the fabric inside isn’t worn down and i work from home on it, literally 8 hours a day m-f for the last 2 years! it’s not as new looking, but still in pretty great shape! still runs super fast, amazing. battery life isn’t as strong but not a deal breaker",
"UPDATE: So, I'm about two weeks in now and have had a bit of time to run a few photoshoots into my Lightroom catalog to get an idea of what this laptop can handle and I'm a bit less than ecstatic. I'm not knocking a star off because Adobe recommends 12gb of ram to run Lightroom smoothly, so its no fault to Microsoft that I started to have some slow-downs when I got my catalog up around 1,000 images with synced settings, 1:1 previews, and adjustments gradients and brushes on many files. I've got my cache set to 90gb and it just tends to really chug when I need to do more than basic adjustments. Outside of heavy lightroom use and sluggishness, the laptop absolutely flies with just about anything else. I really don't have a complaint to share. It's been a dream.

This laptop is fantastic. I bought the i5 256/8gb model with the gray/gold coloring. First thing that amazes is the weight. Just over two pounds makes this thing feel so incredible to carry around. I almost feel like it's a large phone sometimes. The design is sleek and minimalist. The speakers are loud and full and rich. The battery life is is superb. I may have a warped view on that because of the terrible battery on my old laptop, but I seem to notice 7-8 hours battery life depending on the usage. I bought this for Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop use, but haven't had much time to put it through a lot of work so I will update when I know just how well it performs there.

The only minor dislike is that the hinge is a little wobbly. For being touchscreen, it seems like it should have a stiffer hinge, but it's quite bouncy.",
"I've had this laptop for about three months, and this is the second laptop (after the Rose Gold MacBook), that I have looked forward to using day in and day out. It is a weird feeling, being in love with your laptop. Most of us have probably own at least 6 laptops in our lifetimes, so you can understand where I'm coming from when I say most of us use our laptops in a utilitarian sort of way: We use it because we need to, and when we don't, we just put it away without any thought. If you want a big screen, or to play games, you would use your desktop. When you want something portable, you would most likely use your tablet. When you want something on the go, we have all used our smartphone as our main day-to-day gadget. So that leaves our laptop, as more of a business machine for doing something that requires typing on the go, whether it be to reply to an important email you can't just use your phone for, or to type out something on Word or Google Docs. For many of us, browsing the Net just isn't as satisfying on our small phones, even if it is some 6.2"" monster. There is something tactile, yet intangibly indescribable, about using our laptop

Yet, this is the first Windows laptop that makes me look forward to using it each day. The main culprit: Oh that gorgeous piece of metal and color. To be honest, if it just came in silver like its Surface Book counterpart, I would have never given it a second thought (by the way, I have that too, but its novelty has since worn off). I got the Burgundy version, which is just so unique - where else can you get a wine red laptop?? Each time I open its laptop sleeve and pull it out, I have to pause a moment to admire its chiseled look first, before propping it open and using it. Not only does it look great, it feels great too. As you run your fingers through it, you will appreciate that you have one of the most luxurious laptops ever. No that is not a hyperbole.

Another thing that make it stands out: The stereo speakers underneath the keyboard is the best I have ever heard in a laptop (I am overseas right now, and my Huawei Matebook X awaits at home with its Dolby Atmos Harmon Kardon speakers, so I'll do an update soon). It is loud and immersive - it can't get too loud where it would create aural distortions, so at its peak it is just awesomely loud and clear enough. I have a keyboard protector over it, but I always take it off when I have some audio playing - yes, the sound is that good.

Touchscreen laptops might be a gimmick, but having it is never a negative. It is perfect for scrolling web sites. Once you use it that way, you'll never go back to scrolling with your mouse or trackpad again.

Speaking of the trackpad, it's supposed to have the Windows Precision software aspect, but it still is goofy most of the time. Scrolling, switching, zooming, etc., still isn't as good as any MacBooks.

And speaking of the keyboard and keyboard cover, key travel and sponginess are excellent. However, the keys are a bit more slippery than I would like, so I definitely recommend one of those gel keyboard covers to help you type more precisely.

The screen is bright and excellent - one of the best screens I have used. The resolution isn't as crisp and nice as my Surface Book and Macbook, but definitely better than most.

About that whole Alcantara-layered interior - yes it is beautiful, yes it feels great (no more cold palms in the winter). Just keep it clean (no eating potato chips while using it).

Finally, the i5 and 8GB of RAM are good enough to avoid any hiccups in performance of your every usage of a normal laptop. This is not for gaming or video rendering, so if you are not expecting that, then this laptop's performance will not disappoint.

The bottom line is you will buy this laptop for its looks, period. There is no value for this laptop - it is targeted as a premium-level laptop, not a value-level laptop. Any other normal laptop with these specs would be about $200 less. So you just have to ask yourself if the burgundy or slate blue color, and the style of design/craftsmanship are worth it for you.",
"I bought this laptop in June of 2019.  This is the 1st generation of the Surface laptop and I got it for a great price because the 2nd generation was rolling out.  My Surface laptop is Cobalt Blue with the Core i7, 8GB RAM, and 256GB hard drive.  Got it for $725.  This was a great price in my mind and why I went with it.  I was looking at some cheaper laptop models (in the $400-$500) range, and wasn't really considering this level of laptop because it is normally in the $1000-$1500 range.  But at $725 I decided to pay a bit extra for the better quality.

One of the most notable differences of moving up to a laptop like this is the design.  It is nice and slim, and looks great.  This was important to me because I wanted something fairly sleek and compact that I could just put in my backpack and go (not a student, but I always have my pack).

The screen is great and I love the 3:2 aspect ratio.

As I'm typing this review, I can tell you that the keyboard is as good as people say it is.  It's got great spacing and the button press is nice and deep for a laptop.  This was big because I'm used to typing on a mechanical keyboard.  The Alcantera surface is a nice touch.  It is a smooth and soft feel and is something that separates it from competition.  Some people have stated that it leaves some oil marks after months of use, but I've mostly seen that in the light grey color.  We'll see what it does having the darker blue color.

The touchscreen works great.  I haven't purchased a Surface pen, but plan to in the future.  The trackpad is also great and gives a nice satisfying click.

The facial recognition for login is accurate and really fast.

I will typically use my Bluetooth earbuds, but I was surprised at how clear and nice the speakers on this sounded.

Overall, this laptop looks and feels like a great laptop and performs very well.  I have had a Macbook Air for my job for the last 2 years, and this is just as good a laptop. In fact, it is probably a bit better because of the little things like a better keyboard and personalized colors.  At the price I got it for, I would definitely recommend this laptop.

Also, I should state that a lot of reviews for this laptop talk about the Windows S operating system being installed on it.  That is no longer the case.  My laptop came pre-loaded with Windows 10 Pro.",
"I thought I was purchasing a new laptop, but it is, in fact, not. There wasn’t anything said in the product description about buying a used machine. This is not my user profile",
"I was advised by the HP customer service representative that this model was running way too slow for a ""New"" model.  Could not load the driver update.  Just gave up after many hours and returned product.  Did not exchange for new model as 1) I thought that was what I had purchased, and 2) did not want to waste another minute of my time trying to get this product to work as represented.",
"I purchased this laptop just for surfing the web, but this small but a multi function laptop is like my fav tool in my home office now. Very light it’sctouchscreen and easy to maneuver. Love it!",
"HOW AND WHY?  I ORDER A FIFTHTEEN INCH, ONLY TO RECD A TWELVE INCH.  OLD PEOPLE  CANNOT DEAL WITH THIS TYPE OF DELIBERATE ATROCITY.  COMPUTER DOES NOT EVEN CHARGE.CANNOT EVEN ACCESS INTERNET .WILL NEVER ORDER AN EXPENSIVE ITEM ON AMAZON AGAIN  CARETAKING FOR MY SISTER WHO JUST DIED, OPEN IT AFTER THE THIRTY  DAY RETURN POLICY.  SAD",
"Okay, so far running well however, if this is a “New” laptop that has been updated why does it have a Knick on the cover?! In addition, when looking at the Warranty, it says that I have 4 months, give or take a few days, left on it. You have to ask yourself that if it’s a New laptop, then why is a 1 year mandatory Warranty left with only 4 months?! The above description is deceiving and should not be allowed. No where on the original description of the product on Amazon does it indicate that it’s a “used” laptop or that it’s a New Lenovo ideapad 3 8Gb with 256 or 512 Gb RAM” that is being updated to 20 Gb with 1Tb”. It states that they are “New”! This needs to be corrected and a clear precise description of what the purchaser is actually buying needs to replace what is currently on Amazon. It so far appears to be a good product and if the company is filling a demand and pricing it accurately, should be honest and forthright about their product unless they have something to hide. I would love a response to the questions posed here as I do not have immediate plans on returning the laptop as long it continues to function as it should. I will continue to update this review to keep customers informed.
Update:
After 10 months of owning this computer, realized the battery does not hold the charge. You can charge it completely one day and a week later, you need to plug it in because it’s threatening to shut off. They added some things and forgot others, like an updated battery or maybe it was done on purpose since we all know that they were not honest enough to inform potential buyers that their computers were technically used.",
increible,
Arrived in great condition and got it up and running quickly. Lenovo has always delivered reliability,
"I bought this laptop a year ago. It is fast and I like the design. However, ever since the day I bought it, there is this somewhat random static noise. Usually it is on start up, but can also happen when opening a program. Usually I can restart the computer and at least the static will stop when I'm in a program. For the amount of money I paid, this should not be happening. I did not return it as I had already bought and installed MS Office and transferred over all of my information.",
"Core i7 was advertised but content is actually an i5.
This is very bad as it cost alot in time and money to return this item",
"I wanted this laptop for work. All i required was to be able to use google chrome with as many tabs open as I need (10+). This laptop cannot handle that. Not only did the browser keep freezing with 4 tabs open, but the whole system was slow. After doing some research I found that the 4gb of ram are not enough to handle Windows 10. Yes the laptop will work, but expect it to freeze and to be very slow.",
"I bought 5 of these for our employees at work. They are incredibly slow to the point of having a loss of production. I had to purchase additional memory (32 GB for each of the computers) and then that wasn't enough to keep the hard drive spinning. When you have been spoiled by SSDs it's really hard to go back to HDDs.  I have since purchased 5 SSD's to replace the antiquated HDD that is currently installed on the laptops. What started out as a deal on some good equipment has turned into a need to upgrade immediately after purchasing and replacing parts that should be a lot more modern and ready to run current OS specs, especially since that's how it was shipped. Very disappointed in the performance.

*****UPDATE*****

I have installed the memory (32 GB) and the SSDs (480 GB). The computers are running much better and are very efficient. They are capable of more and should have been shipped as such. At least we are functional again.",
She’s happy…….I’m happy,
"Super contenta, expectativas Superadas y el envío fue rápido.",
this is a really great laptop I bought for one of our workers. It works well and has a good battery life. It's good value for money.,
"I think Happy Ranger did a great job. The laptop came in excelent condition with the exact same model I ordered.

I wanted a laptop to play videogames and work. With this laptop I could play Cyberpunk in ultra with no lag to give an example of how good it is.

Now I'm going to mention the things I don't like. But this is mostly stuffs with ASUS.

It heats a lot. It can easily go to 90°C very fast. Of course, this laptop have some configurations to speed up / activate the fans which can hold it and I won't go father than that. Also, most games won't have this problem. You can always buy a cooling pad so this isn't big deal.

The battery. Just working as a programmer works around 2-3 hours using linux on balance. Gaming last around 1-2 hours depending on what you are playing. If you use the special configurations on windows it can last a bit more but isn't a big difference.

The screen of the laptop have some weird colors. You can make some configurations but it won't look perfect. My old laptop had a better quality screen. It has a HDMI so you can avoid this problem an use a real monitor.

Despite this little problems, I'm very happy with what I brought.",
It is the same product I ordered and it arrived in perfect condition! I'm really happy with my new laptop!,
"I can only say wonderful, amazing",
Awesome seller and genuine product really loved the 32gb ram,
"This is a great, powerful machine. My word of caution is that its battery life is awful. On battery saving mode with the touchscreen turned off, an hour of light programming depletes a third of the battery. This is likely due to its powerful processor combined with the display. I could see this being a good fit for someone who will primarily use it at a workstation where it’s constantly connected to power, or someone who is usually near an outlet to charge.

Additionally, the computer gets very hot after an hour of use. I would suggest getting a cooling fan or elevating it so the fans on the bottom can circulate a bit more. This is also likely due to the compact case in addition to the powerful processor. This leads me to believe the processor power is not being fully utilized due to the heating issues.

If you already have a bigger machine and are getting this for on-the-go, I would go for the i5 and the base display. The display quality won’t matter on this size and you won’t notice the difference in processor speeds because of the overheating issues I mentioned earlier.

Overall, it’s a beautiful machine and I love the size and weight of it. It feels solid and the display quality is amazing. I can have multiple IDEs open, running a local dev server, tests, and browse the web without worrying about lag. I use it mostly at home on the couch or in bed, with it plugged in so the battery problem sucks but isn’t a dealbreaker. The cooling issue is something I have with my MacBook Pro as well, so a cooling fan has been a good investment regardless.",
"This a laptop was absolutely perfect. The touchscreen was great, really fast, was very comfortable to type, incredible design. This laptop just looked so premium in features and appearance. However, you could feel so much heat coming from the bottom that in half an hour I couldn't bear it upon my legs. And the most important downside was, it had really poor battery performance. It couldn't last more than 3 hours of battery life, even sometimes lasted only 2 and a half hours just using web browsing. No video streaming or any other demanding application. I contacted Dell and they said that this is the battery life time it is supposed to have (which I don't entirely believe, and contradicted what they say in their product website). They changed battery and problem still persisted. At the end they proposed to change both hard disc and motherboard, when in that point, I finally decided to return it to the seller for receiving full refund. It was heartbreaking for me to return it because I loved this laptop. However, this battery issue was unacceptable for me because it completely took any portability off from the laptop. I don't know whether any other laptop of this model has the same issue or I just got unlucky.",
I purchased this laptop as a renewed purchase.  However it did not work for me.  I had to return the laptop because it kept running late.  I was very disappointed.,
My son bought this laptop for school it has been dead we have sent it to dell twice and still not turning on I have been calling and messaging dell for a week now and nothing has been done about it.  Only this i got from them is to call then to renew my warranty its a  total rip off I am not sure how i can recover my  loss i have wasted so much money on this product,
"Product arrived this morning with specs as advertised, and in ""like new"" condition; original exterior box and accessories, although with new interior packing materials. Comes with a ""Dell Outlet"" sticker on the bottom. Windows 10 setup and Dell SupportAssistant setup same as for a new machine. 1TB NVME SSD on my machine is a WD SN730; CrystalDiskMark screen shot attached. So far, so good!",
This laptop is the best I every have had the pleasure of using. High spec (for me at least) with a gorgeous monitor. The screen is quite small at 13 inches so I back up the laptop with a 42 inch UHD/4K TV. Brilliant!,
"Great PC for work and play. I use it as my main travel PC for videos and music production as we as games when I have some free time. I purchased it because you get a 12th gen i7 plus ddr5 memory, a built-in graphics card, and thunderbolt 4. I am very happy with my purchase. Oh, yea I almost forgot ASUS is giving me a 90-warranty extension just for telling about my purchase! Wow! Another reason to buy.",
"Performs well, I use it for 3D architectural software with raytracing",
"Broke my last laptop (different brand) when I tossed my backpack in the back of a truck. The plastic body was dented and shorted the motherboard.  New laptop is great, metal exterior but pretty light.",
We love that’s working smooth Good price,
"This is a great build for the price, i would recommend a memory upgrade to 64gig.. it barely touches 6 cores of the 16 on VR based games..data entry programming this laptop is a monster..!",
"Runs smoothly with no issues, I'm really happy with this laptop.
If I remember I'll update this review later in case something comes up.",
Really sad. This is perfect but I looked everywhere for a touch screen and the description says TOUCHSCREEN yet there is none. I was a bit disappointed because my old asus had a touch screen and i used the screen more than I used the touch pad :/ might hook up my old laptop screen instead and use that as a second screen!,
Ordered 2. Both shut down randomly. Freeze randomly. Restart randomly. Multiple times a day. Crap product. Will be returning.,
this is the third computer that I purchase with deffects.  Will not buy from amazon again. This is not a cheap purchase and now we have to take the time to return it. It is not worth it.,
"SHAME AMAZON!!! They sent the laptop broke after three days, returned the shipment back Amazon can pay the cost of returning by mail from Guam, the lost $ 143 was NOT RETURNED AND REFUSED TO RETURN!  SHAME AMAZON!!!",
"I bought this for an online class and right after first class, webcam stopped working! Asus support tried to no avail to troubleshoot but never came back up. I was already liking this product but this event casts a doubt about the reliability of this product.",
"The laptop stopped connecting to the Internet, there was no WLAN driver for it many people said that the Network chip is defective for this laptop. I have been dealing with this issue since I got the Laptop.",
"I love Asus, the durability, quality, specs and affordability. But unfortunately this one had an issue with the screen, it used to flicker and turn off for a second and turn back on. Talked to Asus support and they said it's a hardware issue and must be returned, so i did a few days ago and waiting for my refund.",
"This was sent to me in an undamaged outer box, with the actual product box inside completely destroyed. It has a ""warehouse certified"" sticker on it, as if someone deemed this fit for use. The destroyed box was also taped together, confirming this was intentionally shipped in this condition. The screen is shattered and the laptop itself is completely bent from top to bottom. It looks like it was run over. Unacceptable and intentional disappointment.",
"The laptop is good for gaming and everything! Only issue is that the screen kept on flickering even after warranty repairs its still flickering im not sure what the issue is.

Update, now the wifi suddenly drops and seem to be a faulty driver. They said the bad screen is very rare and i guess i was the lucky one to get it. But now a bad network driver? Make sure you check for everything from the build quality and the drivers before purchasing.",
"Entrega super rápida, excelente producto",
"I've had non stop issues with this computer since day 1. I've been completely unable to game on it due to it constantly freezing & overheating.

There's an issue somewhere utilizing all of the RAM. I've attempted to contact ASUS multiple times for support & have gotten no where.

Do yourself a favor & go with a different brand.",
"Got a defective unit which would sometimes not power on.  Sent back to ASUS before warranty expires and said that I had to pay $1000+ to fix the defect, upon sending it for repair the 2nd time, came back with same issue.  Choose a brand with better warranty and customer support.  Skip asus.  They could not even repair their own unit.",
Great for gaming if left plugged in,
Playing FIFA22 right since yesterday. No a single glitch. I am extremely happy with it.,
Very nice. I got what I expected,
"Ordered 3 for holiday gifts. First one, then another, now all 3 shut down randomly. Freeze randomly. Restart randomly. Multiple times a day. First one to start crashing is now completely dead. Returning all 3 to ASUS.

PS.  Bogus reviews on this product as well as the GeForce 30 series cards didn't start shipping until 2021, so unsure where all those 2019 product reviews are coming from.",
"Excellent gaming laptop, playing all games on ultra settings, even the latest titles play without issues.",
"Fast, Reliable, and Affordable. Easy to set up, plug and play.",
"Purchased for son, he had chosen himself. Maybe he should choose 2TB drive, due to heavy modern 3-d graphics games, hope he will not need to make the upgrade the disk soon.",
"I PURCHASE THIS LAPTOP IN MAY, NOV IT DO NOT WORK. NEVER DROPPED IT NO WATER DAMAGE, IT JUST BURNT OUT, IT OVER HEATS AND BLOWS OUT STEAMING HOT AIR. I AM NOT GOING TO LIE, WHEN I FIRST PURCHASED IT, I LOVE IT ALTHOUGHT IT BLEW OUT HOT AIR ON MY HAND FROM THE SIDE OF THE PC. THEN CERTAIN  PLACES WHERE I LOGGED ON AT, SOME OF THE WRITTING WAS HARD TO SEE. IT RAN GOOD BUT BLEW HOT AIR FOR 5 IN A HALF MONTHS THEN IT DIED, I HATE I PAID SO MUCH MONEY FOR THIS PC AND IT DO NOT WORK, I WANT MY MONEY BACK. 1400 FOR A DEAD PC WOW",
"Not touch screen but didn’t want that, nice screen, great specs, and easy to upgrade which I like, so far so good",
"Bought this for my husband, & he loves it! Fast computer, great for gaming! All around very happy & great quality.",
"ASUS knows that this wireless card is garbage. It often requires replacement. I'm out of warranty by a week, and ASUS is like ""Too bad, so sad."" But this is a constant problem with their TUF laptops. They don't care. They sell garbage because they know it'll last at least a year, and then its not their problem any more.",
This laptop is a beast yet lightweight.  It does get hot but only when playing games that require additional graphics power.  Have played COD Warzone and Warcraft without issues.,
"Runs Valheim like a dream. And I have some elaborate builds. I still get 60 FPS.
Also runs Monster Hunter World and Monster Hunter Rise without any slow downs.
Total War War Hammer II with massive armies runs clean.",
"Screen works fine initially, but eventually (it was apparently the disney plus app that did it to me) flickers and dies. then it goes off and on and off and on just conitually more glitchy. Sure it comes back to a usable state, but for $1,500 dollars I shouldn't have had that issue at all with this computer.
in addition, the frame around the screen is narrow and seems like it would not be very protective. be very careful not to flex or break that or you'll easily damage your screen if it doesn't glitch first. I was super disapointed, I really loved this computer otherwise, but a glitchy screen isn't worth the money even with so much gaming power behind it.

Also this thing runs WAAAY hot. like 175 degrees Fahrenheit hot and it only stays below that on 'silent' mode so there's no point to running it in turbo cuz youd melt the keyboard. I could have probably cooked an egg on this thing's vents.  again, a shame cuz its otherswise got great specs. but not worth it.",
First of all build is ok screen is more loose and flimsy than i like so returning. I want a laptop that will last for many years.,
Complete junk. Nice paper weight thought. Seller is completely useless as well.,
"There is a known problem with the cheap Meditek wi-fi cards they installed on these.  After spending dozens of hours on forums reading about 100's of people with the same problem, it's not clear if it's just janky hardware, or Asus just can't get the BIOS to work properly with the card.  Every time windows updates, be prepared for endless wi-fi problems which will eventually be fixed by a BIOS update from Asus.  Asus refuses to acknowledge the problem, and will not send you a replacement card.  Their customer service completely stonewalled me, and pretended they had never heard of the problem before, even though it's been going on for over a year now.  The only real fix seems to be to just get an intel ax200 replacement.  They're around $30.  Obviously not a huge expense, but ALOT of time wasted with Asus customer service getting no result, then hours spent on the forums trying to solve it myself.  Won't buy an Asus again.",
"The same day we opened this laptop the unit began to shut off. This was a gift to my son who didn't make me aware of the problem until AFTER the Amazon return date. I sent the unit into ASUS and they charged me $130 for a repair. Once we received it back,  the problem still persisted. They did not offer a refund for the charge.

Dealing with ASUS has been a nightmare and as of today,  months and months later, the unit STILL shuts off randomly and glitches the screen out. My son was so excited to start gaming and has not been able to due to this defective device. Extremely disappointed and out of $1700+ dollars.",
"Honestly, I want to love this laptop, but their BIOS update has completely tanked the Wifi. I've tried every solution, and the only thing left would be to return this laptop, but then I'd need to update the BIOS. So, really it's busted.",
"Broken wifi 2 mts in needed to buy wifi attachments, some keys stopped working using external keyboard. Now just a desktop. Oh runs hot, need to buy a cooling mat too.",
"I purchased this Asus TUF Dash 15 from the ""Lucky Tech, LLC"" Amazon store. I have had issues for the last month with the machine crashing/locking up sporadically with increasing frequency. I thought it might be a bad video display driver. So, I made sure everything was up-to-date but the problem persisted. I did a few system restores, some from the local Windows copy and some from the cloud.  I spent a lot of time trying to isolate what the problem might be. While this was going on, I noticed disk errors starting to show up in the System event logs. At this point, I really thought it is a hardware issue. I reached out to Asus for support and they sent me a link to create an RMA. However, when I tried to create an RMA, it said I needed to go to Best Buy. I went to Best Buy and, even though I am a Total Care member, they would not honor the warranty because I did not buy the laptop there.  I reached out to ""Lucky Tech, LLC"" about this and they directed me back to Best Buy, even though I clearly told them in writing on multiple occasions that ""Best Buy would not honor the warranty because I did not buy the laptop."" The only thing that makes sense is that they are reselling laptops they buy from Best Buy and the warranty is not transferrable.

Bottom line, I am the proud owner of a $1700 boat anchor. This is really impacting my business. I would not do business with this seller.",
"Package came in good condition, IPS Screen have a good black color, RGB keyboard can control color and brightness, runs fast, it comes with two RAM of 8 GB (total 16) and you can change to two RAM of 16 GB (total 32) but check the warranty conditions before,  maybe you should change the memory in the store. I played battlefield 5 for a hour and the heat was not extremely and the noise of fans was tolerantly, if you will play for a long time you should buy in addition external fans.",
"Worth every penny. I'm actually writing the review on this laptop (physically using) 8 months later! So needless to say I have broken it in. Full disclosure, I modded this right out of the box. I added in an additional M.2 for another 2TB of space and upgraded to 64GB (2x32) of RAM. The SSD and RAM ran me about $250 (USD) and it was breeze to install. The laptop runs great, no cooling issues, no frame drops or lag. I cannot speak to the battery life because this lives on the desk next to my workstation and I have not traveled with it. But lets be honest, no one games aggressively at the coffee shop. If you are playing an intense, power demanding game you are likely sitting at home. If you don't want the bulk of a PC tower and you want to sit anywhere in the house on your computer than this is the best there is for you. The cherry on top is that this is from ASUS and in over 10 years of using their products I have nothing but great things to say about the company and what they produce.",
"I previously posted about receiving this computer as a refurbished product. I am removing that post because Ted and all the folks at the seller recognized the mistake right away and jumped through hoops to get me the new product I ordered within 24 hours. I cannot say enough good things about folks who recognize a problem and offer real solutions, and then follow through on those solutions.

The computer? Fast, well built, great screen
 It runs hot, of course, so get a quality laptop cooler.",
"This is the second ASUS machine I have tried to use.  The first machine was returned due to a problem with the WIFI being totally inoperable.  I fought with that machine for about a week before returning it.
As I really like the first machine overall, I decided to give the ASUS TUF series another try and went with a bit of an upgrade from the first machine.
Initial start up and Windows 10 set up went flawless and easy.  Wifi connected quick easy and fast.  From my first experience I was able to go through and do a lot of basic setup with the ASUS utilities and basic Windows preferences.
Everything worked fine until the first BIOS update to version 309 installed.  After that the wifi became quite erratic.  It might or might not connect.  When it doesn't connect, the wifi won't display any networks at all.  In some cases the hardware will shut down and there won't even be a WiFi option.
Pros
It is a big screen and decent keyboard.  Backlighting is somewhat programmable for overall color and there are apparently some basic special effects that can be turned on with the ASUS Armory Crate utility.  In this instance the machine came with 16G of memory, 6G of graphics memory and a 1T SSD.  I never really got to try out the gaming or usability of the machine as the WiFi not working is a deal breaker.

Cons
The NUM LOCK key has no visual light or marker to indicate if it is on or off.  A small LED like the Caps Lock would have been fine, but it has none so you have to find out the hard way.
Once all the basic Windows 10 stuff is set up from original install/set up the machine runs quite well and was a lot faster than the first machine I had.  When Windows 10 starts doing the upgrades/updates, DO NOT ALLOW THE BIOS UPDATES!!!!!!!!!!!  The WiFi problems are due to faulty bios starting with versions 309.  Versions 310 and 312 completely shut down the ability for the wifi to work at all.  If you don't have a Cat5 cable to plug in for internet, you will be out of luck.

Heat.  This is a powerful machine and the processors generate a lot of heat.  There should have been some kind of built in stand offs on the underside to give more air space under the fans.  As it is designed it sets too close to a smooth flat table for enough air to flow.  It really needs a laptop cooler if you plan on doing any real gaming.  If it has about 3/4 of an inch under the machine at the top end, it seems to stay fairly cool if you have the fans running at all.  (I actually can't hear them myself)

I will probably be returning this to Amazon.  I would not recommend ANY of the ASUS computers at this time due to the BIOS WiFi issue.  For me, the lack of WiFi access makes this a boat anchor.  Of course ASUS isn't really saying anything about this ocean liner slamming into an iceberg.
Be aware that there are a lot of ""make do"" fixes online for the ASUS WiFi issue.  I suspect it is going to be worse before it is better.
The first machine started having problems the first evening.  Through the following week the WiFi became more and more erratic until it just wouldn't work at all.
At this point THIS macnine is ONE DAY OLD and the wifi is completely shut down.",
"This thing is amazing. Large (as I knew when purchasing a 17” screen) but very portable, extremely tough chassis. Fastest piece of equipment I’ve had my hands on in a hot minute. Beautifully simple to install extra hardware. 9/10 I’d buy it again, although a couple of their competitors look like fun too and variety is the spice of life, right? Can’t say if it’s the laptop for you, but it is the laptop for me!

Seriously happy with this purchase.

P.S.  I also opted for the 1TB SSD and i7-11800H configuration with a GeForce RTX 3060…price was right at the time so I spoiled myself lol",
This product has changed my life. I can do so many things with it from video editing to music production. the only negative is that The battery life goes really quick. I have everything in low power mode and still it is dying super fast. Great computer to stay at home with but if you are constantly on the go then this battery life is not for you!,
"This laptop is FAST. I have a dual XEON server for editing video but am finding myself doing more and more work on this laptop. Because It’s also very fast at editing video.

It has a great feature that automatically switches between the default Intel GPU (energy/battery saving) for everyday tasks and switches to using the discrete NVIDIA RTX3060 (performance) in games and heavy video editing.  You can manually specify in the NVIDIA Experience app to run specific games ONLY using the NVIDIA GPU because sometimes it will try to use the slower default GPU. For most windows tasks the Intel GPU is great.

 It does run hot, so I would recommend a laptop cooler if you going to play demanding games. The fans do a great job at pumping the heat outside the laptop. However, It must have plenty of ventilation underneath to allow proper airflow. Extremely warm air is ejected from three places (left side rear, right side rear and right side.

The fans (x2) when in silent mode are just that … silent. However in turbo mode they are very loud. Not a big deal for me because I use noise canceling headphones that totally eliminate the fan noise.

I upgraded the RAM in this laptop soon after purchase from 16GB (2x8GB) to 32GB (2x16GB). This is the kit I purchased and confirm that they run at full 3200MHz speeds with timings of CL 20 RCD 22 RP 22 RAS 42 on a JDEC profile.

Hope this helps.",
Don’t order from this vendor,
"My webcam worked fine, but it was just turned off in the BIOS.  Great purchase!",
"We are retired and RV the country.  Needed a laptop to stay in touch and pay bills.  For the money,... this is a great little computer.",
"Condition was as described, working well so far",
Computer will not charge above 54 percent. It is supposedly refurbished.,
"I got this laptop because i needed a new one to replace my absolute doodie ass computer and so far its been working great. Im able to have mods and multiple games without it imploding on itself. Totally recommend for people who just need a casual school laptop or a laptop to play games on.

(for reference i got the 1tb 16 gb ram)",
"It has so many problems, I just sent it back.",
Sent a refurbished chrome book in silver when I ordered a brand new rose gold laptop. Returns immediately. Will not buy again.,
I’ve had nothing but trouble with this item. Do not recommend.,
Bought this to use with my cricut since my Cromebook wouldn’t work with application. Took forever to get out of S mode. Wished it was not windows 11 but making it work.,
Bought this as I was in need of a personal and business computer. I was lucky to find this on sale for President's Day which carved $250 off the regular price. I will say it is worth every penny it is for sale for even not on sale today...,
"I expected it to be somewhat slow being refurbished; it’s too slow. Takes forever to load anything, restarting it is a nightmare, and an update took over an hour. Really disappointed.",
It's just good for me u don't do much but play games and pay bills on my laptop,
"I purchased this because my work laptop is an HP and is fantastic which is why I purchased this.  I guess you get what you pay for.  This is the SLOWEST laptop.  I cannot get anything done - i.e. check my emails, pay bills.  Its just way too slow.  When I first received it, it seemed fine up until I installed Windows 11.  Ever since then its been downhill.  I am now searching for a replacement.",
"Packaged very well in time FED EX delivery. Easy start up. Exactly what was stated in description is what I recieved.
Would buy again from this dealer.",
The lab top is super fast. Works just has good as my Mac Book. A lot cheaper though,
"Although I didn't buy this from Amazon, this is the laptop my work has provided me and I love it so much I'm starting to save up to buy my own & figured I'd add my review in the meantime. In the last five years of my career, this truly has been the best laptop I have used. It's fast, it's got a beautiful image resolution, it's lightweight, and there hasn't been a single issue with it in the last two years. Even being a Apple/IOS over-consumer, I prefer using this laptop over my personal mac computer because the software doesn't get outdated as fast, the camera is better, it's overall clearer, brighter and more sleek in my opinion.

The laptop keyboard includes buttons to easily lock the camera off so I don't have to worry about accidentally turning my camera on in a meeting when I'm still in my pjs. For similar reasons, I also like that there's a mute button on the keyboard as well as volume & brightness keys. My millennial brain still needs the satisfaction of a clicking-key keyboard and I'm able to use my usb/bluetooth paired keyboard & mouse without issues.

The price is not ideal but like I said, I'm saving up to buy one for my own personal use because I can't recommend this laptop enough!",
I believe that stated chipset has 8 cores instead of the stated 2.,
"Really nice laptop, dimensions and specs are great.  I purchased the laptop May 4th, end of Oct I'm shipping it off for the second time to get repaired.  At about 3 months old I had to ship it back to be fixed (and cover a hefty shipping fee) because the lightning port stopped working, so couldnt use my docking station.  It took around 3 weeks to get the fixed laptop back.  Now I'm getting ready to ship it off for the second time, will cover another $70 shipping fee and hopefully take less that 3 weeks this time to get back.  I purchased the laptop May 4th, end of Oct I'm shipping it off for the second time to get repaired",
"Positive:
Touchscreen and pad works perfectly
Keyboard and speaker and camera works well
Small and modern and super stylish
If it’s only been a bit newer condition, I’d probably keep it.
But I’ve bought another Dell latitude and it came super mint condition. I only needed it for work sometimes, really, so I was not looking for anything fancy like the XPS.

Negative:
I got the XPS since description says Grade A and I really wanted to keep it.
But here’s the minor issues:
there’s several scratches around the laptop. It’s also not very well cleaned. (See photos) Since it’s metallic covering, you can feel the dents like a sore thumb. The charger showed well-used and actual bent as seen on one of the pictures.  The charging port/opening has a lot of scratches (photos). I think the sd slot will not work since it’s full of dust (photo).
While using this for a little bit, it got hot and noticed the battery is draining faster than normal. It also gotten hotter while charging on the back portion; battery area. The fan is also not very quite. Camera is from bottom up; like facing your nose from the bottom.
I really wanted to keep the XPS even tho it’s $100 something more than the latitude because of its modern and stylish look but I also wanted to have something durable for remote work few days a week which latitude are known for. So sadly I have to return this one. Someday maybe if I have to buy a new one, I’d probably buy this model.",
Excellent,
Love my new laptop,
The best Laptop,
Dells are always decent.,
Awesome product thank you,
so far my Dell laptop working excellent,
"Not a good product. After few months, Google started to stop working repeatedly and I need to reload.",
Works very well.  No problems!,
Extremely satisfied with this Dell Laptop. Perfect size. No issues. Running Great.,
"The laptop would not give me anything better than 45Mbps while my phone and another laptop were consistently better than 170 Mbps. Called Dell, spoke to the warranty person. They remoted into my laptop, couldn't fix it but thought it was strange. Connected me to the Dell technician who reminded me I did not take out an extended service warranty and they would assist with technical assistance but only if I pay $200. Spoke to Amazon, got a replacement, same result so it was not a one-off bad wireless card. Returned the replacement got refund. Also, this laptop never recognized my 5G connection either. If slow connection is OK go for this laptop, I have no patience for slow connection when I have high speed wireless.",
Had to disable 10S for 3rd party applications.,
Good for the price,
"It looks new, runs great and the touch screen feature is amazing!",
Sorry I had to return this item did not us,
Sound is an opportunity,
"We bought this and everything works fine, but there is NO DVD player as described and pictured, which is why we picked this specific laptop.",
I LOVE this laptop. Works perfectly and a great price!,
"I previously owed an Inspiron 15 and had it for five years when children advised updating to a new one.  Not wild about a touchscreen or ""Edge"" taking over the screen but it is an excellent laptop.  Would recommend for any use!",
"this computer so far is well worth the cost. very fast.  easy to set up. cortana guides you all the way. some of the keys are a bit small but I guess that's the new thing. windows 10 is not all that difficult,  I had 7 before and everything went well. don't pay someone to set it up. this is the first computer I have set up without help. 8gb ram and 256gb storage is more than plenty. good buy so far. I didn't rate gaming because I am not into that. so far so good.",
The product description is a bit confusing but this is the Mediatek 828 version of this Chromebook.  It has an eight-core ARM processor and it came out in mid 2022. It has speakers on the top of the keyboard and is a steal at this price.  In practice the battery life is not 15 hours if you use video but it is still quite good.,
"Navy vet who is going to grad school at UNLV here. I absolutely LOVE the 8th gen Intel XPS laptop/notebook. The laptop might look small but it packs quite a punch. It comes with an 8th gen intel core I5 processor, 8 GB of ram and 128 gigs. It is very light weight and that is good because carrying that around campus in the summers, when it is over 110 degrees can be challenging. If you fly all the time you will appreciate this laptop because it is easy to carry. I love the infinity edge, the retna display on the camera and the battery life. What I don't love is the keyboard, it is a bit mushy and with Dell, upgrades are expensive like apple. I was going to get it from amazon but Dell offered a lower price, with my military discount. I was able to get this when it came out for $900 out the door. I highly recommend this notebook I am not a play video games on my laptop guy but you can use it for that, of course there are better laptops if that is what you want. This is perfect for the student or businessperson who wants a professional looking laptop. I also picked the silver color because it looks nice. People often mistake this laptop for a macbook pro but it's a Dell.",
Good,
As described.,
I love it. Thank you.,
I have had this computer and been using it strictly for work email purposes and it literally died today. Cannot open my programs or get into email or anything. I wish there was a way to click negative stars.,
"Great speed, memory and graphics in a small package. Lightweight with great battery life. Extremely impressed",
For the price range is amazing and little to complain about. Im using it for my university and everyday laptop.,
"Really poor support, if any at all. Dell can’t find that I purchased this and thus refuses to support. Battery dies after a couple of day even when system is shutdown. This result in crashed hard drive and failure of PC. Don’t do it!!!",
"Just received this item. Perfectly lightweight. The sound is actually quite good.
It runs quite hot so not very suitable for lap use.",
"It’s pretty good. It has a slight light bleed in one of the corners, but it’s not a big deal, it’s pretty small.",
"this is a five star product. I don't know what else I can say. if you have doubts buying it, well you shouldn't.",
"I purchased this laptop less than 9 months ago and the screen already died. When I power up the laptop the screen is just blank. I tried all types of troubleshooting, but nothing worked. Luckily it’s still under warranty so Dell is fixing for free, but I have to wait 2 to 3 weeks, in which I won’t be able to work. Very disappointed with the quality of this laptop.",
excellent product,
I ended up putting a 512 Samsung m.2 hard drive in. This laptop is perfect for me. I go to school full time and it handles Java programming and big pdfs of textbooks really well.,
"It is good ,I think it is a good choice for wowan,it is light.",
"It's sick, I never thought I would buy one of these (although not as bad as buying an Apple)...but I'm glad I did! The keyboard is a bit mushy but whatever. It's got the ""evilcorp-E"" on its 45-degree angle, which is awesome. I use mine to connect to an AWS Lightsail instance, so probably a Chromebook would have sufficed, but yeah, well, whatever.",
"This laptop replaced my older (identical) unit that had a bulging battery, and the new unit arrived, but would not power up.  After a maddening 1+ hour call to Dell tech support, I got tired of being shuffled between people that were of zero help, and I had  such a difficult time of understanding what they were saying.  The language barrier is definitely a problem with tech help that is 12,000 miles away.  I then called Amazon and got a replacement, which works just fine.  Thank you Amazon.",
"My complain is not with the product, as much as it is with the seller. Bought laptop back in May 2019. When I got it there was a small bend in the corner of the laptop, not a big deal so I taught. As time when by the bend started effecting the housing where the keyboard is , and started to open up the casing (as shown in the pictures). Called Dell for repairs under warranty. AND TO MY SURPRISE THE WARRANTY HAD EXPIRED ON JAN 2019  2MONTHS BEFORE  I PURCHASED THE PRODUCT. Dell told me the laptop was in operation since Jan 2018. I never told it was  a used laptop or refurbished.",
"no flex to the case, extremely fast, has a PCIe SSD (NOT NVMe) screen quality is perfect, battery life averages 11 hours with very light usage, like 7 with heavy loads. Most impressive is this thing came with NO bloatware at all, none. After booting the only thing on the desktop was the recycle bin. Awesome laptop is you need quick performance and really long battery life.",
"Got one when it first hit Amazon around 2 months ago. Terrific deal and it indeed does include a HD touchscreen. The SSD is a bit small but I always upgrade the SSDs anyway on these laptops to the fastest ones on the market. Mine was shipped in two days with free shipping to Hawaii. So far no problems with it and it indeed is brand new with a 14-month warrantee from Dell.

Beware as a lot of deals on Ebay are actually refurbs for around the same price. Also a lot of the sales and promos direct from Dell you need to check the fine print as many of the 8th Gen XPS laptops do not include a touchscreen.

That being said, due to the small 13"" screen size for best use of the touchscreen you need a stylus not unless you have real small fingers. In the same vein, getting the QHD screen in touchscreen is a waste of time and not worth the extra bucks.

Update: Downgraded to 3 stars because I finally got around to running CrystalMark 6.0 on this machine, only to find out that at 500/500 R/W speeds, the vendor installed a SATA III drive, not an NVME PCIE drive, which comes pretty much standard on computers sold in 2018. The ad here on Amazon is carefully worded to state only ""SSD"", with no indication it is the faster and more commonly used NVME drives, that is why I am giving it 3 stars for deception. I am currently in the process of upgrading to a 1 TB NVME PCIE drive, which I got for $270 (they normally run close to $400 but prices are continuing to drop).",
"+++ :
1) Cheap value for such premium product (650 $)
2) Battery life is very good considering i5 8th gen model with 8gb ram
3) Legacy port still there (2 usb A, 1 thunderbolt), compared with the newer version (only thunderbolt)

--- :
1) SSD not so fast,",
"Love the product, gets a little warm.  Would personally like it better if it had a CD slot.",
"This laptop is for travel, up to 15 days a month. I have only had it for about a week, so durability will have to be updated later.

The most important thing to note and the item that caused me the most consternation -- the ability, or lack of ability to charge via USB-C.

This laptop WILL charge via USB-C, despite the warning on screen that you are not using a Dell charger!

I did NOT want a laptop that needed the traditional plug, cord, brick, cord, proprietary barrel tip set up to charge. Happy to report that the charger by Vheonet sold on Amazon works well to charge the XPS 13 9360: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07K1ZVBFH/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

Other than that, I love the screen, the keyboard, the size, weight and overall feel of the device. This is the 2nd XPS 13 we have had in the house and the 5th Dell computer. Hoping is holds up as well as all the others.",
"EDIT: 1 star. Received ""blue screen"" error twice now. Dell customer service is pathetic, no help at all. Returning ASAP.

First impressions upon opening and setting up: INCREDIBLY underwhelming. Sure, the screen is nice and sharp. But it runs extremely loud, and the fan is constantly blowing while doing simple things like writing e-mails or browsing the web. My previous Acer laptop was half the price and had an i3 processor, but ran leaps and bounds quieter, and just as ""snappy"" when browsing or running apps. Also certain keys on the keyboard are not very responsive. The period key (""."") seems to be particularly bad, and I keep missing it when trying to navigate web pages. Very frustrating. This is likely going to be returned. I don't see what all the hype is about.",
"Fast computer. Can’t tell if there is a defect or not... sometimes the fan is so loud! Sounds like rattling on the inside

UPDATE: The orange light below the space bar blinks constantly, and the laptop does not even turn on or remain on unless it is connected to the power supply.  Something already needs replacing.",
"I had no idea how small 13 inches were but its pretty compact! I hate windows 10 though so I spent a good hour or two uninstalling bloatware and enabling admin controls etc... The dell xps 9360 was THE choice because of the longest battery life compared to the 9370 and the current 9380. Plus with the 8th gen i5 it's a smash!

All I use with this ultrabook is for programming and classic games such as Everquest and Quakeworld etc... They run perfectly fine and I'm happy! The only thing I need to do is swap out this small 128gb ssd for 512 and boom it's my all!",
At this price point this laptop is a great value. Computer is fast and snappy with almost no lag doing routine tasks and opening basic programs. Very satisfied with this purchase.,
"Lightweight thin and easy to carry.
Good screen resolution.
Works fast.
Thanks",
Great laptop with 10 key,
"Just got it today so I will update my review accordingly.
First off, the mouse pad is a single unit (the picture in the description shows it as a mouse pad and 2 separate buttons for left and right clicking) it is not as pictured which erks me since I've had trouble with a single unit mousepad in the past so we will see.
NO BACKLIT KEYBOARD
apparently not a pavilion!
Dude hp get your stuff together and make the item description true to your word.",
"This laptop has only two USB ports, I've had it for only a month and one of them has fallen apart internally.",
NO BACK LIGHT KEYBOARD AS ADVERTISED IN DESCRIPTION,
"The computer is incorrectly advertised as having a back-lit keyboard. It does not have a back-lit keyboard. I had to return it due to this. If it wasn't for that, the computer was really nice. I hated to return it but I work in the dark so must have a backlit keyboard.",
Disappointed sine it supposed to have backlit keyboard which it does not,
"I read a lot of reviews saying this didn't have a back lit keyboard,  but it in fact does. There is a button on your keyboard that turns it on, dims it and turns it off. It's the f5 button. Runs smoothly,  fast and sleek looking. So far I love it",
"Only had it since yesterday. Seems to be a decent laptop, however, I chose this one for the backlit keyboard and it doesn't have one. This is a 4th computer in the household to be used in my room mainly at night, so that feature was important to me. Also, as another reviewer posted, I was told I would have to sign for it. At least she got a doorbell ring. Mine was left on the side of the house ~ not even a ring. Good thing I was home and tracked it right to the house.",
"This is one of the worst computers I have ever owned so not waste your money. It crashes just using word, and is basically incapable of running higher functions.",
Perfect for gaming!!,
"Received computer. No damage at all. But constantly
Had problems. Call tech support they stated bad windows operating system. Waited two weeks got new worked fine for about a month and now problems again. Now cannot get any connection for internet.  This computer has been nothing but problems. Evidently was not checked out before sending",
This laptop is fast compare to any other pc Ive use. It can handle every task while multitasking. The only thing I didn’t like about the laptop is that when I bought it there was only 1 left @ $879 after I purchased it it when down to $700 and 3 where available. Now there’s none!!!,
"Wow , this Hp laptop is truly amazing and the solid state drive is super fast. Flawless setup, more memory has done the trick to make this a joy to use.  I tried to bog it down but it barely uses the resources.  My old HP with only 16gb memory would take forever on high resource tasks.  Glad I made the investment into a big hard drive and memory.  Looking forward to at least 5 years of trouble free HP performance.",
"This is not a system as the image shown, but merely a compute element.",
"This is ONLY THE BRAIN OF THE MACHINE, NO CASE, NO POWER SUPPLY, JUST THE ""MOTHER BOARD"".",
My bad. A 14 inca screen is a bit small for my use.,
"So far so good!  I've heard of iBuyPower but never researched them as I usually build my own computers.  But the price of parts put the rig I wanted out of my budget this time 'round.  As I researched box rigs, the iBuyPower name popped up several times,

I finally found the Tracer MR at BestBuy of all places and I couldn't believe the set up for the price!  Reviews good, price good, build good - so I pulled the trigger.  Setup was pretty easy and this thing is QUIET for all the fans it's running.

At this point my only complaint is the RGB synching software.  The version that shipped caused antivirus to block and stop it.  I downloaded the latest version and only have control of the external fans and RAM.  All in all though, I don't care much about RGB and will most likely just shut it all off.

This is a very solidly built rig.  Packed right, decent setup instructions, and it fired right up.  I am a fan and have high hopes for th next couple years!",
"Awesome product, excellent prices!!! Ordered around the holiday and they delivered a lot faster than I was expecting! I would recommend this company to everyone!",
"I ordered it black Friday wasn't prime so was gonna take a while. It delivered within 5 days. Delivery said it would be mid December, arrived a week after Thanksgiving! Haven't had any problems, fans run low volume and have no complaints. Although if you do run large games I would recommend to get a separate hard drive as there is not a huge storage space. For this being my first actual gaming pc I would def recommend!!",
"Track pad stopped working after only six months of non-daily use.

I bought this as my carry-around computer because it is small & light. Wanted to have the minimum amount of accessories. Unfortunately, since the trackpad died, I'm going to have to get a mouse.

Also, the fingerprint ID feature is really unreliable. If it doesn't work the first time, forget additional attempts, they don't work either. Then, instead of asking for your PASSWORD, the notebook asks you for your PIN. You aren't given the option of password or pin. IOW the security features on this device are a hassle. The touch ID is unreliable & the lack of options on answering an alternate security feature that you have actually memorized kind of blow with a computer that is your primary carry-around device. If I'm taking the computer out of the house, I want security features enabled. I want them to work like they are supposed to & not obstruct ME, the owner, from getting onto the device.",
"Returning this piece of junk after less than an hour out of the box. It looked shiny and new, but Amazon's refurbishment ""experts"" clearly have no expertise whatsoever. The PC was running incredibly slowly (far worse than the one I was trying to replace, which is suuuuper old), froze every time I tried to download software (all I attempted was Firefox and AVG Antivirus, I didn't get any farther than that). I had to do a hard shutdown with the power button after each download in order to access the installation file in my ""downloads"" folder because of the system freeze, and then the machine would freeze again if I tried to run the installation - these little installation wizards normally fire right up and take all of two minutes to complete. When I tried aborting the frozen process via the task manager, the PC would go totally blank (screen turns white, nothing on it, and again have no option but to shut down with the power button and then try again). I did six hard shutdowns in half an hour, trying to install the most basic functionality software. The 10 year old refurbed Lenovo I bought in a parking lot from a guy on Craigslist a year and a half ago works vastly better. The power cable that came with this machine (which, by the way, is super short, which might be an issue for a lot of people even buying the same computer new from the manufacturer) was in a crumpled mess in the box, so it doesn't seem like they're really trying to even create the appearance of professionalism. All Amazon's ""renewal"" program did was tie up $650 of my money for a while (I'll get the refund sometime after they receive the returned machine, supposedly...). I definitely won't be buying any product that Amazon is involved in making or refurbishing again, and when I get my money back, I'll just buy a brand new machine with less impressive specs for the same price - discounted pricing for better specs is useless if the machine doesn't actually work.",
Received as open box and works fine screen has marks on it from previous user and there is a dent in the tip casing,
"I love this laptop! Works perfectly for anything I've had to do so far, included using my CAC Reader (didn't work on my old laptop). And it's so pretty!

Will update review later after I start class and start using it more heavily",
"Simple tablet, basic quality, works well for what it is. Would buy again for the right price",
Stopped working after 1 day so disappointed,
Very nice quality. I gave this poster as a gift.,
I hated the fact that the site said it was in working order and I couldn't even type in my wifi password. Seriously never buying a renewed or refurbished item again. Oh and I honestly just wanted to read and scroll with it.,
It was nice I just thought a tablet was something else and it wasn't right for my phone connections it was nice it wasn't what I needed,
Loved the HP ENVY 17t 17.3.,
"I recently got myself this tablet and I must say, it has exceeded all my expectations! The sleek design and vibrant display make it a pleasure to use. The processing power is impressive, allowing for smooth multitasking and lag-free performance. The battery life is phenomenal, lasting me through long hours of use without needing a charge. The user interface is intuitive and easy to navigate, making it perfect for both tech-savvy individuals and beginners. The wide range of apps available on the Android platform truly enhances my tablet experience, from productivity tools to entertainment options. The camera quality is fantastic, capturing my precious moments with clarity and vividness. The expandable storage option is a game-changer, providing ample space for all my files, photos, and videos. The sound quality is impressive, delivering crisp and immersive audio for my favorite movies and music. Overall, this Android tablet has become my go-to device for work, entertainment, and everything in between. I highly recommend it to anyone in search of a reliable and feature-packed tablet!",
Good,
Love the larger screen and the colors are very bright . Great computer for the price .,
I have the 8gb ram and 320 gb hard drive and for me i think this computer is pretty fast and the price you can't beat that .,
I've had the pleasure of owning this laptop for over a year. With regular maintenance it's still as fast as the day I brought it home. I can have multiple open programs and still go right to the internet and have no lag or hang ups. The only thing I've noticed in the negative column is video hardware and memory. I ask a lot of this machine though and am never disappointed.,
"This is my ""go to"" travel laptop. It is cheap, fast, and has held up well to dragging it around the airports of the world. I did add memory (two additional banks) and a SSD drive (500MB) so it is probably as fast as a new model. The hard drive also works well as my backup storage since all I needed was a case for it. Best of all, it has both a VGA and a HDMI port for output... very handy for interfacing to older projectors and older video equipment. HDMI to older video equipment is always a big question. I use to carry five different types of adapters and hoped one would work. Now the E5410 works every time... YES!

You could probably spend a lot more but this is a great solid piece of gear that will do well on the road or in the office... And you can get a camera for it for $20 if that is important to you.",
works as promised and in great shap,
"Great little computer... Bought mine refurb and saved a lot of money, and it looks and acts like brand new.  Well worth the $150 purchase (I was patient to get a good deal)",
good one !!,
"I received this laptop for work and was expecting it to be fast given the processor speed and the 4GB of RAM.  So far, I have been disappointed in the speed of this machine.  I find that it freezes when I just have one Excel spreadsheet open.  This happened to me on multiple occassions since I received the laptop, but not all the time.  It seems that it freezes randomly.

I would normally suspect something new with the machine that is causing the problem, since I upgraded from a lesser machine recently.  For example, maybe it's Windows 7 Professsional or Office 2007.  This is not the case since I had the exact same operating system and applications on my previous laptop.

On a positive note, I really like the integrated mouse features, as you can customize them however you like.  Some of the great features are: ability to zoom using gestures similar to Apple's iPhone, fast scrolling, button customization, and more.",
"it was a bust for me, I'm sure it would work for someone else but it wasn't for me !!!!!",
"Dell Latitude E5410 Notebook - Core i5 i5-520M..Has met all of my expectations to far. I completely updated Windows 7 64bit, then allowed the upgrade to Windows 10 64bit. I also upgraded the memory to 8Gb with Crucial. com memory. This laptop is working perfectly at this time.",
"The packaging was in good shape -- no dents. But the item had broken plastic, and was all scratched up.
I'll never buy from this seller again.",
My other laptop bit the dust. After much research I selected this. So far it is doing everything that I had hoped for.,
Great item,
"Nice-sized and rather speedy for the most part for a 10 inch tablet due to they claiming it's got 4 GB RAM. Screen quality is fine for the most part, but battery life is not the best. I can play some semi-intense on-line games with very little problems, but this tablet won't do extremely graphic intensive gaming though. Connecting to my wifi is no problem with this tablet and for the most part, it's a great tablet. I use mine daily for checking emails, reading news and very lightweight game playing like solitaire and such. No cases made for this tablet....except for universal cases. 5 stars.",
Battery life,
Every Thing is Working Great,
"It has excellent screen quality, very good battery life and a good touch screen too!",
Love the quality of the picture.  Went from 8 in to 10 and it is exactly what I wanted.  Thanks,
"It claims to have the newest operating system, but that's false. The serial number in the tablet system settings is bogus and it doesn't have an IMEI number either. Needless to say the SIM card I bought for internet service doesn't work in it which makes it worthless.",
"I like it so far,but wish there was a case to fit this one!",
I vouldnt get it to Stay on. The screen saver or what ever that thing is comes up Can't view a thing have to keep turning it on and off to get it to work,
"I mostly use my tablet for playing puzzle or card games at night before going to bed. So it sits on my nightstand waiting to be used in the evening.  The other time I use it is for traveling on a plane to watch downloaded movies. I keep it in a padded case when not in use. I bought this Flying Tech tablet 6 months ago to replace my older Samsung. It worked well enough for the games.  I had a pattern lock on the device.  I took the tablet on a trip in August, used it on one leg of the trip, then when returning I pulled the tablet out, and the pattern lock would not unlock. I didn't forget the pattern and it had been in the case.  Now I have tried many times to unlock but am unable.  All info on the web says I need to factory reset.  So I have followed all the directions and get to the reboot screen but there is not an option to factory reset. The last time I tried I got a screen full of chinese characters so I just shut down the tablet.  Now I don't know what to do with it.  What a waste of money.  I just wanted a simple device to place games and movies on.",
Muy bueno,
"Bought this for my 7 year old granddaughter and it has met all our expectations.  She is able to play her games and read her books without any problems.  Worth the money.  My only problem is finding a case for this tablet, not all cases have camera on left side.",
I purchased this item strictly to download and play music off of and thought I was buying a 10 inch tablet like the description indicated. I was disappointed to receive a 9.5 inch tablet instead. You might want to revise the item description. A half inch makes a big difference for the purpose I am using it for.,
"Great product! Very fast, smooth, really like the sound. Very nice looking tablet. Was nice to see how clean this tablet is(no bloatware).  FLYINGTECH team product and support is awesome!",
"I bought this hoping I could play a couple of my games on it. It's hard for me to see my games on my phone so I wanted something with a larger screen. I did all the research. It met the requirements of the games and I didn't have a lot of money. I put one game on it and it would hardly run. Game runs fine on my wife's tablet and hers has the same amount memory and disk space as this one. So I use it for streaming videos, music, or doing my genealogy on. The1280x800 resolution is pretty nice. Next time I want to buy a tablet I'll save my pennies and fork out a little more money for it.
UPDATE: Both Flying Tech and Amazon have written to me offering me a refund on my tablet. No, I like the tablet. It came in handy for other things. It'll play games, just not the power hungry ones. I'm giving them another star just because they stepped up and wanted to help me out.",
"I bought this worthless piece of junk at the end of May/Beginning of June.  My battery stopped charging and FlyingTech said they don't have tablets or batteries for any tablets.  I don't know why they said that.  No one could help me at all.  Sent multiple Emails and finally called them about it.  I was so unhappy with them.
Then tried to see if Amazon could help me and they couldn't help me either.  The battery sucks.  DO NOT BUY THIS TABLET.  IT'S NOT WORTH YOUR TIME.",
"Great
Fast delivery",
I bought this for when my grandchildren visit so they could watch movies when they visit. I've since installed Disney Plus as well as some games for myself. Everything seems to work fine but I cannot figure out how to do screenshots and the pamphlet doesn't mention it so not sure if it's even a feature. Other than that minor issue I like this tablet.,
i cant use for remote desktop,
This took the place of my laptop. I am very pleased.,
"My iMac died and with another iMac already in the family I decided to expand (downsize?) to thos Chromebook. Now instead of using Apple to access Chrome, I use Chrome to access Apple. It works fine, with some learning and workarounds. CONS: no light on keyboard (wth?); keys are loud and clunky; it’s not a Mac; it runs mobile apps instead of software; when I need more, I have to borrow my husband’s Mac. PROS: Chrome and Google apps work great; saved about $1500 by switching; home now runs Apple and Android.",
DO NOT BUY! Received the item and it is not working.,
After just two week a ugly line popped up on my screen. it works fine but so annoying.,
"Only gripe I have, is its not like a regular laptop. I brought it to help me with my t shirt business, but, you can download certain software. It’s compatible with my printer for heat sublimations, but, for my Cricut vinyl cutter. Other than not being a windows base operating system, it’s pretty kool.",
"Just be forewarned that this keyboard layout has a full numeric keypad etc integrated into it.  And thus if you are used to a regular QWERTY keyboard, you will be unfamiliar with typing on this keyboard for a while.  We've asked different people to try and use it and every one of them has mistyped and it has caused major problems with using the computer if you are typing.

IF you are ok with the keyboard layout and can adjust somehow, it is a a decent Chromebook.

Speed / responsiveness is NOT fast.  I would suggest looking at a different, newer generation CPU chip.",
"I bought this on December 17th. Yesterday while I was using it, and was plugged in, it turned itself off. And that was the last of it. I have tested with another power cord just in case it was a matter of it not charging, but no. It is dead.",
Like the speed of the system!,
"I bought this Chromebook in March of 2021 and it's still going strong. It's an ""extra"" laptop that I use to bring out with me when I need a laptop but don't want to carry my work laptop which is much heavier. I also use it out in the garden (protected from weather of course). So far I've dropped it a few times but it still works like new. It's exactly what I needed for its purpose.",
Terrific. Love it,
"This was a gift for my daughter, to use for homeschool.  She was excited to get it and is using it all the time",
"The keys are too high, when you close it your finger oils get transferred to the screen. So every time you open it, you see an array of smudges in the shape of a keyboard.",
No tiene pantalla táctil,
Great laptop! No real complaints other than crappy speakers. Uber light. I’ve upgraded the Ram no it has 40GB. Really like that I can lay my iPhone on the touchpad to charge also.,
"I wanted an light laptop to replace my tablet that could actually last 8+ hours. This does it. Its incredibly light and it's fast enough for any basic life tasks, can play your basic games, and in battery saver + mode can do what I need it to do. I've gotten over 10 hours in battery saver plus just streaming movies, it looks and feels great. The screen is excellent but as other have said the built in speakers are sub par. I don't knock it for this because I don't really know of a scenario that this matters to me. I use earbuds when I travel and if I'm using this at home I would just use stream the audio through a speaker if in some universe I need to play music or something.

Highly recommend if you're looking for a good looking, ultra light, long lasting laptop.",
"The lap top is very much as described except the manufactures warranty. Laptop is supposed to be a new laptop with a year warranty according to the software the warranty expired more than a year ago.
also for anyone interested it had windows 10 installed with a link to upgrade to windows 11.
I will update this when i figure out what is going to happen with this warranty. I spent an hour on hold with Lenovo and never did actually talk to anybody .",
Better than my expecting? Perfect product and works well. I did ask a lot of questions before I bought this laptop and upload many pics for all of the external detail with another laptop on my table was MacBook Pro 13inch late2013 model.,
"I had ordered a few of these for out y company salesman before the cv19 lockdown nightmare. An was shocked how quick it was. As cv19 lockdown started, prices went up, a lot, availably went down. I was glad I was able to get a few more.
Rock solid Lenovo design and function.
Great laptop.",
"I like this laptop very much. It's sleek, small, fast and comfortable to use. It looks and feels sturdier than previously owned laptops and that is what you would expect from a Thinkpad seres. I bought the 8gb RAM and 256 SSD and so far it is just blazing fast and adqueate for most office tasks. I will soon put it to heavy test (statistical modelling and data/text mining) so I will see how that goes. I have one small but potentially annoying problem. Built-in mic stopped working a few days ago. Not sure what happened really as the mic appears to be installed but I tried with dozens of drivers and I have given up. I have read some people have had audio/mic issues with this laptop. Not sure if it is software of hardware problem, though. Most likely won't be sending it back since it's international shipping but just be aware that this may be an issue. Nothing that a good set of headphones cannot solve. Other than that, I am pretty confident this is the best laptop I have ever owned.",
"This laptop has been wonderful so far; I run the sims 4 on it successfully, which can be an issue on some computers. The graphics card is exactly what you would expect for the specs. Battery life could use improvement, but most laptops experience this; it does last a decent amount of time to get some work done; perhaps 2 or 3 hours if your programs aren't demanding a lot of processing power.",
"So when I was looking for a decent gaming laptop, I made an unprecedented turn to Lenovo.  I've never bought from them before, but with the deal (it was on sale) and the configuration, and honestly the reputation in the professional world, I decided to give them a try.

The good:  It is a 2019 era laptop, it (to me) was bought when they were starting to ship the 20 series nVidia gfx, literally if I waited 3 months, they were out..  That being said, the mobile 1660Ti is an amazing card and the i79750H packs a punch.  I mean, until you get to the bad part of this, the system ""IS"" really good.  Not too heavy, not too light (it is a performance laptop...) and a good screen on the LCD.  A real win.  Until.......

The bad:  Exactly 2 months after warranty expired (1 year warranty), one of the fans started making noise, then within days of infrequent use, stopped.  I tracked down the part number for the fan to replace it (helpful and useful info available on the Lenovo site, yea!!).  They use this company called encompass for all their official parts sales (this is the BIGGEST PROBLEM).  The part was ordered, and long story short, took over 6 months (ordered in October, received part in april, no joke).  This ONLY happened after I called Lenovo after several contact attempts with Encompass, who at one point CANCELED my order, only to then jack the price of the heatsink/fan combo (more on that later) from 58 to 89 dollars.  After complaining to Lenovo that they canceled my order and jacked the price up, my original ticket was reopened at the original price.  Still took 1.5 months (6 weeks) for a part to show up.  When it did, IT WAS USED!!  Had old thermal paste on it, but at that point I just didn't care, I used it as I was desperate to use my gaming laptop.  Mid April I installed my 'new to me, pad for new, got a used part' heatsink/fan.  3 weeks ago (so 2.5 months) IT DIED AGAIN.
I contacted encompass and did get an RMA, which I sent my bad unit back to them, at which they would send me a ""new"" replacement.  Guess what..  Shipping date ALREADY moved back 2 times, and now is saying the same thing it said the first time, ""NO ETA - FACTORY BACKORDER"".  I bet actual Lenovo tech's have no problem getting the part..  But I digress..  So two funny sidenotes about this.  1.  Encompass current price for the originall 58, then 89 dollar unit?  $160 bucks.  BOY has that thing gone up in price.  Funny bit #2?  The fan they use is actually a VERY common fan.  It is used on MANY HP, DELL, ACER and ASUS (if not more) laptops.  The difference is that Lenovo uses some form of plastic injection molding/melting process so the heatsink and fan are ONE assembly, whereas most other manufacturers use screws so at least if the fans fails, a tech or customer can easily remove the fan(s) alone and not have to replace the fans AND heatsink assembly.  To Lenovo's credit, it does seem at least one other version of the Y series laptop does in fact use removable fans, but I'm unable to tell if it was before or after this design.
It is simply for this reason I absolutely cannot recommend this product.  I shouldn't have to complain to Lenovo about their official parts supplier.  I shouldn't have to endlessly wait for 6 months once, and who knows how many more months for the next one to ship, based on my previous experience with them, this still practically new laptop is going to be useless by the time I get to actually use it again.  And will I have to call Lenovo AGAIN to actually make a part show up?  IDK, but it's not worth the hassle, and has absolutely left me scarred from making another Lenovo purchase.
The sad thing is, I work in a tech field, and our company uses hundreds of Lenovo laptops.  Their on-site repair team is top notch.  Their systems (they aren't GAMING units, business/enterprise class) run amazingly well.  (And yes, their tech's confirmed to me back in like December when I was in the middle of waiting the last time, THEY have that part, there's no shortage of ANY part to them).
The takeaway is if you are going to buy one of these, I would definitely buy an extended warranty through lenovo.  When it worked, I loved it, but since I've owned it, it's sat apart waiting on a fan more than I've gotten to use it.  Ugh.",
Camera didn't work,
"I've had this laptop for over a year , it has sat stationary at my desk during that whole time , I have had the charger , charge port, and power brick replaced 3 times in the the last 3 months due to failure , this laptop unplugged will last less than two hours and during that time will be insanely slow and stuttery, do not waste your money, getting support to fix a faulty product even with extra warranty's is A nightmare",
Note this a review for seller not the product. The 'k' key fell off the second time I use it. I suspect this a used product. I also noticed there is light scratch at the bottom of the laptop. Hope the seller is more stringent on the product quality.,
great,
Gaming,
"I like so much the product. It got 1 year guarantee and almost all features that Lenovo bring to us.
Is just like the description said also the 144 Hz screen is really nice to have it.

The temps are a little bit high (90-94) on Performance Mode but with some tweaks it will go normal (80-90 (just on little spikes) is almost stucked on 80-85 on Performance Mode while on Quiet Mode it cant go over 80ºC even is almost stuck on 75ºC) and maybe with repasting it could improve a little too.

The battery  lasts around 5-7 hours on normal load (Videos, coding) and on heavy load 3-5 hours depends on the process.

The camera is down the screen so i think with a base you could use it on a easy way.

I could suggest this for a first gaming laptop or just using it like a Workstation",
"1st Let's Honor Our God Aka Jesus Christ
GOD Is so wonderful which He Is Jesus Christ himself Blessing me a gaming laptop brand new in the box All wrap up this gaming laptop works really good there's one slightly problem it was not showing the wifi icon so I went to the network settings I turned it on then it kicked me out of it I try 2 times this was when I powered the pc up you know the welcome home start up for the 1st time so what I did look online for solutions after that I resetting the pc it runs so smoothie like butter on the cake",
Love it!,
I need to know this so I can order. I need a wifi model. Thanks,
Excellent,
Perfect,
Great,
good,
NICE,
works perfect.,
Nice tablet. Just as advertised,
They kiped simple and deliver as promes.,
a bit small but incredible power,
Did not work until after touching it 5 to 10 times and then sporadically only.  The worst thing that Inhave ever purchased,
good price but charger doesn't work,
"It has been a great tablet for my son and I. Camera quality is defiantly lacking, no flash on front face or rear. Is really my only complaint",
"This tablet is a great size and I really like the weight and look ok it ultra slim, but there is a lag in the software. Sometimes it can take a long time to load pages.",
So far so good... Hard to go wrong with anything Samsung !!!,
Got this for my son's 9th birthday.  It was in great shape when it arrived and we haven't had any problems with it.  I wouldn't have been able to tell it wasn't brand new if I hadn't purchased it myself.  I'm actually thinking about getting one for myself.,
"So far it has worked, HOWEVER when we got the tablet it still had ALL the previous owners information on it! Apps, pictures, and personal videos!!! Videos and pictures of their children! One would think that these would have been erased. Makes me not want to send any electronics back. How they refurbished this but left everything on it including their names is beside me!",
Anyone wanting to get this definitely should. I just received mines today and I'm so in love??best tablet I've gotten and I've gotten a few from amazon that didn't work at all. I'm so happy with this product. Has ton of memory I was able to download all the apps I wanted which totaled to 8 and he has stuff pre downloaded .,
"Product in bed condition. It takes days to charge the battery and it's getting worse every day.
I first wanted to return but I thought I will give it a try and replaced the charger thinking this might be the problem. It didn't work and now I'm stuck with it bc according to the return policy I can't return it.
Don't know what to do",
"We love ours! Looks and works like it's brand new! We previously owned a Nexus 7 and a Motorola Xoom. The screen and display are amazing, and the speed makes the Xoom feel like a computer from the 80's. Honestly I didn't even do my super price sluething like usual - but with the use we put our tablets thru, the price feels like a steal! Actually came 'here' to purchase a 2nd one :)",
"I liked my Tab 3 a little bit better.  But the Samsung customer service was the most ridiculous experience of my life.  I never thought any company could have worse customer service than Apple, I was wrong.  Which is very unfortunate, because I likely will never purchase a Samsung again, time to start looking elsewhere.  But as far as this particular unit goes, it works, I'm glad I didn't buy it brand new.  Seller was supportive.  I just question my future with Samsung products in general.",
"The tablet I received looks like brand new. Not a scratch on it works great.  Battery life so far has been awesome!  Second day running on first charge and still at 40% battery. I tried several $100 no name brands. They don't even come close to the quality of the Samsung and all had some cheaper screens that got almost invislable at even a slight angle. Not the Samsung, awesome clear screen even at an angle. I say save your self the time I wasted. Spend a few more bucks and get this awesome tablet over any of the $100 no names, you won't regret it.",
"The tablet came packaged well. I was a little confused when I turned it on and learned that it was actually a Galaxy Note. The serial number sticker on the back isn't actually what the real serial number is on the device. I actually like the note better! Better than expected. The only thing that I'm uncertain about is the battery life. It seems like the battery drains when it's in standby. I don't have another galaxy tablet to compare, but my iPad preserves it's battery when in standby. Not a great comparison, but that's all I have. I tried taking the battery out and setting it back in, but no change.",
Justo como la esperaba,
"We now have two of the Samsung Galaxy Tab 4.  These are a good size (8"") tablets.  I like the 16gb memory plus we added another 64gb with a micro sd card.  If you are considering purchasing a Samsung Galaxy tablet and are considering saving money by buying the 8gb instead and getting the large micro sd card, Don't Do It!!  The problem is all apps have to have a small amount of storage on your device regardless if you store the app on the sd card.  We have never had a problem running out of space with the 16gb SamSung Galaxy. We also have a third Samsung Galaxy 8gb, but we can't down load all the apps we should because of the issue I mentioned above.  I really like this Samsung Galaxy Tablet 4.  It is a really great Tablet.  The only issue you may find is that there are not many tablet cases designs to choose from due to the 8"" size. However, that does not reflect the great performance on this device.  I recommend the Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 SM-T330.",
Este equipo cumple con los que estaba esperando. Muy rápida y excelente laptop.,
Screen take to long to start,
"Very happy, much better than a HP.",
"The IDEARACE Intel i5 CPU comes with a power adapter, mini WiFi antennas, a HDMI cable and some SATA cables. It has 2 USB 3.0 ports and 4 standard USB ports, 2 HDMI display ports, 6 serial ports, and a speaker / mic jack. The mini PC measures about 9""W x 7""D x 2"" H with mounting holes on the bottom which could be used as a rack mounted unit.

The mini PC comes with Windows 10 Pro which is nice. It booted up clean with no bloatware. After loading the mini PC with essential basic software such as Norton antivirus and Chrome browser, it still has about 210 Gb of storage available.  The Wifi connection is also quite decent with the dual antennas.

Just like all the new PCs I received, I ran the PCmark benchmark on this unit right away which has a score of 1988. This about the same performance of a lower end 2018 Microsoft Surface Pro i5 laptop. Not a bad score but it is definitely not for high speed applications neither. The entire mini PC's case is made of good quality metal with heat sink type shapes all around for better heat dissipation. The unit does feel warm  but not burning hot neither when I laid my hand on the unit.

Overall, this mini PC is a good candidate as a general purpose desktop replacement. With the abundant amount of serial ports, it can be easily configured to control external hardware with additional programming.  It does not come with a user manual so some good experience with PC setup would be helpful.",
"First thing I would have to say about this mini PC is a fairly small computer. You cannot really install any additional attachment such as a low profile graphic card or another computer processor that is a bit stronger. You can however upgrade the ram and hard drive space if needed but you need to ensure that you get the appropriate ram and hard drive.  From what I can tell, it only has one slot for a single ram (standard 8 gb). This does run on older ram which is DDR3 (little disappointing). The hard drive it uses looks like an mSata drive and not an M2 drive which makes it a bit harder to upgrade as msata is not exactly new. Regardless of this, the system runs pretty well for just a mini PC. It does come with six serial ports, four x USB 3.0, four x USB 2.0 (why not make them all 3.0?), and two audio connectors. There is also two wifi antennas on the back that will pop out and you will need to ensure those do not get bent or broken as they are hard to replace. It comes with 8 gb of DDR3 ram which can be upgraded but I am unsure up to how much. It will be at least 16 gb but I do not have anything higher than a 16 gb for single stick to test that theory. There are only two HDMI ports to use for video output so you can actually run a multi screen build with this device. I did try it out and it ran okay. It was able to do your basic tasks while also watching a 4K movie on the other screen. There is no display port or DVI port which is a bit of a bummer. That being said you will get decent video quality using the HDMI port.  Upon opening it up, I saw that there is no fan in this and it does not run too hot. It runs pretty warm even when I push the computer. I found that to be a fairly decent design. It is a whole metal design so it is able to distribute the heat well throughout the computer. You are unable to install a 3.5 or 2.5 drive into this as there is no power or data connectors in this device. Although you can use this a media center computer, it works best with network and servers as you can plug in your network devices via serial ports on the back. You can easily access this device from afar when needed. There is no internal built in speakers so I would recommend if you are using this as a desktop to get a monitor with built in speakers to keep clutter down to a minimal. The device does feel a bit sluggish with the drive it is running on. There is built in wifi for 2.4 or 5 ghz. I would say it has enough USB to support the mouse, keyboard, and several ther things (most likely printer or webcam) if you want more then you will need to get an adapter. The mini PC is not too heavy as it is passively cooled. Can it run games? You basic games like minecraft can be run on it but it is not exactly meant for heavy gaming. I did try your basic games and it actually got really warm but nothing too dangerous to the PC. I also played multiple videos on there from my TV and it worked fine. It does come with windows 10 installed already so you do not have to purchase your own copy. There is bloatware that are installed on this really slows start up and I had to get rid of those. Overall I think this is a good size for a mini PC but I do feel like it does get throttled in performance due to not wanting to over heat the system. I also feel like it should have all USB 3.0 ports at this point. If you are looking for a PC that is really quiet and for your basic every day use than this will work. Just know that it does run on some older technology and you will be unable to make any real big upgrades to it.",
I needed a solution for remote access to deices that had serial console access and this fit the bill. I installed ubuntu server as I only needed this as a headless unit and created several minicom profiles allowing me to connect to several serial consoles using tmux. only issue I found was that serial ports 1 and 2 are too close that using standard serial cables where hard to connect to both serial 1 and 2 at the same time weird but no a deal breaker. Otherwise for my purpose the need was met nicely!,

"Pro is that it can be used as a tablet and it’s small and not bulky,however the con is the loading time for it to do anything on it is slow takes a full 2-3 mins to just load the internet that’s without searching anything just to load page could be a little faster on that aspect!",
"Love how light it is and fits in my large purse. I wish the keys lit up... always a nice feature.

"Know what you are buying.

This specific notebook has emmc HD storage 32gb, What does this mean?  It means there's no removable HD. It is physically soldered onto the motherboard. You can not upgrade the HD, no sata port at all.  With that being said this also comes with 4gb of ram, you can upgrade it your self to 8gb at a cost of around 30.00 this will help with speed.

It comes with Windows 10, the sysem will  upgrade itself eventually on you.  When this happens it will download a large file.  At the end of  this you will be left with about 4gb of free storage.  When you upgrade windows will create a file on your C drive called windows.old it is roughly 8gb, Thats the ""old"" version of windows 10.  Windows will automatically delete that file with in 10 days, or you can manually delete it. This will leave you with 11/12gb of storage for other applications, etc.

If you just want to surf the internet, random zoom meetings and check email. This could be for you.  Otherwise look for something more capable.",
the storage space is low. I had to buy a hard drive so I can have all of my documents and pictures.,
will be getting another soon. price is good for the value.,
Great package. I am impressed with the features that came with this laptop. Thank you.,
its slow to operate,
"I love the physical size of this computer.  But it can't handle Windows 10 and shouldn't be sold with Windows 10.

I bought it for travel, for weekends at my beach place, and a backup for when speaking.  I only need it for some light word processing, responding to email if it takes too much typing for a phone, and maybe projecting powerpoint if there were a compatibility problem with the host's computer.

The lag caused by Windows 10 in only 4 GB of RAM is tolerable for such light usage.  But 29 GB of storage is too little for Windows 10.  It leaves only about 6 GB for files and is too small for Windows to download updates.

Solution was simple and free. (a donation is appreciated)  Replace Windows with Linux.  I used the Mint flavor [distro] with the smallest version, xfce.  In some ways I like LibreOffice better than Microsoft Office.  Firefox is better than Edge.  As a bonus, your computer should be safer.

So I only gave four stars because I had to take the time to change the operating system.",
"After receiving this item, all Windows updates, uninstalled all unwanted software, installing Norton 360 & Office 365 we have < 5GB of free hard drive space. It runs slow as well.",
Great product easy to use,
It really is a good laptop I love how it goes all the way around and is really easy to use,
A very nice Chromebook. Looks brand new.,
Screen freezes up shuts off by its self touchscreen doesn’t always work having to reboot 6-7 times a day. Donated with list off issues to a food bank/store!!!!!!,
Using that computer now.  Everything is so easy with it. Really a great price.,
The packaging was very thoughtful and organized. It literally looks brand new! I am so happy with this purchase!!,
"Have 4 kids 5-10, got this to be a basic family computer, it’s perfect for them love they can each have their own profile with time limit",
The product was delivered in good time. Scale worked as per description.,
"Light weight, good value, plenty fast",
"The computer has been great, thus far.  The i5 processor performs well.  A few updates and you're ready to go.  This is as fast as my Elitebook used for work.",
"We purchased this laptop for home use only.  We typically use it for web browsing, Quicken, and Microsoft Office. We wanted a laptop that was lightweight and had a good display.  We were concerned about purchasing a refurbished laptop, so we expected it to show some wear. It looks brand new.  While we have not had it long, it is fast and working as expected.  We did purchase a two-year extended warranty. Even with the warranty, we felt we got a better laptop for less money,  We love its keyboard with the numeric pad, its fast bootup time, and its display quality.  Definitely would recommend it.",
Battery wouldn't hold a charge and Amazon refused to honor their exchange policy. Amazons customer service has really gone down hill.,
I feel items that are used or refurbished should have that noted at the beginning of the description. This description is misleading.,
Fast lightweight,
Really hard to believe I received a laptop that has no charging cord. There’s also no charge in the battery I’m  not even able to test it. Whoever that it was a good idea to sell a renewed laptop with no charging cord is a complete idiot.,
You don't notice this is a refurbished laptop at first. When you click on the item description you see Renewed.,
Nice,
Excellent computer for the money,
Excellent,
Great quality for price point!,
"The computer is great & fast delivery.
Continue with the good job.",
Screen quality is perfect and it’s worth to pay the money,
Worked as advertised. No immediate problems upon powering on and initial set up.,
"Excelente notebook para las prestaciones que da en relación a  precio/calidad, cumple con todas mis expectativas, 100% recomendable.",
"Everything you want in a laptop - snappy, fast, light, powerful.  no lemons in the 20 or so i've purchased.",
"The McAfee Lifesafe was a rouge Anti-Malware. Just outside the 1 year warranty period, the fans malfunctioned and wrecked the laptop. For a 10th gen, $1000 laptop, I'm very disappointed.",
The computer came with all of the hardware and software advertised.  No scratches or dings.  Good shape.,
Touch screen doesn't work but good laptop,
I needed a new laptop for my office.  I bought this used/refurbished laptop and it's exactly what was mentioned in the description.  Packaged very well.,
"10th generation intel core i5 laptop for home use, works perfectly for games and university assignments, good price, it is very well packaged received on time.",
I bought this laptop 3 months ago. The screen flicked yo the point of almost going completely black sometimes. Since it wasn’t doing it all the time I let it go but the day the network card failed was the lady straw. The next day it was working again. Realized this laptop wasn’t tone trusted so I returned it. My refund was almost $60.00 less than what I paid for it so I’ll not be buying computers from Amazon again.,
"The laptop seems to be a well done refurbished machine. It came with 8GB RAM, 250 GB SSD, wireless mouse, and charger. Along with a 30 day McAfee trial. The battery is lasting several hours between charges. So far very pleased.",
Video Player is loading.,
"I had to buy and return three previous laptops to finally get this one and it is great. I always said I would not buy a renewed laptop because I did not want someone else's problem. But after buying three other laptops and not getting the speed, quality and ease of use that I needed, I was becoming very disillusioned with my purchases. I could not believe that I could not find a laptop on Amazon. The speed and graphics of this Newest HP 15.6inch Lightweight Laptop, Intel Quad-Core i5-1035G1 Processor Up to 3.60 GHz, 8GB DDR4 RAM, 256GB SSD + 16GB Optane, HDMI, Bluetooth are amazing and I do not mind the small ding on the frame because it delivers what you would expect from a new laptop. I think it was more the fact that this seller truly understand that they can offer a quality product and still make a profit. When I first ordered this laptop, I thought I should have gotten a bigger discount because of its ""renewed"" status, but now I think I got a great deal because of speed and quality. This laptop is a so much better than what I was expecting after the three previous ""new"" duds I purchased. Please try this seller, BuyTek if you are looking for a renewed laptop.",
"The ""renewed"" laptop I purchased works fantastic.  Shipping was fast, packed well in what appeared to be the original OEM box, and best of all, it looked brand new.  The machine is fast, well equipped, and priced right.  I would definitely purchase again.",
"I ordered this HP 15.6inch Lightweight Laptop, Intel Quad-Core i5-1035G1 Processor Up to 3.60 GHz, 8GB DDR4 for my wife as a gift because she is starting her BSN and needed a new computer. Amazon renewed has a 90 day return policy on this item (very liberal return policy for almost any reason) which is something you don't get when you purchase a ""New"" computer usually. The item arrived as expected, no noticeable defects of any kind. Packaging was sufficient and all the accessories were included.  Performance wise: My wife is very happy and says that the computer's battery last a long time.  I will update this review if needed or if we experience any issues, otherwise this was a excellent purchase.",
I really love it,
i disliked spending a pretty penny to get something that felt worst than my 4 year old pc,
"I needed a small and portable, yet powerful computer for programming and working on image processing. This little computer fit the bill. I was worried it would be noisy but when it is very quiet. The fan does spin up when you are doing something CPU intensive but it is not overly noisy. I installed Linux on it very easily and everything works fine. I would recommend this computer if you need something small yet still has some power.",
Recomended!,
"Nothing, everything about it is horrible.  It Struggles to even turn on half the time and then when it does it always have to restart takes like five minutes a joke when you have a business so pissed so disappointed can’t return it now because I didn’t get CenturyLink out there in the time of the return I feel lied to and ripped off",
Video Player is loading.,
"When I received the 1st laptop I ordered, someone's accounts and information were on the laptop so I couldn't even unlock it. I received another replacement laptop. I synced my phone account with Microsoft Account on both devices and my phone was taken over by a hacker. I had to buy a new phone, create new email addresses, stop bank cards, start completely over again with new everything. There was a virus installed in the hard drive of Microsoft edge browser that can't be deleted or changed due to the permissions being corrupt. So I have this laptop just sitting here unable to even be used, smh. Thanks a lot",
For the price it was a great purchase. The touchscreen is great and the battery life is unexpectedly good. The only downside is the keyboard doesn’t have ten key. I would recommend this for the casual user,
"I have always bought hp computers. This was a fast, easy setup.
Much faster than my old one. Getting used to windows 11.",
"Unfortunately, was a bit bigger than expected, but the quality of the reconditioning was undeniable..",
Works amazing for our Etsy store we are opening up! Perfect for a small home business project.,
It comes up with Edge and no matter what I do I can't stop it.  It has very sharp edges which aren't fun as I work.  Just not at all what I had expected.  I suppose I shall keep it because to load everything on a different machine is too time consuming.,
battery life no good..have to leave plugged up..gaming..you got to set up propery for best gaming..but then great..,
"I owned the bigger one and now own this one. Reading the reviews are simply ridiculous. You have one reviewer giving it 3 stars because he didn't get the right license-which has absolutely nothing to do with the function of the laptop and then you have the other one reviewer who has forgotten it is a 12.5 inch screen laptop-So I will add my 2 cents on actual use.
1. First of all-It is considered an ""ultra book"" or small laptop-That is the FIRST thing you have to remember..
2. It is has ALL the high end features you find in larger laptops (14-15.6) in a 12.5 screen.
3. The screen is nice and crisp however the colors are a hit or miss...depending on what you are watching (seems that way even with TVs hence the various video options but remember..this is a small laptop)
4. Touchpad....its a touchpad-unless you have Hellboy hands-its just fine for normal people.
5. Speakers are just fine for a small room but then again-gotta slap yourself and remind yourself...its a laptop and a small one at that but it does have a speaker output for headphones.
6. Mic-It works as well as any other laptop. Using Audacity has proved 100% success.
7. CPU-Aww gee..I gotta remember...this is a laptop and a small one...but the i5/i7 cpus are perfect, especially with 16gb of ram and a 1tb SSD/NVME-its fast however I am not going to be making movies or anything major because if I was...I would get a bigger screened laptop..duh!
8. KB is just fine and its lit up.
9. Wireless-Just as good as other laptops but with 5g capability AND a sim card input for broadband on the go.
10. Portability-Woah...now we got to the meat section. Its light...its thin and its easy to carry
11. Battery life...woaaahh no more negative nancy here...10-12 hours on one charge..Now all that petty complaining turns out to be...pointless
12. Applications-Runs multiple apps at one time-no sweat. Very fast wake up from sleep and reboots are seconds..
13. The chassis-Strong and durable. made of magnesium and feels solid.
14. The touch screen..yes...it comes with a touch screen.

So folks...these are low in price now. Which is why I waited...its well worth it if you get one now-it was worth it back then..but before you call yourself an expert...make sure you are buying it for what you need.",
"Screen:
Terrible viewing angle. IT has a sweet spot of maybe 10 degrees. The colors are washed out or too contrasted. There is no 'good' angle.

Touchpad:
Too small. The click buttons dont feel great.

Speakers:
Inadequate. Too quiet. They face the desk.

Microphone:
Low quality. Hard to hear if there is any background noise.

CPU:
Undersized for a laptop pushing 1200 dollars. We use these as development laptops and this computer is the bane of my existence. It has turbo boost up to 3.8ghz or something but because the cooling for this laptop is so inadequate I can rarely sustain that speed.

Keyboard:
Meh. Not terrible not great. It works.",
"Good design and strong performance. But its screen has only 1 viewing angle, the resolution of only 1368 is too low and not sharp. This is a big minus point of it.",
"Where's my Windows 10 Pro license? The two laptops I ordered came with Windows HOME edition, which is NOT what the specs above list.",
"I've purchased two of these machines. They're not all identical, though. When I needed a different spec, the sellers were easy to work with and exchanged the laptop with a different one in short order.",
Product was received exactly as advertised. Beautiful performance so far and I'm loving it. Packaging by Seller and international delivery by DHL was great. Both Seller and Carrier highly recommended.,
"This laptop is a workhorse in a tiny package. It's able to out play a workstation I purpose built for performance for the same price from a few years ago.

Being able to play basically any game I want at full/Ultra settings is fantastic, and because it's got 12 usable cores it provides an excellent experience with CPU intensive workloads.

It could be clearer how to change the lighting settings, but otherwise it's a fantastic piece of tech.",
"This machine KICKS it in to high gear. The 3080ti complete with 16gb ddr6 and the DDR5 with 32 GB ram make this machine FLY! At 1440 and playing ultra I can tell you after owning 3 MSI gaming laptops in the last couple years, this by far is the best. Windows 11 and the cooling system are unreal. Seems much more quiet than than the previous generation.",
I have owned this for a month and have played 25 games on it.  I got the 3080 ti i7 with a qhd screen and this baby is fast with temp in the 70's.  It has never crashed and have never had the blue screen of death.  I read the only 1 star review of this laptop on here by lenardo and all I can say is i think he got himself a lemmon.  It happens with all brands of laptops and he should have returned it on day one instead of keeping it and posting a one star review.  Also he demands that no one should buy it.  I bought it and havent had a single problem with it just like hundreds of others including professional reviewers.  I would recommemd not buying.it from a shady seller to save a few dollars. I bought mine from a major retailer for 3450 dollars with  no regrets.,
"I bought this to games on steam, some apex legends, league of legends etc. However, this thing has MAJOR issues. When I try to play FFXI, it crashes randomly without any notice. It's very frustrating to be playing an MMORPG and with the computer being updated having all these issues. It has happened since day 1. Even after going through the startup sequence there were loading issues and crashes of programs. This is the first AND LAST MSI laptop I will ever buy. Thing also gets way too hot.",
"Awesome. Just love the performance of this machine.  Setting up was quite easy.  Except for the “bright screen issue” but got that sorted fast.  High FPS on COD , PuBG, Apex Legends, 7days to Die and New World.
Honestly i cant complain this far.",
Se siente que se encuentra en buen estado los ventiladores suenan cuando se encuentra un proceso fuerte pero está en buen estado,
I use my laptop on the go a lot so I need a laptop with a pretty good battery life. With this laptop I got under 2 hours of battery before I had to plug it in to an outlet. Other than that it works fine,
"I didn't want to spend a lot of money on a Laptop. I'm a Mobile Tech, so my gear takes a beating. I shopped all weekend and settled on buying a new Unit from a Big Box Store, but come Monday the sale was over and the price went up $250.. Doh!

There are loads of Refurbished Laptops for sale everywhere and I was skeptical for sure. But the price was right and I took a chance. My Unit was advertised as in Excellent Condition and it was... Not a scratch on it.
The only thing that gives it away as a used piece are the slight witness marks on the Palm Rests where you lay you hands. So it must have been used in a business application by someone that typed a lot but took good care of it.

The Processor and Ram specs are great and rated as Battleship on PC UserBenchmark! The new Unit I was looking at was not this powerful and more expensive even on sale. This Unit is 3 years old at most going by the Processor manufacturer date. I have 4 Desktops in service and this Laptop is faster than all of them, LOL! The onboard Video Card is fine for HD Video but not intended demanding Games which is fine because that's not what I bought it for..

I've used it 2 days at work now and the Battery lasted all day where I was recharging my old Dual Core Unit by mid day.. I took the opportunity to do the free upgraded to Windows 11 and it's nice so far. This Unit was $1200 new so $400 was a GREAT DEAL! The 90 day return is good piece of mind.",
False advertisement. It does not come with a keyboard or a Case. When I contacted Amazon they told me maybe it's an error so they ordered a replacement when I got the replacement it was the same issue no case or keyboard. Amazon needs to look into this issue.,
"WORKS WELL ENOUGH FOR MOST PURPOSES, BUT TWO GREAT FLAWS.  I still need a charger, because the USB end of the charging cable cannot fit the charger I was sent.

Second, and most importantly, the phablet does mot work. People who call me  report they can hear me loud and clear, but I have been able to hear them once very faintly, and no other time since.",
"Field work, recording, photos.",
"The tablet is really great. The touch screen works superb and the tab is light weight. It looks very decent and functions well.
The only issue I got after I received it. This model usually comes with a SIM slot. When I got this tab, i noticed there is no SIM slot. I am in India and this model has a 4g SIM Slot but possibly I purchased it from USA and the might not have a SIM slot in USA? Not sure!",
I like most aspects of this tablet. It is easy to use and it seems to work well. The only thing I don't like is that the screen reflects too much light when I use it in a room that has high light levels. The battery life appears to be shorter than I expected but that may be due to how often I am using the device as I am learning how to use this new tablet.,
"its an ok tablet. it runs smooth, battery is long lasting, sound is good. reasons why i gave a 3 stars are: camera isnt all that great, camera doesnt have built in flash, the video player that came with it never works when you try to open a video file, menu buttons at the bottom dont light up whatsoever which makes it very difficult to locate the buttons. the setting doesnt give you a lot of power to modify things the way you want your tablet to be, in  other word its very limited. the android verson that came with it is such an disappointment especially when you use the add user function and many more things i can complain about.",
"I received the Samsung Tab Monday afternoon. It was defective right out of the box. While I was setting up the tablet it started going black every few seconds. I thought it was because it was not fully charged. I went a head and set it up. I then turned it off and fully charged it. I started to use it again and if I stopped for any reason it would go black and I would have to hit the power button to get the screen again. I tired to work with it and just gave up. This morning (Tuesday) I went on line to chat with the Samsung Support. I installed the program that allowed the tech to access my tablet.
He checked it out and recommend I set it back to factory re stall. I did and then I could not even work to set it up again as it kept going black.
The Samsung tech said it was most likely a factory defect and I could take it to a Samsung repair shop to have it fixed for free. That is not acceptable for me to have to repair a brand new tablet. So I am sending it back. I am not sure if I will purchase another Samsung Tablet A
or go with another brand. I will have to think about it for a while. I liked the size and look of the tablet, it just would not stay on long enough for me to use it.",
"Not bad. The price can't beat. I'm beginning to think that all Samsungs burn through their batteries very quickly. The graphics aren't amazing, and the processor is decent. You have to realize that this is a low/mid range priced tablet, so you're going to get low/mid range quality out of it. I haven't had a problem with it yet, so I would say its pretty good.",
"It's a decent tablet for the price. Not as easy to navigate with as an iPad, but that is probably because I am used to apple products. I had difficulty getting the Bluetooth to work, it took me about a week to get the software to cooperate. I bought this tablet mainly to use for Netflix and occasional internet research. It serves its purpose for what I need. Overall, it's a good cheaper alternative to an iPad.",
I bought this for my wife who is not a techie. Her primary use is to read books and I wanted her to have a larger screen than her cellphone that she had been using. I fully realized there were Samsung tablets with better specs but at MUCH higher prices. I also knew she would not be as critical as I am and the simple fact of the larger screen would make her happy. I agree it's not the sharpest screen but she had not said that as in this case ignorance is truly bliss. I consider it a great value.,
I really like this tablet. It's smoothe and so big. We got three for our kids for Christmas. They are currently using some really old Galaxy tab 3. So honestly compared to that this galaxy will be like a luxury vehicle. It updated to the newest Android 7.0 pretty much as soon as we turned it on. We played Minecraft on them for about an HR because that's mainly what our kids play  and it worked well.  So far these tablets are doing exactly what they are supposed too.,
"Perfect for my mom! Unless you need an expensive iPad for whatever reason, get this and save some money. I was considering getting her an iPad but she doesn't use any fancy app's and just wanted for basic internet browsing usage.

P.S. - the screen goes much brighter if you turn off the auto-dim function. Was almost going to return it and saw the suggestion on another review. The screen is just ok turned all the way up, but if you turn off the auto-bright function, its much brighter.",
I bought a screen protector for this and it may be the reason this is so slow to respond to touch commands. I am not sure. I bought this to replace an old Tab2 and it doesn't work any better than my old one.,
"I love this tablet I've been using it in my everyday life. I'm even writing this review on it. I would definitely purchase another Samsung Galaxy Tab tablet if this one were to ever die on me. I was apprehensive of the color of first but it started to grow on me. I do everything from reading books Kama to browsing the web, to taking pictures, Skype excetera. As of today I have no qualms or problems or dislikes of this product. And honestly it's a great product to give people first before they upgrade to a new android cell phone, which was helpful for my parents when I let them borrow it",
It is much better than the last tablet I had (wasn't a Samsung). Still learning how to do get around in it. I have watched movies on it at home and in airplane. For the price you can't beat it. (Bought it over Christmas on a special from Amazon with free shipping which was lower than the special they had on it at the local WMT.). Only purchase phones and tablets with external storage available and of course this tablet has it. I am a retired old fart and it does everything I need except maybe a nice lady to meet and have coffee with. ha.,
"it's an ok tablet - nice size..  but pretty much the photos are horrendous. they turn out dark, & if what you're taking a photo of moves even a fraction of an inch, it's blurry. i didn't think the camera was supposed to be that bad, but it really is. if anyone knows how to improve it, let me know. i already tried putting it in sport mode, but it doesn't do all that much. since i was planning on using this when i go up north to take some photos (even tho i have cameras), i'm pretty disappointed in it & wonder why on earth i bought it. my older galaxy 2 epic took better photos than this thing! perhaps it'll be a little better if i'm outside & there's some sun or something..",
"we needed a cheap tablet for our Point of sale system at our small shop.  This one works perfectly!  plenty big enough for the square app, fast speed, no wi fi issues.  Just great overall.  Only small issue is it doesn't seem to like having more than one bluetooth device connected.  It can do it, but it gets finicky and may drop one device over another.  Irritating since we have to have one of our square readers connected via bluetooth but also want to stream music in the shop on bluetooth speakers.  I'm sure there's a workaround.",
"Purchased as a refurb - everything appears to be perfect except some very minor scratches on the screen.

Tablet works perfectly - fast and smooth.  It even rendered a rather large detailed drawing in a reasonably short amount of time, allowing scrolling and zooming seamlessly.  Rear camera took an adequate picture, and the front is of course fairly low resolution.  Screen was bright and clear, gave a good enough picture on Netflix and YouTube to be easily watchable.

Physically the tablet is very light and slim.  It feels as if it's a bit fragile, so I'll be very careful with it until its new case arrives.",
"I have had good luck with my last 2 Samsung phones, so when the time came to replace my tablet Samsung was a natural choice.  Ordered from Amazon Warehouse Deals, Prime shipping rocks.  The tablet works great, lags a bit loading some Web pages but that is to be expected.  Downloaded all of my apps from Google within the first hour and synced all my emails and accounts.  Seems to have plenty of ram and processor,  and the SD slot allows plenty of storage.  Haven't really tested the battery yet but it seems to last as long as my phone, about a day with intermittent use.",
I purchased this mainly to cast music to my amplifier via Bluetooth and MDC BluOS. It works well for all of the things I use my Galaxy S7 phone for except making calls. It is nice to have a larger screen with my old eyes. The unit performs flawlessly. It has exceeded all of my expectations. With an added 64GB memory card I can easily store my music and photos. I use it when I visit my mother who is in a nursing home to show her photos of the family and friends. Before I would bring my laptop.,
"I got this tablet to replace an old Lenovo that finally bit the dust. The Galaxy tab A 8"" has a nicer resolution. It works great for light games, surfing the internet, email, and videos. This tablet is user friendly and the processor is quick and handles applications easily. The picture quality for videos is pretty good and the sound isn't bad either. As far as picture quality goes, I'd say that it's so-so, but I didn't buy it for it's camera. Very convenient for me to take along while travelling abroad because the battery life in my opinion is excellent! Can't beat this for the money!",
"Bought in May 2019
Took 2 years to find a case which fit as model year was ambiguous 2017 or 2019? Samsung likes to confuse people as tablet model dimensions and controls locations are moved every year.
Apart from that, tablet speed was never very good and has degraded in past 2 years. It has gotten so bad I am getting rid of it and will use it for target practice. Piece of junk.
Also memory usage is crazy as instead of 16 GB, usable memory has degraded to almost nothing 1 GB or less. I don't store pix, video etc in internal memory and haven't downloaded many apps from playstore.
Device refuses to tell me where is all the storage going. Very frustrating.
I won't buy Samsung tablets again!",
"I am in love with this tablet. I was torn for months on which one to get after my Kindle broke. I'm happy to say that I'm very pleased with my purchase. The screen is an ample size, the device itself has plenty of memory, and there's tons of customization options. Sometimes with Androids, though, where the settings are can get a little lost in translation. So you have to go digging for them. But it's no issue.

The only downfall is the speaker is down on the bottom of the device, near the home button. . . which is just weird. But okay. I can live with that. For a cheap tablet, it's really a live-able mistake.",
"Performance doesn't feel that great even when is brand new, but then, it is old technology and it is for my mom so not a lot needed.
It all depends what are you looking for in it. If all you do is basic tasks, browse your social media, read articles, books, pay your bills, etc, this is enough.
If you do more advanced takes, I would not recommend it.",
"Great tablet in the price range.  Has all the features you would expect from Samsung.  Took a 64GB micro SD card and now it has lots of storage.  No issues with wireless or bluetooth connectivity or range.  It plays movies and runs apps without issue.  The screen is not as nice as my Tab Pro, but it is still daylight visible and crisp.  Have had several Samsung tablets and will continue to buy them.  I usually upgrade when I lose one.",
"Works good. I got this for my nephew. He's into games and music so it works great for him.  It has 16 GB of storage and works on a 1.5 GB RAM. The size is perfect for him. 8"" is a good size for a tablet in my opinion. Runs on Marshmallow. I was a little disappointed because it does not have the Samsung Theme Store but its not a big issue.
Good for kids or people who just want a tablet to watch videos and do light gaming.",
"I wish I had read the specs more and realized how low the memory was...but outside of that it has been an amazing tablet.  Picture, sound and performance is really good.  I typically use it for recipes, games, music and streaming videos and has never had a problem.  I have been a huge supporter of the Samsung product and think its far more superior than other brands. I love that I can manipulate my own data as I please and not having to go through an app to change, delete, edit or add - Yes, Samsung has a lot of bloatware but can be removed.",
"This arrived in a very timely fashion, and It looked new to me.  After running all the updates the device worked perfectly.  The packaging was very secure and easy to open.  I am very happy with this transaction.  The product itself is a very functional tablet.  Great for quick research when you don't want to get up from the couch, great for watching movies on a plane.  I love how dark it can get as i like to read at night in a dark room and a too bright screen can give me a headache.  Overall I am very pleased with the product.",
"One complaint: Why no info on how to see/download/obtain a user manual?  When I finally contacted Samsung by phone I was e-mailed a lengthy link to download a copy ... and the first instruction in it was to read the manual BEFORE using the device.  (Of course I had been using it to try to FIND the manual.)  I like the device itself though I have yet to figure out how to use it as a full-function e-reader --- or can it do that?  As you can tell I am not a ""techie.""",
"I understand that this is a used product but that being said I have a question. Does anybody sell Fully functioning used equipment? This unit works flawlessly. The charge port however does not. It will act as if it has been plugged in but barely charges sometimes, next time it will charge just fine as long as the cord lays a certain way. Yes I’ve tried 3 different cords including another brand new OEM Samsung cord. Just tired of purchasing broken stuff from dishonest sellers.",
"Happy, happy, joy, joy. I was super tired of watching Netflix on my phone! I wanted a bigger screen. My kid shouldn't be the only one that can have a tablet. LOL. This does exactly what I need it to and it works quickly and well. Definitely recommend if you're just needing a tablet for basic day-to-day stuff. I haven't tested it out for more work related tasks but I'm happy to say it comes with Microsoft Office Works as well. I pretty much see this tablet filling every need I may have.",
"What else can I say?  This tablet does just about everything the average user would need. It is relatively fast the speed depending on what WiFi you are connected to.  The size is just about perfect for carrying around with your choice of cases. My recommendation on the cases is that you purchase two of them. Buy a Poetic Turtle Skin Grip Corner/Bumper Case and also get yourself a thin leatherette HDE  Case - Ultra Slim Lightweight Folio Smart Cover. Check these out on the Web I think you will agree with me. I researched this thoroughly.
I would recommend this tablet to anyone I know.  Get one (a new one) before they sell out..!!",
"I've had this tablet a few days and so far I'm very happy with its performance.  The battery life is good as I've only charged it once in the two days that I've owned it.  The speed at which it operates is good too with the Android 6.0 OS.  App speed and app download speeds from Google play are good too.  The size of the tablet is perfect for viewing movies and videos with decent resolution.  I added a micro-SD card for increased storage capacity.  But because of the tablet's slim size, I found that having a decent case allowed me to hold it better.  Overall, it was a good buy at that price.",
"Still not sure how to rate this thing, has been problematic since day one.  I bought it mainly to watch movies from my massive PLEX servers which stream high data rates but yet the tablet rarely connects to the servers.  The tablet shuts down without any input within 10 seconds from last command.  Still having trouble with Facebook, YouTube and e-mail so I'm not sure if this is user error or just a bad tablet.  I'm having my nephew go over it to make sure it is the tablet and not me (I've been around since the telegraph was high-tech, lol) just in case I need to return it.  I was able to find a PDF file with the entire operators manual for it but at 110 pages it seems like a lot of reading to just use some simple aps and commands.  I'll update in the near future to let people interested know the outcome.",
"This thing is great so far. The battery seems like it will last very long on a full charge and it’s the perfect size when holding horizontally. I wouldn’t say it’s blazing fast but for the price it runs very well, I’d be surprised to find a better value out there for a tablet. I’m struggling to find anything that I don’t like about it so far, and the only thing I’d point out is that the back plastic is fairly slick. It wants to slide out of your hands a bit while your holding it but I imagine that’ll change when I put a case on it",
"These are 2015 models. I bought this tablet for my wife to use for her video chats on places like Messenger and Skype. This tablet is using Android 7.1 currently, and it is the latest update. The rendered picture during a video chat is extremely dark.  You cannot even tell who is doing the talking unless you put a flashlight in the speaker's face. I have tried it on two different chat ""systems,"" and same result. I have tried several changes, and even reset everything back to the default settings. Some internet critics have stated this model needed a software correction two years ago, yet Samsung has not provided a correction. Other performance items of this tablet are okay. Still pictures are good, performance is nice. It is just terrible during video chats. I have only had this tablet for just over a week, but I am considering returning it.",
I had This Tablet Since July 2016 And It Broke Last Year Mainly Cause me if I didn't done what I did I would still have it.,
"My second try with an Android device, and my experience is a little better but not great. I'm constantly bumping the screen or causing the screen to pop a series choices I don't want, I can barely get through an article I want to read. Play You-tube videos is frustrating since I inevitable hit a different video half way through and there's no back button on the terrible YouTube app. On the positive side  the screen is very nice with great detail it is useful for reading emails and responding. In general I still think Android is the problem, it still feels like a cheap imitation to IOS, I don't like the behavior of the home screen or how I have to select apps, I don't like having to root the device to get rid of Chrome which I neither need or want and considering the space used by native pre-installed apps I was hoping that I'd have more control with Android. I originally bought the device to read magazines, and this it does very well using Google News stand app. Would I recommend this device, no save you money and get an iPad like I will end up doing or just get a cheap Android tablet, Android isn't worth spending a lot of money on. I was really hopeful that I'd love this device, I'd seen it in person and I'd liked the hardware, but I see I will just sell it and by an iPad.",
Sigh...I can't review it.  I bought it for my mom & she never uses it.  I wish I knew if it's good or not but sadly it will eventually become obsolete & sold for pennies on eBay.  ...Sigh...  She said she wanted a tablet on Black Friday so I got her a good one.  She soon realized she doesn't know how to use it nor is she willing to learn how to use a tablet. ...Sigh...  I think she leaves it out in plain sight when I visit cause it's always near the couch but I know shes not using it...  ...Sigh...  That's my honest review.  ...Sigh...,
I bought this as a Christmas present for my 7 year old daughter. She was using an outdated Kindle Fire and she was getting frustrated because it was slow and she could not download Google Play games. She loves her new tablet! I bought a similar one for son last year so I knew this tablet would be good. This tablet is even better than the Samsung my son has. The screen is a lot bigger and it has more memory. It was easy to set up and it has Samsung Kids if you want to make sure little ones aren't viewing inappropriate content. I would definitely buy this tablet again!,
"First, this thing is so slippery I had to cover it with masking tape just to keep it from slipping around like a slimy fish. And where ever the screen is touched, some function turns on or off.  Trying to read a book on it is almost impossible unless you are comatose and can't move or breathe. You find your place and when you touch the device to set it down somewhere, it suddenly magnifies/decreases the page, turns on or off, goes ahead/behind to another chapter/page. Pick it up to correct it and it slips through your fingers like a wet fish.  After you have climbed out of bed to catch it again and find your place, and maybe even set the timer, then you have to place the weanie speakers right up to your ears because if you are the kind of person who likes to breathe, you won't be able to hear it because the volume is on the back of the unitand is very very weak.  So you can't see what you're doing plus HEAR anything at the same time.  Forget about listening to this thing in the car on the way to your knitting class.  Also, every time you turn on the wi fi to say, download a book, prepare to wait about 15 minutes and to lose about 98% of your battery before you can actually use it again.  When all updates are finally finished you only have 2% battery and have to recharge before listening to your audio book or checking your email. In the middle of doing anything it freezes up because suddenly you have 17 mysterious gigabytes trying to run at one time.  It is nothing at all like the more substantial Tab 2.  Its a fail :(",
"Our 1st generation ipad mini has come to a crawl after all these years.  We made it a kids tablet for our little one and needed a replacement but without the ""premium"" tax.  For sub $200 category, this offers a lot.  The display isn't anything to write home about, but for it's screens size it gets the job done.  it's nice and lightweight that my wife can throw in her purse or bag.  it has a good build, it doesn't feel disposable.  i don't expect this too last as long as the 1st gen ipad mini but that's fine because the android OS update support stops after 1-2 years anyways, which gives us a reason to get another one since it's very affordable.",
"Giving this rating for now because there might be an issue with the battery.  As soon as the tablet arrived I opened it and immediately without powering on the device I plugged in the charger and it displayed a battery power of 56%. I  initially charged it to full capacity. The table was not used at all after the full charged; I packaged it up with the power off. The very next day the table will not powered on.  I was shocked as to why it would not turned on after I had already gave it a fully charged. I thought it is a defected device; I connect the power charger on and the battery life level is at a zero power. How can this be!!! when it was at 100% just the day before and was never used and in powered off.  So ended up having to charge it again from 0% and charging is very slow.

I bought two - white and smokey blue.  Ironically, the same problem occurred with the other table.",
"For the price, I doubt you can do much better than this. Fast, feature packed, and functional. My only real gripe is the resolution. I knew it wasn't going to blow me away, but I did expect it to be better than what it is. The apps on the home screen look pixelated, and Web pages aren't as pretty as they are on my Galaxy S5. Netflix looks fine, but it still seems lacking. I feel kind of silly complaining, for the price you can't do better, and I'd gladly sacrifice a little resolution for a <$150 tablet. But I still thought it'd be better than what it is.",
"Yes! First off,  I love Samsung products, and when I heard about this one, I was eager to purchase it and replace my dinosaur of a tablet. The tablet has a lot of great features especially Sidesync. It would be awesome if you could see the tablet on the phone with  sidesync.  Don't know if that's possible yet. I really love the 8 inch size. It's ""Goldilocks ""(not too big, and not too small).  It's great that Microsoft software is pre-installed on the tablet. I don't have any major complaints except it doesn't have Swipe. I'm so used to using it on my phone. It also would be nice to be able to put like apps in one folder (just a little bit OCD on that one). Otherwise great tablet and I'm glad I purchased it!",
"Decent tablet for the price, nothing too fancy by any means, but has a good display, super light weight and it's a nice iPad Mini like size.

I would recommend anyone in this price range either spend a little more or find a used iPad Mini instead. This isn't a BAD tablet, but it's a $199 tablet at best. Over all it's fine for web browsing and reading books but not good for anything more than that. It struggles with anything graphic intensive. Even just loading webpages and apps it's not very fast. Just slow performance from something that's brand new for 2015..

It's a tablet, it does tablet things. It looks nice, it's lightweight. If you like the Samsung ecosystem you're good to go there. I wish the menu / back buttons on the bottom were illuminated like they are on the Samsung phones..

My last issue is there is a lack of accessories. Just a bunch of ""folio"" type cases.. I'd prefer something more rugged. But that's a result of the tablet being so new.. so not really a fault of the tablet.

It's okay. Not too impressed. Just a tablet by Samsung.",
Great all around tablet.  I have three in my family.  It does what you expect it to. Resolution is decent and it never has connectivity issues.  The apps are smooth with little lag. The rear camera is mediocre at 5 mp. Low light shots are abyssmal.  This is a tablet and not a digital camera but many people take pictures at family events/gatherings. Samsung really cut corners here and must do better with that. Battery life is very good surprisingly. All around it is very good for daily use and streaming movies.  There aren't many decent tablets being made from any manufacturer.  This one is a good value for the money.,
"I needed a replacement for a four year old Asus Transformer tablet that was near top of the line when I bough the it.  I didn't want to break the bank and wanted something smaller, more book sized for reading and travel. For the prove this tablet has been great.  Good screen,  good battery life,  great form factor. The only thing I wasn't keen on was the built in memory and Touch Wiz.  The default amount of built in memory should be 32GB.  Touch Wiz puts a lot of crap between you and the OS, but it's not horrible and at least it's stable. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a good tab at a good price.",
"This Tab A if awesome,even though the screen is low rent and what i mean by that is that it isnt 1080p it is 720p but it looks very nice,Sammy does very well with color saturation to make everything ""pop"" viewing movies on this is very good and it does very well with games even though is only has 1.2 GHZ , wish it had more space,having 16 gigs is like having 8 gigs in today's world.its quickly fills up,but being able to add more storage is a good thing i have 64 gig micro sd card in my tab but iam not able to move eveything over to the card so thats a bummer,but back to the tab,its an excellent tablet for the budget minded.i would highly recommend to my friends,ooh btw..i bought 2 of these tabs and havent had any issues whats so ever with frieezeing or crashing,they both work wonderfully.",
"I've had the Tab A for about a month--have been using it with an OMOTON smart case, an Anker Bluetooth keyboard, and an iKross collapsible stand.  I love it. Very portable and convenient-it does what I want (mainly email, internet, writing).  More inviting than a full-size laptop and easy to use anywhere (the car, the kitchen table, etc.), which makes it easier to get past writers block  (I can use my smartphone as a Wi-Fi hotspot for internet connectivity if need be). The 8"" is just the right size for me--screen is big enough to read web pages comfortably but still very portable . No complaints about the screen resolution (I don't watch video on it or play games).  Bluetooth connectivity works well (occasional, rare, connection blips).  Long-lasting charge.  Got helpful free phone support from Samsung. [Note:  The advertised free Word and other MS Office applications are extremely limited--not worth downloading.]",
"I forgot how good it feels to use droid! After using my apple phone for so long I was afraid to buy the Samsung tablet, mostly for fear of its complexity. However, I love this tablet. I was originally going to purchase the 9.7 inch version because I wanted a large screen for videos and Web surfing. After reading those reviews and finding the resolution is similar between sizes, I chose the 8 inch for cost efficiency. It's the right size for on-the-go and the resolution is beautiful. I was able to get this tablet, a one year warranty and a case and screen protectors well under the cost of the 9.7 inch tablet. I am extremely happy with my purchase (no buyers remorse) and if you want a fun take with you tablet, this Samsung galaxy A is an excellent choice. I hope it stays this way after the ""honeymoon phase"" is over.",
"I own an ipad mini 2 and was a bit hesitant purchasing this tablet but upon receiving it I was very pleasantly surprised by it.
I had checked it out at a box store and was going back and forth about buying one but now that I did I am very happy.
Everything is great. This is a fine unit for the price.

I wish it had two speakers but that is not an issue as I will use my bluetooth speakers when I watch something on it. The picture is quite clear and I have not problems in reading text either.

The sound is not as good as my ipad but that is not a big issue.  The screen and body size is almost the same .. Sometimes I forget which unit I am using..

This a a nice unit.. I highly recommend it.",
"A great tablet for the price, but it gets slow sometimes. The screen is nice and sharp. It came with Microsoft Word, Excel, & Power Point which are nice to have but I think they might be taking up a lot of space. There was less than 6gb  remaining with everything loaded. You might be happier getting 32gb. Also, the camera sucks (hence the 4 stars). Camera on my IPhone is much better, but I did not get this tablet to take photos. I use it for FB, email, playing games, and checking the internet while I am at home. As I said, it is a nice little tablet, but you need to decide if it's what you're looking for.",
"I love my new tablet!  I am still learning about so I can't discuss everything I have sent reviewed here.  I can tell you that it has plenty of storage for me.  I wanted access to  games at the Google play store that I could not get through Amazon.  Another reviewer here complained about there being not enough storage for games.  Not true for me.  Before purchasing this tablet I checked to see how much space and memory  was taken up by my on line activity and games.
It was much lower than the limit on this Samsung tablet so I bought it. Kindle Fire HD 7 is great as a reader.  The program within the reader has updated so it has most of the features I like so this is a win win purchase for me.",
"I bought a NEW Galaxy A tablet from Liz's High End Products. I couldn't be happier. The tablet came earlier than I expected! The delivety was by priority mail instead of standard delivery! The seller also included a FREE case!  Liz's High End Products can't be beat! The price was so reasonable. The tablet is excellent. Just the kind of tablet I've been researching. I'm  so impressed with the quality of this seller's products.  I've already ordered another tablet. I can't wait to get the new one!
I'm  now a loyal customer. I'm telling all my family and friends to check out
 Liz's High End Products. I'm searching the seller's  products right now. Christmas isn't that far away. Great items for great gifts. Thank you so much for surprising me with the FREE case. Excellent deals at excellent prices!
I'll be ordering  from this seller from now on!

"This order got lost in the mail and was refunded, but purchased another one.  My daughter and I absolutely love it!!!  We both have gone through two tablets each, so that's a total of four tablets,  and the longest one worked was about a year.  I can't afford to buy new tablets at this rate and decided to go with a top brand name and do my research and it paid off.  We both love this tablet so much that I bought a second one!  My daughter has download so many games on her tablet that I didn't think it was possible to have that many.  There have not been any issues with the tablets and we use them everyday. If you're looking for a new tablet look no further because this is it and I'd recommend it to anyone.  This is why I trust and love Samsung.",
"Had an ipad 3rd gen loaned to me for a few months. Thought it was the coolest thing. Pictures, music, youtube... everything. I had to replace it after it was returned. The old laptop just didn't do it for me anymore. Ipads are expensive I found out. Always liked Samsung products and the specs looked great so I crossed my fingers and ordered the Tab A. I don't know what others are doing with their tablets but for my needs this Samsung has it all over the ipad. It's thinner, lighter, less power hungry, has a durable great looking screen. It plays nice with my pc,  unlike the ipad. It also has direct data or file and folder accessability. Don't know what Apple was thinking. I think cheap, fast memory has made it moot.  Anyway, the point is,  I am very happy with my purchase.

This is my first",
"We purchased these Samsung Galaxy Tab A 8"" devices instead of laptops for all our social workers to use in the field with our clients and they absolutely love them. No one has had any problems or complaints. The tablet is lightweight and small enough to fit in their bags without taking up too much space, set up is a breeze, the screen quality is great, the processor fast enough for their needs, and multitasking between screens  has been flawless. This is an older model tablet that performs very well for the price. I liked the performance so much that I bought a Galaxy Tab S2 for myself that I am completely in love with. Our company will definitely be purchasing more of these budget friendly Samsung Tab A's as our staff increases.",
"I got this item years ago and never had the time to review it. When it first came, I cannot lie it was something I've always wanted and I can use for things that my phone is too small for. Now with the added years and use, I can honestly say this item is only good for awhile and does start getting slow with wear and tear. I'd definitely would recommend this for someone looking for something to begin with.",
"This is a very nice tablet. I also have a Ipad Pro 9.7, and although the Pro's performance is better, for 119.00 dollars you can't beat it. Do yourself a favor, get the cover that is not included. I found the tablet to be fairly well made, however, if you drop it, I doubt it will survive. With the cover on, it has a sturdy feeling, and feels well protected. I wanted an Android platform, and though different from Apple, I found it very easy and works well with Google Play store. The price is very nice and does 90% of what the Apple Pro can do, at least for what I use it for. Mileage may vary for other users who use the Apple platform. I would recommend this tablet to anyone, it's 8 inch screen is nice, and the tablet runs Apps quickly. It also can use Cromecast, which is effective for videos.",
"I initially bought a All-New Fire Kindle HD 8 for a 7-year-old child but I was disappointed by the screen, which even at top brightness seemed too dim and whose speakers did not go very loud. I also didn't like that it was all Amazon-specific and did not include the Google Play store.

I decided to order this one instead (basically the same price as the 32GB no-special-offers Kindle) and I am so glad I did. This is a beautiful tablet, with great bright screen, powerful speakers and good battery life. It runs games, Skype video conferences, and everything else we tried without a problem. It does not feel at all like a budget device. The only disadvantage compared with the same-price Kindle is that it has less memory (16GB) , but it does take microSD cards, so I am not concerned about that.

We paired it with the BMOUO Samsung Galaxy Tab A 8.0 Kids Case, which is also excellent.",
"I bought this tablet last year, and it still works good as new.  It has proven to be extremely reliable, and as a college student, i recommend it because it comes with MS office built in, which comes in handy as a student. I've used this device to write essays, assemble power point presentations, and even used one note as scratch paper while doing algebra.  Its small, but not too small. Its powerful and reliable.  Its not as beefy as some of the other galaxy tabs, but you really get a good machine in a small package. It can even run pokemon go (if you have a phone with wifi hotspot with you as well). This device has given me an edge as a student due to its capabilities in relation to its size. It does everything a tablet should do.  If you're looking for a consistently reliable tablet for a fair price, this one fits the bill.",
"The tablet is everything that was claimed.  The unit is light weight and the screen is beautiful. The battery lasts a long time and recharges rapidly.  However I am transitioning from a Windows 10 based tablet and am new to the Android operating system.  I expected most things at the OS level to be different, but a computer is a computer and the underlying features should be more or less the same.  The Android documentation is simply awful.  In summary, the tablet is great and what I have been able to work out with Android has been successful without glitches or crashes, but if you don't already have Android experience think twice.  Five stars for the tablet, two stars for the operating system.",
Loved the tablet till it wouldn't charge consistently.  My wife has one also and she has had no problems with her unit.  I had to send it in for repair (on Dec 3) and still do not have it back (now Dec 26).  The repair was completed on 12/7.  We think it is lost in the repair facility because UPS has never received it.  Communication with Samsung Customer Service is not good.  They answer the phones and try to help but getting transferred to a supervisor who can actually do something is next to impossible.  My wife achieved this today after being on the phone for a total of over 2 hours and having been disconnected 3 times.  The 3rd customer service representative actually called her back and eventually transferred her to a supervisor.  We are supposed to hear something by the 28th the latest.  I will update when this is resolved.  Hopefully it is an isolated incident!,
"Overall: This Tablet was great for the price (getting 16 GB for this price, awesome). It works really well. The tablet speed is good, it battery last for a good amount of time and it doesn't take long charge. Like all of Samsung product, this product held up to its name. However, the only down side to this product would be the fact that sometime it would not charge or come on. If this happens, I would have to hold down on the power and the volume keys for about ten seconds and it would work again. I am not saying that this may happened to everyone or work  for everyone, but this was something that happen to me and the solution that works. I have this tablet for about a year and it  still works in tip top shape.",
"After my kindle died I wanted a tablet that will be used mainly for reading (including complex PDFs) with an episode of Netflix sprinkled in and for those purposes it's perfect!

The first thing that I wanted was a tablet that was larger than 7 inches (which this 8). My phone is about 6 inches right now and an inch more screen space wouldn't justify a new device purchase.

The next thing I wanted was a micro SD card slot...pretty obvious as to why. For reading I wanted a 4X3 aspect ratio, this is important because a lot of tablets are made to watch movies and such in 16X9 or 16X10. When put in portrait mode 4X3 gives you a wider screen to view text. I'm going to post photos to show how different reading types fit on the screen.

 Finally I wanted something that will last a while - especially since I love to read for hours on end. So far it's done everything flawlessly.",
"My first was underpowered, the second, not a main brand name, towards the end began glitching so often it an unfortunate, angrily frustrated end, and the last before this one was an Amazon model which - though I should have known better - was too much of a store front device. Returned it almost the same day and ordered this one the next.

Use this Samsung mainly as an e-reader and media remote for chromecast. The Youtube app while generally stable has recently begun to just stop for no reason when broadcasting to my TV, Vimeo won't run properly unless ou navigate from the video being looked at - again, this is a broadcast to TV issue - but otherwise so far every other app works well.

Don't really game with it but games I play run well enough on it.",
"I purchased this tablet for a 60th birthday gift for my future brother-in-law and so far so good!  Bought him a tablet so he could have the mobility in and around his house, and not have to be stuck at his desktop PC all the time. He's been using it for about a week now and has enjoyed it so far. This is his first tablet and he has been able to figure things out on his own.  He's accessed the Internet, figured out to get to the Google Play Store to download apps, has actually downloaded and used some game apps, and taken pictures with it so far.  He's enjoyed the learning process and the mobility of having a tablet.  Now he's able to sit outside on the deck and play Sudoku!  Hope this helps!  Will provide another update in a few weeks. If you have found my review helpful, please indicate below.",
"I love this tablet! It`s just  what I needed. First of all, I needed something portable that allowed me to use office. This is perfect. It is OTG enabled, so with an adapter, I can use a mouse and a keyboard. I can also plug in a printer and print right from the tablet.  It is also great for watching Netflix, YouTube and surfing the web. The speed and resolution are  not going to superwow you, put they are  pretty decent.
I have owned the tab 3 and the tab 4 and this is a very good update.
It is a beautiful device, looks very nice and sleek.  I'm glad I went with the 8 inch model, because it's a perfect size and compact enough to carry in my purse with no bulk.

I've been using it for about three weeks and so far no complaints!",
"It's an okay tablet.  The newer android version means you can't do things with an SD card that you used to be able to.  The fact that there's pre-installed MS apps:  If you need them, great.  If like me you don't need them?  You can force stop/disable, but there is no way to uninstall them.  that means there's apps taking up a lot of room when added together.  Have just a few apps I d/l, nothing fancy or super huge.  But since you can't move apps, etc. to an SD card (bought with - don't even know if it works!) you're looking at using up a good chunk of the 16Gb this tablet comes with.

Screen is nice and clear, easy to hold, fast enough.  The camera (I know, tablet cameras usually aren't super) is terrible imho and I'm talking about the back camera.  Also do not like where the back camera is.  It's just not serving the purpose I bought it for at all.  Very disappointed with Samsung and this tablet.  I don't buy things often and when I do, I don't buy something to be completely frustrated by it.  Will be returning and guess for now I'll just stay with my Samsung Tab Pro 8.4 even though it's far behind the current android version.  It's not like I'm doing anything sensitive on it.",
"I bought two of these 8"" tablets for my kids, and they absolutely love them. They are the perfect size (a child doesn't need a huge display, but 8"" is still pretty big!), a perfect balance of features, and run very well everything they do and play on them. The 16 GB internal flash drive is more than enough for dozens of games they keep stuff in their device, and even better - I could add another SD card (I added 32 GB) for storing things like photos and movies and leave the 16 GB just for apps. A welcome surprise is that unlike many other devices, this one supports out of the box dozens of languages (including the one I cared about, Hebrew).
I really recommend getting with this tablet also this cover, which protects the tablet from all directions (including the screen), and makes it easy to turn the table on and off just by flipping the cover:",
"I was looking for a tablet or reader for travel. After doing a bunch of comparisons, it came down to the Amazon Paperwhite, Kindle HD 8"", or the Samsung Tab A 8.0 (I really wanted the Samsung S2 or S3, but couldn't justify the cost). The Paperwhite screen was only 6"", which was too small for me. So, the Kindle vs Tab A. I finally decided that I didn't want to lock myself into the Amazon ecosystem, so I chose the Tab A.

So far, I'm loving it. Perfect size for reading (about the size of a hardback book, definitely bigger than a paperback). I downloaded the Netflix app. Yes, I prefer a bigger screen, but it's perfect for an occasional flight in a cramped seat. My MP3 files sound great, and all of my reading apps run flawlessly. The only wart is that the Tab A 8.0 only has one speaker, so the only way to get stereo sound is via external speakers or ear buds. No biggie, since I bought this for its portability.

All in all  I couldn't be happier.",
"Fed up replacing the ""Fire"" for the 5th time (literally) due to faulty charging ports, i finally got smart and looked for a suitable replacement . Here she is

After weeks of searching, reading reviews, comparing prices, pros and cons, i decided on the Galaxy 8 and couldn't be happier.

The tablet(s) are for my toddlers. The Galaxy is a bit more expensive than the Fire, but this is a case of you get what you pay for. I would have saved hundreds had i just bought this from the start.

The Fire has an approx 4 month shelf life with daily use, this has surpassed that and is still going strong. The tablet is quick, not filled with bloat, has withstood 2 - 4 year olds (with the kids case) and easy to use. I would actually get one for myself if i was a tablet user

If you're looking to invest in a decent tablet that is isn't too expensive, turtle slow and will last you, this is a pretty good option",
"I absolutely love this tablet! I mainly use it to check social media and read ebooks, and I find it to be a perfect size for reading. The design is sleek, thin, and the smoky titanium is aesthetically pleasing. I know I can take this with me anywhere, and the battery life is solid. So far I've been able to get two days of use on a single charge.

Performance wise, this tablet is very fast and responsive. It's basically a bigger version of my galaxy phone, which I love. The storage space is a little small, but thankfully there's an sd slot to make up for that. The only weird thing I've run into is it had me go through 3 or 4 software updates when I first got it, so it could upgrade to the latest version of android. For me this wasn't a problem, just a little annoying to deal with upon first using it. For the price this is a very high quality product, and I would recommend it to anyone!

Pros: lightweight, beautiful display, very responsive touchscreen, good battery life, google apps, sleek look, fast performance
Cons: small storage space of only 16gb",
"So far, for the price, I'm loving it. It's a gift for my 5 year old son because his Tab 3 Kids Edition is going to his younger sister. So far, I've installed all his favorite apps (even ones he ran out of room for on his old tablet), and I've got room for more. I added a 64GB microSD card, and told Google Play to load all movies on the card (AWESOME!!!! Saves soooo much space). I've also got VUDU installed doing the same... in total, I've added about 10 HD movies to his tablet all without taking up space from the precious 16GB RAM. [if you're wondering, the movies from Google Play are mainly Disney Movies Anywhere digital copies, and VUDU has the remaining UltraViolet digital copies).  All of them look fantastic on his tab (really, the relatively low screen resolution is NOT a problem whatsoever, for him and for most adults). He's not going to be looking and working with tiny fonts where he'll notice the tiny jaggies.
Now I just need a bit more time to see how its performance holds up with his games and general usage, and how sturdy it is in his case.",
"I bought this tablet to replace an older Acer tablet. The product is well built. I particularly like the 4:3 format for viewing Web pages. I seldom watch videos on a tablet so that was also a factor in selecting the 4:3 format and the lower resolution of the Tab A vs the higher end Samsung tablets. The touch screen has a nice feel and is very responsive. I also like the magnetic sensor that places the tablet in sleep mode when using a case that has this feature. I have used 7 inch tablets and find them too small. Trying 10 inch tablets in stores I have found them to be a bit cumbersome and heavy for casual use and travel. The 8 inch size of this tablet is perfect for our use. It is near us at all times for quick Web browsing and reading email. The tablet comes with Microsoft Office, but I rarely use it on the tablet. I find that these programs are much better on a desktop or laptop computer. All in all this tablet is perfect for our needs and I would recommend it anybody looking for a tablet they are using it for casual browsing and reading email.",
"I've had this tablet four days and I've been experiencing a lot of issues with it. First of all the screen was a huge turn off when I just received it and took my eyes a few days to get accustomed to it. Secondly the performance is very poor! Apps crashes and freezes a lot and the device itself is very slow. I bought a 128gb SD card and my memory is still full...…i have to constantly delete apps or reload to the memory card. I am very disappointed because I've read mostly positive reviews about this tablet. This is also my second tablet after having to return the first one after only 2 days. Samsung needs to do a software update fast!

Update: I've  now had this tablet almost 2 weeks and the performance has improve a lot since my first post. I changed the interface  from touchwiz to something else and it made a world of difference. I am now really enjoying everything about my tablet.....and as of now I have no regrets. I've fallen in love with this tablet.",
"4 YEARS LATER... I have decided to upgrade to a new tab. This tab never died. It simply lived its full life.
First the display is not gonna compare to the flagship devices. You can see the pixels if you're looking for them. The audio quality is passable at best. The cameras also are passable.

Ok. Once I accepted those ""cons"" it performs fine under my standards. The UI is virtually identical to the high dollar units. It has ran without issue any Play Store app I've tried. I'm not a mobile gamer so I'm not sure on that. The device quality as far as material is good. Feels the same as the flagship. Looks clean and elegant. Has the micro SD slot! I don't feel left behind by the higher devices. This device suits my needs. I watch Netflix, YT, and any vid I try. Use Google calendar, message apps, social media, pay bills etc... My eyes adjusted to the screen so I don't notice the flaws and it's plenty bright. Bottom line: I saved $200+ and sacrificed very little. Im off the ""flagship"" bandwagon. Keeping up with the Joneses isn't worth it.",
"So far, so good, although I have added a Rhino guard because I am clumsy and now it barely fits in the Amazon Basics sleeve I originally ordered with it. If you tend to armor your electronics as I do you might want to shop around for something just a bit larger, but that's the Basics case, not the Tablet. Android 5 autocorrect is very aggressive and not very smart, so be careful if you're in email or on Spacebook before you've finished a cup of coffee. I had returned a Kit Kat tablet because I need to space on my external SD. Win. I actually travelled to Europe with a tablet and Bluetooth keyboard for a month's study, and so far this one is holding up very well as my portable word processor as well. Last, watched a movie with my girlfriend using the keyboard stand (before the Rhino case came). Very sharp picture without viewing angle issues, and exceptional sound, and less than 30% battery depletion for a two hour film on Netflix. I haven't watched anything since putting it in the Rhino, and I hope that doesn't disrupt the excellence of the volume and clarity of the sound. Overall, if you need or want a smaller tablet, are generally happy with the Samsung brand (as I am), this is the tablet for you.",
"It's OK runs well so far, it's still new so time will tell as these products seem to deteriorate over time. It is somewhat fast thus far and handles all apps pretty well. One issue I am running to a lot is Apps in the google store give me the error 'may not be optimized for this device"" about 80% of the time. Seems rather odd. Supposed to be with Android 5 but was delivered with Android 6. Upon starting is immediately began an update and now it is running Android 7.1.1. Perhaps that might be the issue with the apps. it also is confused about the ""home page"" because ALL apps I install say it is ""adding short cut to the home page"" but actually it is adding it to the page just to the right of the home page, and YES, I know where my home page is. Screen is very clear and it reads books really well with ZERO pixelation. I am finding it is much easier to use it in landscape mode but I am constantly clicking back button and multiple page button over and over again. It's also very easy the click the apps on the bottom row by accident as well......I am for ever opening up the camera by accident. I hate the position of the rear camera...when in landscape and trying to take a picture my fingers always get in the way of the lense due to its poor placement. Si I have to hold it by the very edge so as not to block the lense and that makes it a bit difficult to hold it steady and secure. Pictures are OK for the price I paid but the camera does not do well in poor or low lighting. I also am finding that the touch screen is somewhat sporadic. Some times while online it takes multiple taps in order for it to register. I don't know how many camera shots I have lost due to the fact that it wasn't registering my taps on the button. My biggest downer about this thus far is the speaker placement. In portrait it is on the bottom left and in landscape it is on the bottom right, right where my hand is. Super poor placement IMO. Overall, for the price I paid for it I am somewhat happy but I just have to get used to the things I don't like about it.",
"Had this now for about a week. My previous tablet was a ipad gen 4 which has a 10"" screen.
Bare in mind this is the mid grade tablet from Samsung. And you won't be disappointed; this product suits my needs but only just.
The screen clarity leaves a little to be desired for. And the speed is bare minimum for my Internet browsing and mild game playing. I understand this could be in part due to Internet speeds but is a bit slow on noninternet based applications as well.
But going from 10"" screen to 8"" has been pretty painless for me. My old Ipad usually got left behind at home or in the car when out and about due to size and weight.

Pros:
  Weight and size make the travel and Daly use friends
  Does everything I need it to do
  Battery life is quite good
  I feel the 8"" screen size is perfect to accomplish most everything
Cons:
  A little slow
  Medium quality graphics or screen quality

I'm not a super tech guy so excuse me If I used the wrong terminology above.",
"Works great!Specially satisfied with the new android update.It's good for gaming experience but not all games work perfectly.Some lag a bit but other than that it's good for the ones on the middle range and it's a good time killer for those who need one.The battery is pretty good.It lasts at least a day with full charge of gaming with taking breaks.I calculated about 5 percent for half an hour of playing..but of course it also depends on the game itself.The battery charges for 'bout 4 to 5 hours which isn't all that great but for this price and the quality you're getting i believe it's worth the buck.
I'm very satisfied with the display.Very bright and pronoun colors.I was in a dilemma between this and the Tab E 9'6 but when i watched a comparison video i got infatuated.Put on something colorful on that lock screen and watch the magic.
Only negative i can say is that i received the wrong power brick.We don't use the same kind in most of Europe.

P.S I forgot to mention that the sound speaker is in a pretty bad place.Like when you use the accelometer in racing games i keep blocking it with my hand.Not an issue if you put on a pair headphones though.",
"After a week of usage I love this little tablet. I have been using iPads since they were initially released and have had a few. This one blows them right out of the water. The battery life is amazing. I fully charged the device when I got it and ran it through some tests. Streaming video from Netflix for 8 consecutive hours took the battery from 100% to 72% Side by side with my 4th generation iPad doing the same test the battery on the iPad drained to 15%. Yes, I'm sure the battery being new has something to do with it. but impressive nonetheless.

I setup the kids mode and allow my 4 year old son to play with it. He loves it and the kids mode allows him to play without any worry of accidental purchases, or getting into something he shouldn't.

Also the added free software they include is quite nice. The full MS Office suite comes pre-loaded which is surprisingly nice to have. I deal with a lot of Spreadsheets for work and it has allowed me to keep my laptop in my bag and handle things from the tablet.

I expanded the memory with a 128 GB micro SD. For the same amount of storage with the iPad it would cost more then buying 3 of these.

All that being said, The screen is not as sharp as I would like. But if that's not a big deal to you this thing is a winner.

I feel confident in making a recommendation for this product, and plan on buying one for my parents and siblings this Christmas.",
"Before I begin you should know we have only had this for a day so far. BUT I LOVE IT!

This was actually bought for my son (I use it also). We originally bought a kids Amazon fire and that was a huge disappointment. I didn't want to pay the amount of money they asked for an iPad so I asked multiple people and did tons of research and everything pointed to this tablet!

It took me a little while to figure out since I have never owned any Samsung products, but I'm talking 10 minutes at most. It's still set up very similarly to Apple products.

This tablet runs great, super fast, which was the main problem with the fire. This one also offers everything I was looking for.
Most parents want the ""kids time"" stuff with apps for their kids, which I believe there is an app for that on here, but I didn't. I wanted to download netflix, kids YouTube, learning apps, Disney jr, etc. That way my son could choose between what he wanted to do easily. The apps that came on here like chrome and mail and such I just moved 4 pages over and he has no idea they are there! I have my apps over there also ;)
The other great thing about this tablet is the battery life! It doesn't take long to charge and the battery actually lasts!

I'm extremely impressed with this tablet, it is definitely worth the money!
I 100% recommend this for a child or adult!",
"Being a technophobe (a lady of a certain age without a smart phone), I bought this tablet to keep up with e-mail while on a three-week trip on which I didn't want to haul my laptop.  I couldn't possibly have set up the tablet myself, and in fact, it took my very savvy computer guru several hours to set it up and to teach me how to do basic things on it.  So I suppose I would have to say that it isn't ideal for the novice or the faint of heart.  But I'm sure that once I have a chance to practice and experiment with it, I will grow to be less cautious and terrified of it.  There is much to be liked about it, but the one thing I find both frustrating and annoying is that in writing e-mails, it anticipates the words being typed and as often as not gets them wrong, but types them anyhow, necessitating constant retyping and attentive re-reading of one's messages before clicking ""send.""  I would have preferred spell-check to this anticipatory feature, which rather than speeding up the composition of a message, actually slows it down considerably.  I've not yet experimented with the tablet's many capabilities and features, including the camera, which I have been told is excellent.  I also have not added any apps.  So this review must be considered somewhat premature and a work-in-progress.",
"I just purchased this tablet, and I am in love!!! I did a lot of research on tablets, and I was looking for one that had the ability to transfer apps to the SD card. There were many that said they could, but when I did further research, they actually could not, so don’t be fooled. The screen size on this tablet was 8”, and I am used to using a 7” screen, but I am now a HUGE fan of the 8” screen this one has. The processer was 1.5 GB ram, and it runs so fast and smooth. I got a 16 GB and added a 16 GB SD card, and I have tons of room. We also have a nexus 7 tablet, and I was looking for something comparable to that, and this one did, and exceeded my expectations. The nexus 7 does not allow an SD card, so this is an upgrade from that tablet for sure.  Also, I am huge into the online game apps, and I have installed 13 of my game apps on it, in addition to many other apps within the first week, with no problems at all. I have so much room on it, it is amazing. I have read many reviews that say the screen quality on this particular tablet was not good, and I have found that to be false in my opinion. This tablet came with the home charger, which was something some other tablets I reviewed did not all come with. I would recommend this tablet to anyone looking for a fast, high capacity tablet that is not so expensive that you have to mortgage your house to own one.",
"Easy to navigate.  Good response time.  Received new on 12/31/2017 with 60% charge - user manual advises that charging should be done before first use.  Time to charge was about as user manual explains - 4 hours to charge if fully discharged.  So, it took about 1 hour 35 minutes.  Easy to set up - not too many screens to go through and not difficult to figure out how to provide input to go on to next screens.  User manual misled me by its description of Microsoft Word being preloaded on the tablet.  After copying a Word document from a computer to this tablet, the document could not be opened - interface sought a network connection.  I thought that I would be able to at least view a Word document without a network connection.  Samsung customer service person informed me that at least for first use, tablet software will seek updates to Word, and therefore a network connection is needed.  After initial updates, I was informed that I should be able to work with Word documents without a network connection.  Found out 1/1/2018 that Ethernet network option is not available despite the user manual describing that it is.  Samsung customer service informed me that the Galaxy Tab A is not designed to work on an Ethernet network no matter what adapter is tried.  Internet search, that included discussions among tablet users did not find any assurances of tablet use with any Ethernet adapters.,",
"About a year ago I bought a Samsung Galaxy 7 tablet for my son as a Christmas gift, but never had a lot of interest in buying one for myself, seeing I owned a Kindle Fire.  Even though he is disabled, my son loves his tablet and takes it most everywhere with him.  I have a Samsung Galaxy 5 cell phone, but it is a work phone and I am not allowed to load apps or anything to it.  Love the phone but not being able to do anything non-work related with it is frustrating.  So between my son's tablet and my phone, I have always been impressed with Samsung mobile type products.  A friend has a Samsung tablet and suggested I might find it easier to use and more beneficial than my Kindle.  I had always found the Kindle to be difficult to use except as a reader and for audible books and I have had it for several years now.  So I figured I would give a tablet a try and this Samsung seemed to fit the bill.  I am very impressed with it and now do everything I use to do with the Kindle plus a lot more.  Accessing email, using apps, shopping on Amazon, plus syncing it with my Kindle and Audible books, is a lot better than my Kindle.  So the Kindle will gather dust or I will give it to a friend.  BTW - I don't get the cheap looking comments on this tablet.  Not so in my opinion and I have a nice case for it, so not sure what folks are referring to in that regard.  Very nice tablet for this first time tablet owner.",
"This tablet arrived today so it is a little early for a full review, but I will review anyway.  I was looking for a lightweight, fast, and reliable Android table for under $300. This one definitely exceeds my expectations (and at a great price). My husband has a new ipad (not air) that I think its too bulky. Also, I don't love iOS and am not a fan of itunes.  So Apple was out for me.  I was worried Samsung would add too many layers on top of the pure Android experience, but Lollipop (it upgraded already!) seems to have minimal overt Samsung modifications (at least none that bother me).

I am not a heavy video consumer but the few videos I did watch (you tube) looked great to me.
Strongly recommend this table at this price point!

Update:
I've had it for a few days and still love a lot about it.  What I don't love: even though I don't watch a lot of video content, the resolution difference between this tablet and my phone is enormous.  I didn't think it would matter to me -- but it does.  I like reading websites on my phone better, which defeats one of the purposes of this tablet. Also, the touch screen isn't always as responsive as I'm used to.  I haven't seen anyone else mention this in the Tab A, so maybe it is just this device. I also get a lag sometimes that I never get on my Moto X (phone).  I'm leaning toward returning it right now even though I still think it is a great tablet otherwise.  Changed from 5 to 4 stars.",
Got this tablet as a Christmas gift.  Have had iPads & phones for a number of years so hard to rate an android like I do apple.  I do like the tablet and can do pretty much what our apples do.  The main thing I may be unhappy with is not being able to move some of the apps to the SD card.  I don't go app crazy so I only have a few apps but I'm disappointed that some won't move to the external SD card and it seems like the 16 GB memory is filling up fast.  Haven't checked user guide to see if there are more options to free up space once the internal storage is full but could be I can uninstall a lot of pre-loaded apps that I won't use. Galaxy has a great reputation and I do like the chance to learn about android since my wife has an android tablet.  Because it's not like iOS it takes a while to accomplish what we want but so far have muddled my way through things.  I have also heard because android is a user based OS that it is easier to hack. Also read that sometimes moving apps or some things from 1 android OS to another may not work.  The tablet seems to run slower than apples and at times it seems like it locks up.  I'm  sure if you're an android fan the tablet would rate 5 stars.  I gave it 4 because the cost of the android is more reasonable than apple.  Hope this is helpful.,
"I got this as a gift when my old Tab 3 died on me, and I'm happy that I did. The larger sized screen on this one (8 as opposed to my old one being 7) makes typing a lot easier. The screen is also very crisp and clear and I have no problem with the resolution as other reviewers complained about.

Pros:
Beautiful, clear screen

The colors on everything are nice

Apps load and run quickly and play perfectly

The speeds of things (for the most part, see my 'cons' list) are really fast

The split screen feature seems nice, but I only used it once and I don't need it really

The tablet itself is pretty lightweight and comfortable

The rear camera is REALLY nice, the auto-focus is great, and it takes very clear nice photos in the daytime. Nighttime photos varies depending on the amount of lighting

Cons:
Browser & Youtube speeds - I find that Chrome crawls and loads pages slowly, even mobile versions. Often I wait quite a long time for something to load on a page, or the youtube app will show the spinning wheel for quite some time. I didn't have this issue with the older Tab 3 with browsing, but I did with Youtube so perhaps it's an issue with Youtube's app? Either way, browser speeds were sluggish.

Fingerprints show up BIG TIME on the glass. The first time I used it and put it down I could see every detail of where my fingers had been.

The front facing camera is awful in every lighting. I found myself trying to awkwardly take pictures with the back camera instead of the front because the front one is just bad. I'm also really not feeling the facial beauty thing it does on self photos and I haven't found a way to turn it off yet. It also doesn't appear to have the auto focus the rear camera does.",
"I have been an Apple iPad purist for years. When I recently gave my mother my iPad Mini (she is having some issues with her vision and it's easier for her to use for certain apps than her phone), I thought I'd be content with just having my Pro 9.7. However, I like to read in bed, and the larger iPad really doesn't work well for that. I considered a Kindle Paperwhite, but since the Paperwhite doesn't reverse to a black field with white text I didn't want to use that and needed something for which I could use the Kindle app.

I decided to try an Android tablet, which would be significantly less expensive than a new Mini 4. Plus, I'd been wanting to get experience with Android because I have friends who have Android phones who are always asking me questions about them for which I have no answer. After doing a bit of research, I decided on the Galaxy Tab A 8-inch, which was almost exactly the same size as the Mini. Several local stores had good sales but nobody ... and I mean NOBODY ... had one in stock. They had plenty of the 7"" tablets but with the smaller size and only 8GB of memory, even with the SD expansion slot, I wasn't interested. So I ordered it here.

I am very pleased with this device. It was easy to set up and it's been responsive and intuitive to use. The size and form factor are nearly identical to my old Mini. If anything I like the Kindle app better on the Android than on the iPad -- not the least of which is because you can buy Kindle books directly from the Android app and not from the Apple one (has to do with Apple demanding 30% of all sales on the iPad, which includes Kindle books. Can't say I blame Amazon for not wanting part of that ""deal"").

I only have one minor complaint and not a large enough one to warrant a loss of a star -- you can't turn down the ambient light on the Galaxy as far as you can with the Mini. This only becomes an issue because I tend to stay up later than my husband so when I am reading he is trying to sleep, and it seems like I can't get the screen as dark as my Mini could go. Curiously, he says the ambient light it throws seems to be less overall and it doesn't bother him at all. Maybe it projects less overall but it seems brighter to me.",
These devices works great and are a nice size. I bought two of them.,
"Update 4/2/2016: BUYER BEWARE: While I am still happy with this tablet, I purchased this as an Open Box item from Amazon's Warehouse. I have purchased other products from them, was really happy at the ""deals"" I got, and got them covered with an extended warranty through Square Trade. It occurred to me I hadn't covered this tablet and tried to do so. After jumping through a ton of hoops, I was informed Amazon changed its policy and no longer offers Square Trade warranties for Amazon Warehouse. The other two warranty suggestions I received got so many horrible reviews from users, I wondered why these were even available at Amazon.

To add insult to injury, I purchased a lovely case to protect this beautiful tablet, set it down on the window sill and it slipped off and cracked ... in the case! Ugh! Thank goodness I bought it with my American Express card, which protects purchases (including drops) in the first 90days. That said, please keep in mind that Amazon will NOT help you with quality warranties on Warehouse merchandise AND, not for nothing, but I'm a little unhappy that the tablet is so ""fragile"" (?) that the screen cracks so easily, and very unhappy that the cover offered such little protection. I am very careful with my things & often have them for YEARS, so I am a bit disappointed in the fragility of this product.

Original review: I am very happy with the Samsung tablet. I have watched more than  a few on demand videos now and don't understand the criticism of picture/screen quality - it's beautiful. I have the 8"" Tab A and couldn't be happier with my decision. I charged it fully when I got it on Sunday (!); today is Friday and I am only now charging it again. Mind you, the battery was at about 46%. Incredibly decent. And during that time, I watched about 3 hours of video content, checked email daily and left WiFi on. My cover puts the tablet to sleep when closed and wakes it up when opened, so it has not been shut down in six days. I have access to all the apps I could need and LOVE that it comes loaded with Microsoft Office - giving me access to Word, Excel  and Power Point.  I don't know how well the camera and video work yet but will update if something is amis. I had this on my Wish list and kept an eye for a deal. I spotted one in the Amazon Warehouse, listed in very good condition for $151.00 vs. $195.00. I would say it is BRAND new and cannot imagine email you could see a difference! Outstanding. The tablet was still in the cellophane with plugs and cords. Very pleased and would definitely recommend AND buy again.",
"First, many thanks to Amazon! Outstanding service, as always!
Samsung Galaxy Tab A 8"" Tablet. I purchased it because my 4"" Galaxy Player has a very old version of Android: 2.3.5. Therefore some of my beloved applications start disappearing because their creators upgraded them for a higher Android version. So sad. My little player was and still is the best hardware there is with all the bells and whistles that many of the new tablets can't match today.
So, my experience with Samsung's tablet:
8"" is too big for my little hands. Holding it to read a book or the news with one hand is a pain. Try both hands, and you'll find your fingers on the screen, which, normally will make the tablet to respond to some commands and switch the screens, open up other apps...and so forth. And I have the continuous sensation that the tablet wants to slip an fall all the time.
Another annoying feature is the screen brightness. Yes, I did try to set it up from Auto On/Off. In the dark, at night, it darkens. In the daylight, brightens. Very strange way of acting and totally stubborn despite the settings. Missing a + and - for manually adjusting it. (Because in the top front of screen there is a sensor that watches you and adjust the brightness of the screen based on if thinks you are looking at it or not? how maddening is that? The tablet knows better what you need? How hard is to push a + or a -  /setting ????
The most annoying issue is on how the Marshmallow, 6.0 is distorting the resolution on some applications. Didn't they learned that when upgrading to a new OS version, the video capacity of the computers(tablets) is to be considered?
All my beloved puzzle games are not plastered on an 8"" screen, they look like a tank rolled over them, if you ever booted your Windows OS in Safe Mode, you know what I see here.
The tablet came with the Lollypop, but once you unpack it, set it up and connect it online, it automatically updates, upgrades and so on.
So, in 5 minutes from connecting I had the Marshmallow, 6.01. (btw, fabulous fast connectivity and speed from my unlocked T-Mobile WiFi hotspot device).
I am sick and tired being used by Microsoft over the years of being an unpaid - but - paying tester of their OS. It seems that Google is now doing the same.
However, looking at it, the tablet is very attractive, and I won't contest most buyers here are satisfied. And congratulations to all! Overall, it is a good buy. Samsung and Amazon are both in my heart.
But based on my personal inability to handle the device (hands too small) I have to return it, and I am really sorry.
If anyone returns it, please don't forget: Delete the Google account you created in the tablet (not your gmail account!), then reset it to the factory settings before returning it. Because that's the nice thing to do.",
"The missing stars are 1) on one side for the bloatware Samsung packs on this tablet. I don't care about or can download myself if I want to: Skype, Netflix, Word, Excel, PowerPoint and some more. Why is it most manufacturers believe this will help? I would be better to let the owner decide. 2) Anothe other reason I took a star away is Lollipop 5.02... Really..? On 2016...? Lollipop (Android 5 was released on 2014). Yes, I know Samsung promised Lollipop for the Tab A... but when...? 2018..? This is now a ONE YEAR OLD tablet, that came with an ALREADY OLD ANDROID VERSION and STILL HAS NO UPDATE TO MARSHMALLOW, so I've stopped dreaming about ""N"". Next tablet will be a Nexus. No doubt about it!

Felt good to let that out of my system. Now, on the good side, the 4:3 format is just great, and the 8 inches is like the perfect size. I come from a Tab 2 7.0 oldie and I prefer tablets I can hold on one hand. For the record: I use the tablet for study during the day and some reading on the bed.

Finally, the original Samsung clamp is also great. It holds to the Tab A with a special lock the Tab has, and looks nice! It has a reasonbale price.",
"Works great! for about a 100$ it does what I needed it to and is the perfect size to fit in my purse. So far Ive owned 3/4 different tablets: a small ""phablet"", this one (8""), a 10"" nexus, and the surface pro 4. Of the 4 tablets, I like this size the best.  The phablet I found was too big and awkward to comfortably fit in my pockets, but small enough that reading books or watching tv was a bit uncomfortable on the eyes.  By contrast the 10"" nexus and surface pro 4 (which I use for work primarily) are to large to fit in my mid size purses.  This size can fit in nearly every one of my bags ( the only exception being my small clutches and evening bags).

 It works quickly, and I havent had any issues with it overheating. It is a bit of a slow charger, and if your are using the tablet with the screen on full brightness, it will drain the battery faster then it will charge. I did find however, that so long as you have the brightness set to the lowest level, it will (slowly) charge at a rate of about 1% increase per 10 minutes.  In normal conditions, if I am not charging and using simultaneously, it takes a couple hours to fully charge.

The blue smoke color is beautiful.  I bought a cheap (like 6$) case for my tablet to protect since it does get tossed about in my purse.",
"This was and still is my first tablet. I've enjoyed using it since I got it fully charged and connected. The battery lasts forever and it has lots of space for games, apps, and pictures. I've downloaded word processing apps to it and  several games and apps and it isn't even close to its memory. The screen is clear and bright. The touch screen is responsive and it lightweight and thin. You can use a stylus with it, but it doesn't have a pen. Good sound quality and updates are reasonable. I'd get a newer model of the Tab because I had a good experience with this one.",
"The resolution specs & some of the reviews kept me from buying this initially...and so I went chasing pixels and bought the new Tab A 7.0 as a Mother's Day present for my wife to replace her Tab 3 7.0. Skipping to the punch line, the 7.0 went back to Amazon the next day and I got the Tab A 8.0 the day after that. My wife loves it. Resolution? Pixels? Processor? Android Version? My wife couldn't care less. The 4:3 display is bright and colorful & the tablet is fast.

Would I have bought it for myself? No. I bought the 8.0 Tab S2 6 months ago because I buy the best electronics products I can afford regardless of the price/performance ratios. This is no knock on the S2...I would make the same decision again today. The 320 ppi AMOLED display is gorgeous and it is fast...but really no faster than the A 8.0 for the way my wife uses her tablet. Why? The S2 needs the Quad Core processors and the higher performance GPU to push everything out on to that beautiful screen. The processor on the Tab A has a lot less work to do and it does it remarkably well...especially for a $169 tablet. Can I tell the difference when I put this tablet and my S2 side by side? You bet...but in this case that was quite beside the point.

So consider the user's needs and/or check the tablet out yourself before dismissing it because of the specs.",
"SAMSUNG GALAXY TAB A 8-INCH TABLET

I am very late getting into the world of tablets and such, but for Mother's Day my husband purchased this tablet for me.  I love playing the game WORDS WITH FRIENDS.  I was playing through my computer, through FACEBOOK.  The game moved so slowly, pop-up commercials were a constant, the board would freeze, and all of this would cut into my game production time.  Plus, it was very frustrating to sit and wait while a letter slowly went from the bottom of the board to where I wanted to place it!  And, really, I have ZERO patience!

My husband got me this SAMSUNG tablet and I could not be happier with it.  I am able to be on FACEBOOK, play WORDS WITH FRIENDS, check my email, play other games, plus there are many other features that I have yet to dive into.  The tablet fits nicely in my hands.  It also comes with a stylus. There is also a charger included  The tablet charges quickly and holds the charge for my entire day.  We purchased a screen protector and cover separately for my tablet.  It is sleek and cool and wonderful.

I am a technology challenged person, but seem to be able to muddle through this tablet and its many functions nicely.  I can honestly highly recommend this unit to you.  Me?  I LOVE mine!",
"I own both the models of Galaxy Tab A 9.7 and 8.0  in our household and the Tab A 8.0 is the one I use personally all them time mainly because of its compact size which is great for one handed use and a sharper screen . I purchased the Tab A 8.0 after deliberating considerably whether to go for the Tab A 8.0 or the newer Tab E . In the end I choose the Tab A because if felt much more premium in hands compared to the Tab E.  Here's how I feel these both the Tab A 9.7 & 8.0  tablets stack up against each other if you're considering either of the two :

BUILD QUALITY
- Both the  tablets are made of plastic with a metallic frame that runs around its sides. Despite its plastic construction these tablets do not feel cheap in any way ( The newer Tab E in comparison feels cheaper) with its soft touch matte finish plastic
- The color choices on the tablet is great , having owned both the White & 'Smoky Titanium' colors - you cant go wrong with either of them . The white color is a nice soft metallic white with a slight pearl effect and the 'Smoky Titanium' is more of a metallic gunmetal shade - a good departure of the standard solid whites ,greys or blacks found on most other tablets

FEATURES & PERFORMANCE
- Both the Tab A 8.0 & 9.7 feature the same Qualcomm SnapDragon 410 processor - A mid range quad core 64 Bit 1.2 Ghz processor released in 2014
- Both the 8.0"" and 9.7"" scored pretty similarly on the AnTuTu synthetic benchmark owing to their similar hardware specifications (see pics)
- Both 9.7"" and 8.0"" tablets feature screens with 768 X 1024 resolution which gives them a pixel density ( higher values mean sharper images & text) of 160 PPI for the 8.0"" model and 132 PPI on the 9.7"" model
- The 160 PPI pixel density on the 8.0"" is adequate for most uses , including browsing text heavy websites like Wikipedia , without having to zoom in too much. The pixelation is much more noticeable on the 9.7"" model
- The screen colors are rich and vibrant with good viewing angles
- The 8.0"" tab features a 4200 mAh battery which is good for 1.5 days of heavy use , the only issue here is it charges rather slowly at max of 1A as compared to the max charging current of 2A on the 9."" model
- In terms of performance , it can easily handle about 3 simultaneous tabs in the chrome browser after which the limitations & slowdowns due to its 1.5GB RAM become apparent (Both models have 1.5GB RAM)
- The single speaker at the bottom of the 8.0"" model is pretty weak and you would usually have to turn up the volume above 75% to hear anything clearly (as opposed to better dual stereo speakers on the 9.7"" model)
- The tablet does have an expandable MircoSD card slot which is great

THE GOOD
- The 8.0 model has a rich and vibrant screen with good viewing angles and sufficient resolution for everyday use
- Touchscreen sensitivity and fluidity is great with not stuttery UI performance
- The 8.0 screen size is ideal for one handed use , yet offer enough real estate for media consumption like pictures or videos.
- The tablet performance is more than adequate, I had no issues running 1080P movies on the Netflix app , browsing with 3-4 tabs open or playing light games like Temple Run, Subway Surfer etc
- I absolutely love Samsung's implementation of  multi-tasking which allows you to run two compatible apps side by side in windowed form . This is one feature , which once you get used to, you will be using very often
- Expandable storage
- Its upgraded to the latest Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow OS

THE NOT SO GOOD
- Weak single speaker
- the 5MP rear and 2MP front camera's are not that great, though they are sufficient for video chatting
- Average battery life of 1.5 days and very slow charging speeds at 1A
- For these reasons I take away one star

FINAL THOUGHTS
Overall I really like the Tab A 8.0 (over our Tab A 9.7) and can highly recommend it to you as you get a great form factor , decent screen resolution and performance with bright vivid colors and expandable storage all for under a $150 price tag. In fact i still choose this tablet over heavily discounted Ipad Mini during Black Friday 2016 as I felt it fulfilled my requirements sufficiently and gave more bang for my buck",
"I have been using this tablet pretty heavily since I got it about 4 months ago. I am a college student as well as an entrepreneur, and I use this device for school work, working on my online store, and for some apps and games that are just entertainment. pro's and con's below:

Pros:
- The major selling point for me was microsoft office. To be able to use word and excel while away from my house without my lugging around my laptop is a pretty big deal for me. I got a keyboard case to go with it of course, but that isn't relevant to this review

-It is fast, I can run multiple apps all day long with no problems at all. searching the web, making documents, playing games are all flawlessly quick.

-Battery life, Did I mention I use this all day? No problems with the battery so far. I just make sure I charge it every night and there are no problems all day long. on the off chance I do forget I plug it in while I am doing something else and it charges reasonably quickly.

-Look and feel. This is a pretty decently built device. It doesn't look or feel cheap. Also the size (8 inch) is perfect.

-Screen clarity and resolution. The screen resolution is the one complaint I have seen on here, but I honestly don't know why. It looks good, and for all of the things I use it for, it is perfect. Sure this isn't an ultra high definition screen, but so what? To each their own I suppose.

Con's

-If I think of any, or anything changes I will edit this review. As of now, literally no complaints.",
"Picked up this tablet recently when the price dipped one evening to about $130 for use as a FPV and telemetry display for flying my Solo quads.  I had been using my Samsung phone, but I wanted a bigger image to help compensate for slightly over 30 eyes.  The 8"" size is perfect, although a tad heavy and about the max that fits in the controller mount.  I had initially tried an older 8"" Lenovo tablet that I already had, but it was incompatible with the app I need to run.  The Tab A is one of the tablets tested to be fully compatible with the app, so I figured I'd just buy one, especially given the price, even though the technology is getting a little dated.  Interestingly, when I'm not out flying, I find myself using this tablet more and more for email, reading the news over coffee in the morning (not CNN or MSNBC fake news!), web searches, Amazon shopping, etc.  It's plenty fast enough for these purposes, the display is sufficiently bright and pleasant to look at, and the battery holds up well for many hours.  It also comes with very usable Microsoft Office apps, although I've so far only found the need to use Word or Excel a couple of times.  The only negative as a FPV display is that the image could be a tad brighter for outdoor use.  But with a sun shade or by standing under a tree to get out of the direct sun, it works pretty well to see where you're flying and to keep track of down-range distance, altitude, flight battery charge state, etc.  For the price paid, this is a really nice tablet in a size that's perfect for me.  Oh yeah, one nice surprise I wasn't expecting: shortly after I started using it, the operating system updated to Android 7!",
"Tl;dr Acer Predator Triton 500 (PT516-52S-73YD) has quality control issues.  Heat dissipation from the GPU goes through the w,a,s,d keys on the keyboard making for VERY uncomfortable gaming unless you use an external keyboard.  GPU started glitching after a week of use.  Acer warranty support technicians couldn’t fix it after 3 attempts and 6 weeks of back-and-forth with their repair center.  The technicians damaged the laptop during the repairs.  Acer Corporate Support tried to replace it with an inferior machine (Acer Nitro 5 with lower specs), which I refused, and Acer has so far refused to issue a refund.

Full story:

My Acer Predator Triton 500 (PT516-52S-73YD) worked well for about a week.  The keyboard, especially under the w,a,s,d keys, would become uncomfortably hot while playing games.  It seemed all the heat from the GPU was dissipating through some of the most popular keys used in gaming keyboard configurations.  This seems a questionable design choice for a gaming laptop.

After about a week, games started to distort, especially in games that utilized fading, video playback, or parallax effects.  Horizontal lines and visual artifacts began appearing during game rendering.  It even affected games with less demanding requirements (e.g. Terraria) and demanding but less visually intense games (e.g. XCOM: Enemy Unknown). The problem became progressively worse over time, and eventually became so bad that games were unplayable.

I sent the laptop back to Acer for repair.  They sent it back unfixed (they just updated the drivers and re-installed the OS, which I had already tried myself).  Immediately sent it back, telling them it was likely a problem with the GPU and explaining exact instructions on how to reproduce the issue. They sent it back unfixed (they replaced the mainboard this time).  Immediately sent it back a third time, this time including a video showing exactly how to reproduce the issue.  They sent it back unfixed (they replaced the mainboard again and the LCD display, damaging my laptop lid in the process).  This whole process took 6 weeks.

I called support, they said all I could do is send it back again.  They said there was no way to escalate the issue or otherwise complain.  I just had to put up with their process.

I ended up calling the Acer corporate number.  I was eventually connected with a “Corporate Customer Support” rep.  That rep tried to offer me a new laptop, a Nitro 5, and tried to pass it off as an upgrade because it had a 2TB hard drive and more memory.  Sure, a bigger hard-drive, but the memory was DDR 4 vs DDR5 and the Nitro 5 they offered had a significantly smaller display resolution and slower refresh rate compared to the Acer Predator Triton 500 I originally purchased.  Plus, the Nitro 5 has a cheaper construction quality (more plastic on the chassis; heavier components; thicker, less portable body; etc).  I declined their offer and asked for them to commit to sending me an exact replacement for the model I purchased (Predator Triton 500).  All I wanted was a commitment that they’d do this, but said they could not make this commitment in a timely fashion, so I requested a full refund.

As of the time of this writing, it’s been a week since I requested the refund, and, despite multiple calls to corporate customer support, they have so far refused to commit to issuing a refund.  I’ve filled out the forms they requested and have provided the proof of purchase they requested.  To be clear, I understand it takes a while for an actual refund to be issued.  All I’m looking for is a commitment that they WILL issue a refund, which they still refuse to give.  The rep I’m working with says that it’s in “the finance department's hands”, and that I have to wait for them to make a decision on whether or not my machine qualifies for a refund, which the rep says could take “weeks”.  When I asked if I could escalate the issue, the rep said no.

I have given Acer 7 weeks now to make this right and to stand behind the quality of their products.  They’ve so far refused to do so.  In the meantime, they are holding the money I spent on this laptop hostage while I’m left with a broken gaming laptop that does not play games.",
I got this laptop five months ago. From the first time I turned it on I've had issues with the monitor and screen tearing on start up. Luckily that issue only happens when I first turn it on. I've also had issues with any time it times out and the screen goes into rest mode or a dark screen it will freeze there and I will have to hard shut down the laptop. Then about 2 months into owning this laptop the wifi card died. Now 5 months in the USB ports have stopped working. It's possible I could have gotten a dud from the factory but my personal experience has been horrible.,
"For the price of the computer, you would expect the build quality to be higher. Battery life is terrible. The screen gets scratched from the keyboard. The keyboard feel is gross. Had a keycap break within 1st month only way to replace it is to send the whole laptop in for 4-10 business days. It can run games well if you prop up the back with something. Otherwise, it gets way too hot.",
"Since there's no way to award stars in half-point increments, I would round up my rating for the Acer Chromebook 315 from 4.5 to 5. The advantages this model offers are plentiful (especially at this price point), and the functional issues are relatively few. Some of my personal gripes are unfortunately inherent in all Chromebooks, so it seems unfair to penalize a product for simply being what it is. Any cons I list will therefore be restricted to those that I consider deficiencies or limitations in comparison to other Chromebooks--and again, I didn't find many. Even the ones I did find, I wouldn't classify as insurmountable.

Display:

>The HD display seems to earn its name. Graphics are crisp and free of distortion, and the 15.6"" display makes even the tiniest icons visible for people with average-to-good eyesight. The display is very aesthetically pleasing overall.
>I don't personally fall into the ""average-to-good"" eyesight category, unfortunately. I've been extremely nearsighted for most of my life, and developing astigmatism in my teens and mild farsightedness around age 40 have done me zero favors. But I'm also not considered seriously visually impaired, so I don't necessarily expect to have difficulty adjusting my display to make my devices optimally functional. While the Acer 315's display settings can certainly be changed and are fairly straightforward to access, the default settings were so very small that it took me more time than it should have to navigate to the menu where I could adjust them. Even then I had to get uncomfortably close to the screen to make sure I was adjusting the correct ones. I realize this won't be a problem for most users, and I wouldn't remotely consider it a reason to avoid buying this particular product, but for people who fall into a similar ""gray area"" it could come as an unpleasant surprise. Some may even want to have help on hand during setup.

Speakers:

>Audio quality and options are probably not going to meet the standards of serious music enthusiasts or gamers, but sound quality is better than average, and will suit dedicated Chromebook users just fine. The upward-facing speakers help with projection as well. In fact, you can produce a surprising amount of volume with them, even on lower settings. I also didn't find that audio quality declined in any appreciable way as volume increased.

System/processing speed:

>Processing speed seems good, even quite fast at times.
> I've experienced a few unexplained crashes, although not many, and I was never able to determine whether it was truly an issue with hardware or due to a specific app or operating system error (or a need to update either). Most device users recognize that outdated software can be pretty buggy, and even up-to-date apps are notorious for having issues, so those seem far more likely culprits in occasional crashes. I wouldn't blame any type of hardware, including the Acer 315, without compelling evidence.

Battery life:

>Battery life has so far been excellent. Even under heavy use, a full charge can easily last 4-6 hours, if not more (I haven't ever pushed it to the limit). It also charges quickly and loses very little charge in sleep mode. I haven't timed it exactly, but I've left the Acer 315 in sleep mode with numerous tabs open for 3-4 days at a stretch, and have lost no more than 10% charge in that time. My regular (older) laptop, along with an older, inexpensive Acer Chromebook in my household will both drain to zero and power off if left sleeping for a comparable amount of time. Hopefully this performance won't decline with age.

Keyboard and touchpad:

>The keyboard layout is pretty standard for a Chromebook; the only real variation is in scale. The keys are comfortably large and appropriately responsive. They also seem to have a surface treatment that makes them slightly rough in texture, and thus resistant to oils and dirt. The coating does that job quite well, which is a point in its favor. However, I've found that if my light source hits the keyboard at just the wrong angle, it renders the labels on the keys all but invisible. This is more of a nuisance than anything, but sometimes changes in brightness or light angle are quite subtle, and it can be quite startling to look down after you've been intently focused on a project for some time and realize that you're momentarily unable to orient your fingers to your keys. Even a slight shift brings them right back into focus, but sometimes even slight positional shifts aren't easily obtained in certain environments. (I did verify this effect with other users in my household to be sure that it wasn't an artifact of my own subpar eyesight. It wasn't.)
>I didn't find the default settings for the touchpad to be intuitive. It was almost *too* responsive, but seemingly only in certain regions. This led to a very frustrating series of unintended exits from various apps, some of which caused me to lose work or progress. Since the options for adjusting the touchpad are quite limited compared to my laptop, it took numerous trial-and-error attempts for me to optimize its function. (And by ""optimize"" I mean that I no longer want to tear my hair out when I use it, not that it's been modified to my personal ideal.)

Design:

>The entire unit is sleek, lightweight, and highly portable. The keyboard and screen are easily twice the size of the older Chromebook model, but the Acer 315 has a slimmer profile and weighs about the same. In fact, the way its weight is distributed actually makes it feel much lighter. Even the charging cable, while a bit cumbersome, isn't especially difficult to fit in a standard 14-16"" Chromebook case and doesn't add much weight.

Overall, I would consider the Acer 315 a very good value. You can certainly find cheaper Chromebooks that will perform the same basic functions, but if you'd prefer one that looks and feels more like a traditional laptop (or one that offers a little more punch for people who enjoy gaming or music at a hobbyist level and would appreciate the ability to translate some of those activities to a Chromebook without a huge loss in experiential quality), the difference in price between the least expensive models and the Acer 315 is neither extreme nor out of proportion. The primary draw of Chromebooks in general has always been the functionality, mobility, and reduced expense offered by cloud-based systems. The Acer 315 seems to represent a sensible and appealing middle ground for people who find that those systems suit their needs well, but don't want or need to go completely bare-bones to get them.

I received this product in exchange for a fair and honest review.",
I love my Acer Chromebook so much! It is amazing! There are no words to tell you how much I love it! Highly recommended! It gets five bright and shining stars!,
"This computer is perfect for me. It has a large screen and nice sleek look to it. I only use it to browse the internet and sometimes transfer different types of files. It has a long battery life, 2 USB 3.0 ports, headphone port, and a couple other ports I don’t recognize. The screen quality is excellent. If you are looking for a computer to perform basic tasks (I don’t know about for things like gaming or video editing), this computer is perfect and comes at an attractive price!",
"This is my first Chromebook and at first I was pretty confused about how to use this. It's a bit of a transition, at first, if you're used to a regular laptop. It turns out, though, that this is actually incredibly simple to use. (They provide good instructions and whenever I got stuck there are plenty of resources online to help walk you through it.)

This is perfect for bringing to conferences because it is so lightweight and I actually prefer it now to my regular laptop for most things because it seems to operate more quickly and with fewer delays.

I receive this through Amazon Vine for review purposes, which is the only reason I ever ended up trying out a Chromebook, but now that I've gotten used to it, I find myself preferring this to my regular laptop.

For the price, I think it's a very good product!",
"I’m very pleased with the Acer Chromebook 315.  This is our third chromebook.  I have one for my husband and one for my son-in-law.  This is a good for general word processing, and for watching Netflix, social media sites, and videos.  For the price, this is a very good machine.  It’s not good for gaming (too slow for complex games), but it does everything we need it for. The screen is a good size, and has good resolution.  The sound is good.  It all depends on what you are using it for.  It charges fast and keeps the charge.  Overall, this is very good for the price.",
"Buyer bewared! A CB315 w/ an AMD A4 and w/o touchscreen should not be sold for $428. That's the price of the CB315 AMD A6 WITH Touchscreen. Seller trying to get over on people that don't know better. This is GREAT product, but the price is almost twice what it should be listed for.",
"This is my first chromebook, but I've had a bunch of laptop computers, and a couple tablets. This certainly fills a helpful niche for a lot of people. It's fast and responsive. Does all of the basic tasks you might want it to if you don't need to load special software onto a machine for anything specific. It's not small, at 15"", so it's not your lightest or most portable chromebook option, but it'll fit into most adult backpacks (how I usually carry my stuff) or laptop bags. The screen is decent, and sound is good (it can fill a small room with sound fairly well). It has a built-in MicroSD card reader that I really wish was a normal-sized SD card reader, which I find more useful. The ability to charge via a USB-C cable, from either side of the computer, is handy. I do also wish it had an HDMI port for easier connections to projectors and such. Pretty sure the USB-C port can output the signal if I had the right adapter, but I don't (yet?). Plenty of apps are available from the Play store. Though not certain ones I had hoped for, like my kindle app (Amazon and Google don't get along in Chromebook-land, I guess; I found a workaround in the Kindle cloud reader). Anyway, this is a cheap way to get a fast and useful internet-connected device that does a lot of things well.",
"Okay I'm giving this Acer Chromebook 5 stars! I'm basing this on everything the chromebook has to offer at it's price point. It's not going to be the most amazing chromebook out there, but it's under 300 dollars people!  One of the major pros to this chromebook is it's 15.6 inch screen. This is alot larger than most chromebooks that average about 11 to 14 inches.  It also offers 1080p which sounds great but stretched out across the 15.6 inch screen it does make some graphics and fonts a little bit  blurry. The product page on Amazon says Acer say the battery life lasts up ton10 hours, I'd say that definitely depends on what you're doing. Watching my daughter play on it, I'd say that it lasts at about 7 hours but that's mostly playing games. Another cool feature is the two upward facing speakers that flank both sides of the keyboard, and the touchpad is a rather larger size. This particular chromebook is not a touchscreen screen, but you are able to use the play store which isn pretty awesome being able to use some many apps. It has USB c ports and a headphone Jack port as well. It does come with a web cam, and the outside of the computer is a nice silver.  Overall based on the price point I think this is a great chromebook for kids!",
"This is a great little Chromebook, perfect for homework or movies on car trips.  It's not the highest end, but it's more than adequate for every day use around the house and has really nice picture quality.",
I am no computer expert so for my needs it is perfect. The screen quality is fantastic and my photos don't do it justice. It's easy to navigate and responds quickly when you click on something. Set up only takes 5 minutes and you are ready to go. I love the slim and sleek look of this chromebook. The only thing I don't like about this Acer is how far up the keyboard is. It makes it hard to type comfortably.,
"I wasn't exactly sure what I was expecting since I've never had a laptop with a Chrome OS.  The thing that works for this laptop is that a student working in the cloud will love this - it opens fast, you can work with Office 365 or Google Docs - anything you can do online, this machine is up for the task.  It is not, however, a gaming computer at all unless it is a game you can play online.  The OS of this laptop does not require the RAM that Windows requires so it is an on/off fast laptop.  It is a large laptop which may be good or bad, depending on the person.  The keyboard isn't cramped at all, it has nice-sounding speakers and usb/earphone ports.  The best part is considering what laptops cost, getting this one is within reach of most students.  My daughter and I talked about the cost - I bought my HP laptop with Windows 10 a couple of years ago as a refurbished one at the local computer shop and it still cost me $600 - new, it still, today, is retailing for $1200!  For a tad over $200, you can grab this one and have pretty much everything you need.",
"The first time I started this computer up, and connected to our wifi, it spent 2 hours updating. Once it was updated, it worked great.
The computer itself isn't very powerful, it runs like my galaxy note 9 phone. But it does have the ability to connect to everything I do on Google (not creepy at all!) and all the passwords and bookmarks loaded with no issues.
The battery life lasted almost 4 hours with constant use, which included video watching in the background. Overall, a great computer for surfing the internet, or doing homework on.",
"I was already familiar with Chromebooks as my kids were given them to use by their high schools. This is a good, basic, no frills computer. Best suited to students and perhaps seniors who don't too much online.  Definitely not a gaming laptop or anything that uses complex graphics, but you can still go to basic websites and they render fine. The battery life is pretty good and the sound is clear. Overall, an inexpensive computer that's perfect for simpler needs.",
"This chromebook was easy to set up and log on to with my existing Google account.

I tried several of my existing Google apps and they did not work. For example, Google Duo kept crashing.

I also tried to use the Pandora app but that didn't work either. Ditto for Prime Video.

I ended up accessing Pandora and Prime Video through their websites and I am able to listen to music and watch movies from the web.

The picture quality is good for the price point and so is the sound quality. Nothing spectacular, but this is a relatively inexpensive product.

At the time of this review the retail price was around $270 on sale which seems fairly reasonable for the quality.",
"This is my first chrome book, so it's taking a bit of getting used to, but it is quite simple to learn and use. This laptop has a bright clear screen and seems to have good battery life. I haven't used it much but so far it's been great for browsing the web, and using some of the supported apps. The key board is more spaced out then my work one so although likely better for some that are used to that (for example my wife's power book has similar key board spacing) it throughs me off some because I use my work laptop every day where as this one I use less often. One other thing about the keyboard is that it does have the Home and end keys. If you are a regular user of these keys like I am it can be a bit annoying. I haven't really put it through any major stress, but it seems powerful enough to proforma the tasks I'm using it for. I personally would probably buy a smaller screen chrome book next time, but nothing about the discription was miss leading, just a change in my preference. The items above I complained about are me being a bit nit picky, over all it's a great chrome book for it's intended use.",
"There are a lot of reasons to love this. For me the most practical uses are students, and also older folks who are used to the cell phone interface, and do not need any sort of sophisticated function. It is wonderful for basic web surfing using Google Chrome. I also use it with Photoshop and it works absolutely beautifully! I am getting used to the file sharing, and otherwise the setup. This is much more user friendly for those who are used to the app setup on a laptop then those of us who grew up on the Windows OS.

I do love that you can get whatever you need on the App store, there is so much cost free technology to dump on and use. The keyboard is wonderful, and silent. I love the screen size, and the clarity is pretty good, but not perfect. It isn't the ideal machine if you are looking for solid graphics and resolution. The speed of the machine is pretty good overall for what we use it for.

You do need a Google account to setup the machine. IF you have a Samsung phone, you already have one, or if you use a Google calendar, etc. Not hard, just another step (but cost free) if you don't have a Google account.

Basically this is a good student machine. I don't see a wide application outside of that, but it can be used for low use households looking for very basic functionality at a good price.",
"This Acer Chromebook 315 CB315-2H-455L was offered to me in my Amazon Vine selection.  I like Chromebooks and my family has owned at least one for the past few years.  I also like Acer products.  We own both Acer desk top computers and Acer Chromebooks.  We basically use the Chromebooks for internet browsing, social media and Netflix viewing.  Obviously, those things can be done on cell phones and smaller devices, but we prefer a larger screen.  This Acer Chromebook 315 is a very nice Chromebook.  It is a definite upgrade from the Acer Chromebook N3060 I purchased earlier this year.  (It also costs more.)  The first thing I noticed was how sleek looking it was; I love its brushed silver finish and its nice, large screen.  I also noticed that it powers up and operates quickly, has good resolution and has good speakers.  I thought it might have a backlit keyboard, but that is on the touch screen versions (CB315-2HT), which are a bit more expensive.  (There are currently 6 different versions of the Chromebook 315 on the Acer website.)  For those who have not used a Chromebook before, be aware that Chromebook does not utilize Microsoft Office; it runs on Chrome OS.  However, Chrome OS can edit, download, and convert the Microsoft Office files in Google Docs, Sheets and Slides.  In addition, a Chromebook does not have a CD/DVD drive, but an external drive can be attached.  Bottom line, we like this Chromebook:  It looks good and performs well.

That basically sums up my personal viewpoint.  However, this Chromebook offers a lot, more than the usual Chromebook, and the above paragraph doesn’t address all of that.  Here is some additional information taken from the Acer website:  “This impressive Acer Chromebook 315 is an ideal replacement for a desktop. Its large screen and upward facing speakers make it perfect for watching videos and video conferencing.  It is Acer’s first Chromebook powered by AMD A-Series Processors with Radeon Graphics.  The processors enable customers to stream video, run the latest apps, play web games and browse the Internet effortlessly.  It also supports millions of Android apps on Google Play for entertainment, productivity, connectivity and more.”

In conclusion, this Acer Chromebook 315 is an excellent Chromebook, more advanced than previous models.  It looks great and performs well.  We like this Chromebook and would recommend.  However, if someone is only going to use a Chromebook for internet browsing and video viewing, they could get by with a less expensive Chromebook, which Acer also sells.",
"I set up this Acer Chromebook 315 for my mother to use since she needs something simple. Because it doesn’t have a disk drive, it boots up very quickly and she really likes this feature. It is lightweight and small with a 15.6” screen. She also mostly uses it to surf the net and check email. This device is good for users that have only these basic needs. Be aware that you will be operating within the Google environment – Linux-based Chrome OS, Chrome browser, Gmail, etc. The Google OS will not recognize MPG video files, unfortunately. The device has 2 USB-C ports and 2 USB 3.0 ports. The worst negative feature is the screen resolution. There is no way it is high definition, the way the manufacturer states. The so-called “ComfyView” HD – 1366 x 768 provides a viewing experience that really strains my mom’s eyes. Beyond the crappy resolution, you have to look at the screen head-on to be able to read anything because the viewing angle is so narrow. I couldn’t figure out a way to permanently enlarge the text on the screen for her. This really would be a great device for seniors if it had decent screen resolution. I can’t even imagine trying to watch movies on this thing.",
"I'm not a computer expert and this review will be strictly from a layman's viewpoint. I had another Chrome Book a couple of years ago and it died on me within weeks (battery issues that I had to have repaired repeatedly) so I've been using this for a while to make sure it actually kept working (it has).

There's a slight learning curve if you're switching to a Chrome Book from a traditional laptop or desktop computer. This doesn't have nearly the same amount of pure function; yes, there are apps available through the Google Play store for just about anything but it still won't help this machine edit images and videos like a laptop or process documents like a Windows-based system. It's a basic computer for basic tasks like watching Netflix or Hulu (great screen resolution), surfing the internet and document processing via Google Docs.

As far as performance, it's good for what it is. There are a number of things I'm still having a difficult time with: the keyboard is smaller than usual and it takes me a bit each time to get my hands in the right place so I'm not typing gibberish; the touchpad is kind of a mess - sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't and the right-click has to be done with a great deal of finesse and two fingers pressed on a very specific (occasionally random) place on the pad. The entire thing freezes up on me sometimes and I generally don't do much beyond basic word processing, a little web surfing and organizing files.

For its price point, this is a fairly decent choice if you aren't married to the idea of a Windows laptop. I will always wish it had more function but the truth is, I don't do the same kinds of things on a computer that I used to (gaming, photo editing) and this will probably be more than enough.",
"First, this is not meant to be a laptop.  As a Chromebook, the primary function of this device is to work through the Google/Chrome interface to accomplish what you need to do.  As such, RAM needs are smaller than a laptop's (not running anything but a browser or Android apps) and the hard drive doesn't need to be that large (though if you want a lot of apps or a lot of media to watch or listen to offline, you will need a microSD card).  It also relies primarily on being connected to the Internet.  You can do things offline, but its strength is working online.  So, knowing what this is, and how it's intended to be used, it works as expected.

Because this is 15.6 inches, the keyboard is full size and is comfortable to use.  However, the lack of page up/page down keys or a delete key is a frustration for working in a document.  Because this is a Chromebook, though, you get some extra keys for working in the browser that are nice to have to make a mouse less necessary.  There are keys for back, forward, and refresh, as well as full screen and going back.  There are also volume up, volume down, and mute keys.  Again, working through a browser (or an Android interface, these are nice.  The screen is easy to read at its size, but like many reviewers say, it's not as sharp as you would expect.  It falls into that ""good enough"" category.  I work mostly with documents, so I'm not worried about my hi-def video experience.

It has two USB-C and two USB-A (the rectangular one we always put things in upside down in) 3.1 ports, so connecting peripherals is no problem.  The Chromebook also charges through either USB-C port.  There is also a microSD slot for that oh-so-necessary offline storage.  It worked just fine with a 256GB SanDisk microSD card I tried.  Battery life runs about 7 hours so far, though I know after discharging and recharging a few times it may go up a little.  Size and weight are very good.  It's less than an inch when closed, and though the specs say 6 pounds, it feels lighter than that.  Built-in webcam, microphone and speakers (which are surprisingly good) make this good for video chatting as well.

All told, this is very nice machine for performing the basics.  I experienced no lag on videos (from the drive and the microSD card), and the few apps I loaded were snappy.  I didn't do any gaming, but this should work pretty much like an Android tablet for that, so if it runs well on a tablet, it should run well here.  It's not a fully loaded laptop, but it's not meant to be, and for what it is, there are no complaints.  Older adults or school age children will find it more than adequate, and even other users will not be disappointed in having it do what it's meant for.",
"I won't get into Chromebook vs tablet vs laptop--- that's outside the scope of a product review, and I'm writing the review based on the assumption that you are definitely in the market for a Chromebook.

My bottom line is that the 315 is a good buy. It isn't perfect but for the price it offers a lot.

Features including several USB C ports, an A port, and a microSD slot, which is a good thing to augment the rather vanilla 32 GB internal storage. It comes with 4 GB of RAM, which is fine for nearly all Chromebook uses. The screen is just over 15 inches with HD resolution in 1920x1080 native. The built-in keyboard looks lost in the body of the unit, but it's full-size for the most part. Upward facing speakers run down each side of the keyboard. The touchpad is truly enormous.

The unit uses a dedicated charger though it appears you could charge it more slowly from a USB charger with less current capacity. You can charge through any of the USB C ports, which is very convenient.

Wifi is 802.11ac (and lower) dual band. Very fast, and it's today's standard.

Set-up is trivial. Connect to wifi, log in to your Google account, let the software update and that's it. You'll surely want to adjust the touchpad speed and some other things, but that's easy enough. There is an online manual (as usual these days, very little documentation comes in the box).

I had no objections to the display, although it seems not everyone likes it. I thought the colors were good and the resolution quite good enough. Yes, there are other devices with higher resolution. For most internet and media consumption, you'll do fine with this device. You aren't going to be editing 4k videos with it, but it never was sold for that.

Performance is fast and snappy. You can install Android apps very easily and most (not all) work as expected. There is also a Linux subsystem feature, which gives you even more options, but that isn't yet fully developed.

This unit doesn't have a touch screen. I consider that a feature rather than a lack. This isn't a tablet and the touchpad lets you do everything you want without having to lift your hand and poke at the screen.

The keyboard is okay. The tactile feel is good enough if nothing special. There are some compromises --- you have to fool with an auxiliary key to get function keys, the arrows are half size, there is no explicit page up/page down and many others are missing, but there are combination chords available for some of the missing things. Still, this is probably the weakest part of the ensemble. Given all the real estate available, this could and should have been done much better.

Bluetooth works as expected with no issues; just be aware that it's on by default. Turn it off to save a little on battery if not in use.

Battery life is easily 6 hours, depending on usage, and can be as much as 10. It's enough for a day's intermittent work or a longish flight (okay, not L.A. to Paris, but still).

The unit has a beautiful brushed aluminum finish (must be back in style again?). It is heavier and larger than I might like, but you can't get a 15.6 inch screen into a small case, either. Definitely buy a sleeve for this so the aluminum doesn't scratch.

As to build quality it seems quite sturdy and well made.

This is a very good deal on a Chromebook. There is a lot here for the price. It is not perfect, and I do take one star off for the keyboard and the weight. So four stars as my bottom line.",
Yes,
The battery completely died with in 3 months. The replacement had damaged pixels  in the exact middle of the screen which is REALLY noticeable.,
Love it!,
Worth the price.,
Junk!  Purchased and used for less than 6 months and no longer charges.  Called Acer and I need to ship it back and pay for shipping.,
"Good price, great quality",
I bought this for my daughters zoom learning. It’s awful. We haven’t used it since the third day of class. She is instead using my Mac book air,
This laptop is so easy to use - reliable and fast. I couldn't be more pleased.,
"I've been using this mostly for college, almost all of my assignments are done online, with some movie streaming here and there. Pretty reliable and great for everything I needed.",
This computer is about as fast as my Packard Bell desktop I had with dial up internet service in 1996.  I'm not a tech guy so I don't know if the unit is corrupted or just plain slow out of the box.  It is also heavy and cumbersome.  I would not recommend this laptop at all.,
"If all you want to do is surf the internet then this computer is fine.  With the Google operating system it is too difficult to save items, print items, just plain use it for basic operations.  Wish I had purchased any other computer system besides Google chrome.",
Garbage. First charger stopped working and had to buy a new one. Then computer stopped working 6 months after purchasing it. But have a one year warranty. Send it back to Acer for repair. Now mind you nothing was done to damage it. I receive a call that the warranty is not covered due to water spill. Never happened. It’s just their way of not honoring warranty. They offer me what sounds like a refurbished one for nearly the cost that I paid for the original. Thank god I have a Apple MacBook. This was just a computer for my mother in law to go on the internet. Buyer beware.,
"First, there is no touch screen. I think this was a special ""black friday"" design. It does not work as well or as quick as the 11"" Acer it is replacing. Also, it is constantly running out of memory. The appearance is nice and the display is much nicer, but overall I would say I am disappointed. Forget the battery life. Now almost 6 months old and I am having to constantly recharge it.",
I’ve been on hold as they’re saying my warranty is up but i purchased a separate warranty,
Better than expected,
It meets my expectation.  Quality and easy to use.  The screen size meets my expectation.,
"We got this laptop as an extra device to be shared among members of our household. The hope was that our school aged child could use the computer for school work and entertainment, and that the adults could use it for surfing the internet, streaming media, answering email, and doing some work related tasks and projects.

Pros:

It is light and sleek, with a hard durable case.
We have been able to watch movies and shows on Netflix, Hulu, YouTube, and Amazon Prime with no problems.
We use this computer in the kitchen to look up recipes.
This computer was great when we needed to watch a how-to Netflix video for a DIY appliance repair. It is better than continually consulting our smartphones.
We use this computer to stream podcasts and audio books. The sound is a little tinny, but decent quality.
This computer is fast to start and load webpages.
We use this computer to watch videos and shows when we are exercising at home.

Cons:

The touchpad and keyboard don't feel very intuitive. The touchpad feels more sluggish than others we have used. You  can hook a mouse up to the computer, which helps a bit.
For a fast typist, this is a frustrating keyboard to use. It slowed us down and we made more typos than usual. It is not a great computer to use to type out a long email, or update a google spreadsheet or work on your novel in a google doc.
The screen is pretty awful. Text on webpages looks small and a little fuzzy. I'm a 40-something adult and have to constantly zoom in to make the text bigger on every page and then I still feel like I'm squinting and getting a headache. Ideal for a kid doing a quick homework assignment. Not ideal for a far-sighted adult working on a writing project, reading long news articles, or answering more than a few emails.
Video quality is disappointing. It satisfies the child who wants to watch cartoons, but an adult trying to have a quality video watching experience is going to be disappointed.

Verdict:
You get what you pay for. For the cost, $300, this computer suits our basic home entertainment and web surfing needs. It is an easy computer for a child to use. If you are a college student or professional who needs a computer to do actual work on, this is not going to meet your needs",
"Bought this to replace my older Acer Chromebook (4 years). It has more onboard memory, two usb-c ports and high definition screen. The screen is amazingly crisp even in sunlight. The charger plugs into either usb-c port to charge (so much better than those round pins that work loose). It was a breeze to transfer files from my old Chromebook to this one through the cloud. The sound is much better as well with headphones on Spotify or Prime Music. I'm very happy with it.",
"I hate using this Chromebook because even with just a few tabs open in Chrome, it LAGS.  I have another very similar chromebook that is much better (Acer 15.6in FHD(1920x1080) IPS Touchscreen Business Chromebook- Aluminum Metal Body, Intel Celeron N3350 Processor, 4GB LPDDR4 RAM, 32GB SSD, WiFi, Bluetooth, Chrome OS-(Renewed))  I don't know if it's because this one has an AMD processor and the other has an Intel, but this one was new and the other was refurbished and less expensive.  I can't even use Zoom with everything else closed, and it's NOT my internet service because everything else I have works fine.  It also feels cheaper than the other one i have - the body is very plastic feeling...well it is plastic so what else would I expect.  By the way, I never review things but I just dislike this chromebook so much!  Only buy it if you are desperate (as I was during the beginning of the Covid quarantine, so it was better than nothing), and if you only plan on having one chrome tab open at a time.",
"My win laptop fried. This is my first Chromebook. I really like, ease of set up, how easy it is to browse. I set up my printer by pluging it into a usb port. This cost me 1/3 ofmy last laptop and it is equal in speed, battery life is better. If you need a computer consider this.",
good Chromebook,
"Very fast, excellent display, The best Chromebook for the money.",
"I've always been suspicious about Dell computers as they usually always have problems. This one is nothing but pure junk. Granted it's refurbished, so I'll take that into consideration. First  off, it's very heavy for a laptop, and it gets super hot within minutes. It crashes like crazy and is out for repair for the second time in less than a year.",
"The case looks great, and I was able to find speakers and the microphone to match the display lights on the CPU. Just be aware that you have to buy speakers and a microphone separately.",
Love everything about it,
Great for prebuilt worked out of the box if your looking for a good streaming/gaming PC I play ark modded while streaming on this looks cool too,
"Love the computer however there is two issues which really affected my experience,  the IO backplate motherboard is miss aligned and top two ports aren't straight and I can't use any of the use of usb ports due it isn't placed in correctly, the video card is already bending/sagging ( hangging of the left the backplate) and this is a new product I'm hoping , box was already opened when receiving today.

Deciding to return it because QC is poor.",
"Its beautiful it's sleek and doing the math at the time was not a bad deal at all.
I wanted to wait a few months before doing a review but this thing is a powerhouse. It's met all my needs and then some. I've had 0 hardware  or software
issues as of this review",
"It literally does everything I could want it to do. It showed up in perfect condition, arrived early, and booted up immediately. Performs great, runs all the games I currently play (destiny 2, cyberpunk, overwatch) I couldn’t recommend this more. Very happy!",
"Bought this thinking it would be a great computer to game with.  Unfortunately never made it passed powering up.  Wont post and wont even display anything on the monitor, wont light the keyboard up.  Came with broken plastic pieces in the case as well.  Not sure why these companies seem to think skimping on there quality is ok.  Wont be buying from here again!",
"I bought this to replace a ten year old commercial workstation computer.  I wanted to build my own but did not want to pay the current market inflated prices for a video card.

After researching the brand (MSI) for its products (motherboards and video cards mainly), I compared this offerings against the open market (brick and mortar stores and online computer sellers) for turn-key systems from the main name brands and some of the boutique makers.  This unit was the best 'value' and price for what it actually offered (DDR5, 12th gen i7 CPU, RTX video card, and m2 SSD 3Gb/s hard drive, liquid cooling).

The box was well packed (no issues with damage in delivery) and everything worked at boot up time.

Its VERY fast - I installed benchmarking software (PassMark) and it scored in the 98%-tile overall.  Being a former hardware builder and tweaker, I fiddled with the overclocking software - very easy to use and had gained a modest bump.  Even in stock settings, it plays the newest games with all settings maxed out (at 2550x1440 resolution, 144hz) with a very high frame rate.  It supports 4k but I cannot afford a 4k monitor.....

I have been very impressed and would recommend.",
"I must say that the computer ran quite well for those two hours. It was fast and quiet. However, two hours in I got a ""Watchdog Violation,"" and the computer blue-screened. When it turned back on it would only load to BIOS and no longer recognized that the M2 drive was installed in the motherboard. Nothing I tried would get it to load to the boot drive. I contacted technical support and they told me to return it which I did. I have since ordered a new one directly from the manufacturer, because again, prior to the blue screen it worked fine. I give it one star here purely because I cannot excuse a 2-hour lifespan...hopefully if you decide to get it the computer it will live longer. If possible, I will update you with how the direct from the manufacturer version goes.

Edit:
After returning the one from Amazon, I ordered a new one directly from the manufacturer. The one from the manufacturer took a week to arrive, but so far (about 5 days in) it works great. It runs fast and cool. I updated the star rating from 1 to 4 stars because I expect a version even from Amazon to work just as well as one directly from the manufacturer. Although I have not run the highest spec games on it so far, however, I have run CPU intensive games usually do not get the CPU above 50 C and only has a CPU usage of about 40%. RAM is DDR5 and has run fine, most of the time only 50% of the 16GB is being used. The MSI center runs a little weird and seems like it is trying to base GPU numbers on the integrated graphics and not the 3070ti, but Nvidia can give you numbers on the GPU. Hopefully, this computer lasts a while, glad to know I got a year warranty from MSI.",
Video Player is loading.,
"I purchased this product sold by Amazon during the black Friday sale.

I usually build my own systems, but the price of this product on the black Friday sale was cheaper than I could build the equivalent system myself.

When I received this system, the rear ports are blocked by the I/O shield. Either the motherboard is warped, not mounted properly in the case, or the I/O shield is not stamped properly, and cables cannot be plugged into several of the rear ports.

I noticed that another Amazon customer had the same problem, and posted a photo before returning the system.

The photo posted to Amazon looked so much the same as mine, that I thought it might be possible that the defective system had been sent back out to me, until I searched the web, and this appears to be  a common defect and is happening a lot to MSI customers.

Rather than rip this thing apart and diagnose the problem, I called Amazon to replace it.

At first the Amazon rep said that, because this is a high dollar item, I would have to return it for a refund and repurchase it, effectively losing my black Friday discount. Then he called this a minor defect, and I corrected him that not being able use use some of the important ports of a new system (LAN, keyboard USB, mouse USB) is NOT a minor defect.

He said Amazon could not replace the system because it was a high dollar item, and could only refund it. I told him that this was not acceptable, and he checked with a supervisor. He then said that they could not replace the system because they didn't have any more in stock. I am pretty sure I verified that they had some in stock before I called Amazon, but I checked and indeed it was out of stock.

I asked if I could get it replaced by MSI since it was a new system shipped with a defect. He brought a MSI customer rep on line by the name of Hank to see if MSI could replace this defective system. Hank said that, since the system was sold by Amazon, MSI could not replace the system. I could send it in for warranty repair, but I would receive a refurbished system to replace my new, defective system, and that is not acceptable.

We finally agreed that Amazon would replace the system if they got a replacement in stock before my return window closes. I offered that I would not boot or initialize the system to make it easier for MSI to process the return and repair the defect, and the Amazon rep thanked me for that.

I am waiting for Amazon to get this product back in stock so I can keep my black Friday discount. I noticed that there is another vendor that has this product in stock for the same price as my black Friday discount with good reviews on Amazon, but searching reviews outside of Amazon I found many complaints, and I also found complaints with the Better Business Bureau, some of which seem to be unresolved, so I have decided not to purchase from them.",
"Love the included RGB keyboard and the mouse. The system i chose was with I7 1200K and Nvidia 3070TI. I do photo editing with photoshop and lightroom and this alder lake processor is fantastic. Smoothly loads high resolution images. Gaming performance is stellar and i believe the 3070 TI is the best value for ultra 1440p gaming and moderate 4k gaming as well. I got the PC at around 2000 during a brief sale so i got very good value but even at 2100 its still great value for the kind of performance you get.

System runs cool and I'm a big fan of the somewhat understated design of the case. I like RGB and all but the fact that there is a button on the pc that can cycle the different light schemes and turn the RBG off is very practical and welcomed feature. I chose MSI because of their reputation for quality and quality is what i got. No regrets",
It was a gift,
I just got it and I love it it's very high quality.,
Perfect for on the go I love how easy work is because of this laptop,
Everything from stocks to searches fantastic it simple,
First time chrome book user very impressed how easy to set up and use fast and lightweight great battery life,
Better off spending more money on a laptop. I got this as a gift off of my wish list and it has been awfuful. Especially if you want to watch netflix it's a nightmare. I had a full what and have used it for less then two weeks and it is dead without even using it. Junk. Wish I had taken the time to read reviews and done my research. Mistake that's for sure. So many flaws in this product.,
"We bought this Chromebook on May 31, 2021 for our son. It had been a good device for him until April 1, 2022. The screen started flickering or just going black and a small amount of smoke came from the device. I contacted HP Customer Support as the Chromebook was sold with a 1 year warranty. Interesting, that according to HP, the warranty began on March 31, 2021 and expired March 31, 2022. Wow! So the warranty started 2 months before we bought the device and ended THE DAY BEFORE IT DIED?!?! That is exceedingly convenient for HP. BEWARE! I will never buy another HP product if this is how they do business.",
"Super sleek and light, but with a quality feel to it. My favorite feature is how quick setup is to get things up and running. I’m no tech expert, but the screen image seems great to me. Also fairly happy with the speaker quality. Seems to pretty much exactly what I was looking for.",
Es como una tablet con teclado,
100%+,
Great for school learning,
Easy to set up and use,
It works great! Wonderful value!,
The best item I've ever brought from Amazon! Great for my daughter being in online school great for checking email,
"Screen was very dark, kept throwing my son out of his Google class, not so easy to set up. My son had to keep his finger pressed down on the On button for (i kid you not) at least 3-5 mins in order to turn ON...I ended up returning it asap! I then ordered the 2021 touchscreen Lenovo Chromebook and my son loves it!!! plus It's compatible with Google classroom perfectly!!",
Fully charged battery only lasted 2 hours,
So far these laptops have worked great for my kids to use for school. They are easy to navigate even for my 7 year old. It helps that they are lightweight and not heavy or bulky.,
"Honestly I expected more out of this. Other than school stuff it is basically a paperweight.  If you are going to pay this kind of money, you should just get a real laptop. I needed to connect to VPN for work from home, and of course, after spending 200+ $ on this, I absolutely could not. I consider it an expensive lesson.",
Very fast and good quality,
Great little laptop for distance learning. My Kindergartner does well with it and she thinks she’s a big deal now that she has her own laptop.,
My son loves this laptop to play games and watch videos.,
"The Chromebook I received was packaged well and for a beginner it’s perfect. It’d be good for travel and light work. The speakers are okay, the screen is a matte finish so if you move the screen a certain way it perfectly clear, if it’s off kilter it’s like a rainbow reflection. A lot can be done and it’s pretty quick. Docs and Play works well not for gaming but great for streaming and the Bluetooth works great.",
"I wanted to pick up a cheap laptop to replace my 9 year old macbook air as the battery on the air was only lasting a mere 2 hours these days. I didn't want to spend a pretty penny on something that will mainly be used for surfing the web. I began doing a good amount of research into chromebooks, as expected they range in price from soup to nuts. I settled on this HP as it checked all the boxes for my needs. I've owned the device a mere two weeks at the time I am writing this review but so far the battery life is excellent and the chromebook is snappy and responsive. I would recommend this device as I believe it'll meet the majority of folks needs.",
"I like the notebook a lot. Apparently it's a tablet with a keyboard, not a ""real"" laptop, the accessories provided that doubled the cost of the tablet by itself aren't worth the extra money. You're better off buying the tablet as a stand-alone without the extra accessories.",
This is the newest model in which the school used. It is more vivid. Faster and stores more data. Also a good price,
I use it for school and it works amazing. Never had a computer that works better,
"I had a problem with the first generation of the Surface Book where the battery of the tablet portion would refuse to charge. Between hardware improvements and firmware updates, this seems solved now. So I highly recommend this laptop.

Pros:

The detachable tablet mode is great. If you want to view a recipe in the kitchen, read a book on the screen without the weight of the base - tablet mode is great and easy to use.

The Surface Pen is mostly great. They sell a pack of interchangeable tips on the website. I've done some light drawing and various activities with the pen and the touchscreen - all input modes are great.

Plenty of ports. Unlike some competitors (Apple) this Surface has plenty of USB ""type A"" ports which makes it compatible with your existing peripherals.

Cons:

The second generation is notably heavier than the first. My wife finds it to be fairly cumbersome, and prefers the Surface Pro for weight reasons.

Firmware is still iffy. I did have a battery charging problem at one point, caused by bad drivers. The laptop battery was at 0% so it only worked connected to the base. I researched online and found out I had to uninstall the battery driver, and restart the system, to resolve it. If my base battery had been dead, the laptop would have been dead. Microsoft is not perfect yet, but they're a lot better than they used to be.

Overall:

A lovely laptop. Expensive, but feature-rich. As a great mobile laptop, drawing tablet, or general-purpose laptop this is a great choice.",
"I have a Microsoft Surface tablet, so this is a bit of leap-of-faith.  I did not like the Surface tablet due to its light integration with the keyboard. This device however is solid.  It can be fully used like a laptop on your lap, as well as a tablet when it is disconnected.
Like the Surface tablet though it lacks access to a sizable amount of apps that an ipad or an Android app would have, so impacts its use as a tablet.

However as a laptop, it’s pretty decent.

ITS SPECS
**** Intel 7th Gen Core i5
**** 8GB RAM
**** 256 GB Solid state
**** Intel HD Graphics 620
**** Display resolution max: 3000 x 2000 pixels
**** 13.5 PixelSense Touchscreen with pen input
**** 17 hour battery life

WHAT YOU GET:
The Surface Book itself which is a tablet attached to a keyboard. This is a well integrated connection, that makes you think of it as a 13” laptop. Detaching the tablet is a simple button push.  Reattaching it is as simple as pushing the two pieces back together.  This is an electronic release and relatch, and amazingly the laptop does not have to be turned on, to detach or attach.

LIGHTING KEYBOARD
The keyboard, is a lighting keyboard and I have noted when using it on your lap it can be hard to see the symbols on the keys, at the initial setting. . The contrast of the key color to the symbol color is quite low at the initial setting of the keyboard lighting.  So I have found myself in a fairly well lit room having to turn up the keyboard lighting, or turning it off entirely. Simple enough, but it concerned me at first. Once I tweaked the setting, it was fine.

POWER CABLES
The power cables which are in two pieces.  One from the computer to the transformer, which is the magnetic catch type seen in the Surface tablets.  The other is the transformer to the wall plug. This is a pet peeve of mine.  Here you have this elegant lap top solution and this big clunking transformer block.  You can slip this beautiful computer into a nice case, only to have this behemoth block, you need to find space for.  Granted it has sleeker lines that others, but it would be nice to have it a whole lot slimmer and an easy way to wrap up the cord

SETUP:
Setup is your typical Windows PC setup. This one like the tablet includes face recognition which is nice. Lighting can confuse it and you might have to repeat this process, but it is worth it. Sometimes too when it is looking for you, you may not have the top fully open, so the camera can’t see you.  Then you just put in your pin.

USAGE:
I’ve written all this review on this system, which isn’t that much typing, but being a touch typer, if the keyboard was set funny would have me swearing by now.  I once had an iPad keyboard solution that moved a few keys for size.  Drove me batty. While you don’t think you use a comma much, go ahead and move that on your keyboard and find out. This keyboard is nice and has the right feel.
Battery life is great. I’ve used it for hours and hours and plugged it in only after I noted it was in the 50% range.
Lap use. One thing that makes a laptop nice is its portability and this one with the 13.5” display makes it like a small laptop and it is  light and easy to carry around. . Even though the tablet is a heavier display, it does not cause balance issues on your lap when using as a laptop.

OTHERS OPINIONS:
I brought this device into work, to show two much younger colleagues that were enthusiastic to see  what it could do and how it was set up.
After playing with it for a day, I learned a few things.
You can charge the tablet separate from the keyboard, there is a slot on the side of the tablet.  I had never looked but this makes sense.
I thought the default display size for a browser, seemed small. But, being as I’m older did not trust that. They are in their mid twenties (both UI people) and they thought the size was small too.  Whenever you go to change this it gives you a warning and that other apps might be blurry but you could optimize for this. It kind of bothers me that the default is in the range of less usable.  We found the display default was 200%, we preferred 250%.

Both of them were unsure this product would have a use for them.
One had a PC desktop at home and a Mac laptop with a Mac laptop at work, so he was versed in both PC and Mac, but had no use for a laptop of this type and since this was a Windows tablet it’s appeal was limited.
The other had a Mac laptop at home and at work, but regularly does Microsoft app training, so was versed in Microsoft products. He felt the heavier screen since it was a separate tablet, made it unbalanced as a laptop.  Though he was a graphic designer, the removable tablet that you could draw on, had no appeal.  While he indicated this device was the best example of a 2 in 1 laptops, he was not sure he had a need for that type of device in retrospect.

Their joint concern was similar to mine in that usage as a tablet is limited by the available software. In order to give this device a fair shake, I was going to investigate what type of software for use in a tablet was available for this device.

SOFTWARE FOR THE WINDOWS TABLET:
I spent some time looking around on the tablet for Software. There seems to be a decent amount of Free pen drawing software (as well as ones you can buy) and a range of productivity software that is both paid and unpaid.  I don’t see a tremendous amount of games and that would typically be my use in a tablet form, along with maybe drawing.  So again, and like my colleagues this is a very limited tablet relative to an Apple or Android one.

OVERALL OPINION
For my own opinion, this is a PC laptop and not much of a tablet, unless I can find Windows apps to use.  As I noted above, I did find ones for the pen. But I can’t play the games I typically play on my ipad or my Android phone, because they are not on Windows. I have heard that Microsoft is coming out with a Microsoft Surface phone that is Android based. As much as this might irk Microsoft using a competitors OS, this would address the lack of usability of this tablet.
Mind you, if you would to buy a 2 in 1 laptop of any kind it would have the same issue.

Relative to PC laptops, if I put the specs into Dell or look online, this Surface book is priced comparable to a 2 in 1 laptop, except it specs for the display are 2X what the competition offers.",
"As a Vine reviewer, I am in an interesting position – I can compare this 2019 13.5” Surface Book 2 (SB2) to its larger cousin from 2017, the 15” Surface Book 2. You might be thinking: why is it called the same thing when it’s 2 years apart? Well, it was late 2017 and early 2019, so it’s more like 1.5 years, and I guess Microsoft just wanted to do a CPU refresh and not a wholesale overhaul. So you will be able to tell which is which by the CPU – Microsoft and Amazon call them the 7th Generation Core i5 and the 8th generation models, respectively. Pay close attention to this label, as often it is the only thing distinguishing the 2019 refresh from the 2017 original.

The SB2 model I am reviewing is the 8th gen Core i5, with 8gb of RAM and a 256gb SDD storage drive. GPU duties are handled by the Intel HD620 chip, which is included on the same die as the CPU. I am comparing it to my 15” SB2, with a 7th gen Core i7 CPU, paired with an nVidia GTX1060 GPU and 16gb of RAM.

*Productivity*

The 8th gen Core i5 and 8gb of RAM are more than powerful enough to make regular PC tasks like web surfing and word processing smooth as butter. You will not bog this machine down no matter how many browser tabs you have open.

Now that we are in e-learning and zoom meetings for work, I have found that the Surface Book cameras are really terrific. They look better than everyone else's we see in our school meetings. Pen input is also really useful for school assignments, both coloring and writing.

*Gaming*

Current 3D gaming is not really feasible on this unit. By this, I mean resource-intensive games like Hitman, Injustice 2, or Batman Arkham Knight. Both Hitman and Injustice 2 had to be reduced to quite ugly settings to run, and still stuttered quite badly. Arkham Knight wouldn’t even load. So you need to manage your expectations for Intel HD620 performance. It’s not equivalent to a modern GPU (like the SB2 15” model’s nVidia GTX1060). With that said, older 3D games run fine (like Portal 2 at high resolutions, The Talos Principle at middle resolutions, and even Skyrim on slightly reduced settings), and the CPU and display perform quite nicely on games like Civilization VI, Pac-Man Championship Edition, Braid, and Pinball Arcade/Pinball FX3. So it’s not a “gaming laptop” per se, but it can do some light gaming on the side.

*Drawing*

I do a lot of drawing on my 15” Surface Book 2. It has an nVidia GPU to help with rendering speed, so any difference in performance is something I am keenly interested in. I can report happily that the drawing performance on the 8th gen 13.5” SB2 in programs like Autodesk Sketchbook, Fresh Paint, and Medibang Pro is typically excellent for Surface products. I detected no differences between this unit and my SB2 Core i7 15” model.  That’s really saying something, too. Strokes are smooth and precise, and the pressure sensing is excellent. Photoshop on the i5 model does start to bog down with large brushes, but the pen performance is still good. All Surface models perform better with the pen while plugged in - running on battery seems to reduce jitter correction.

*Build Quality*

The 3000x2000 display is truly beautiful. It is every bit the equal of the 15” display, just slightly smaller. The colors pop but are not unnatural, the blacks are inky deep and do not shift at all when viewed from off angles. The resolution provides more than enough detail for a 1080p video. It is a bit below 4k resolution, but can provide almost all of that detail as well. Text is crisp and clean with no visible stair-stepping or pixels. At full brightness, it can compete with sunny room reflections. All in all, a total home run for a 13.5 inch screen.

Audio is quite good, with two front firing speakers located on the tablet portion. It is loud enough to fill a small room if you are watching a movie or listening to music, and there is no distortion at high volumes. There isn’t a whole lot of bass response, but it doesn’t sound tinny. There must be some decent psycho-acoustics at work approximating the bass elements of a particular audio presentation.

The keyboard and track pad are arguably the best in the industry right now, equaling the Macbook’s old keyboard (and far outclassing their recent butterfly keyboards). Key travel is wonderful and satisfying, and the track pad is precise, with a good firm click, and gestures that just work.

The unit itself is admirably thin. When placed on a table, the hand can hardly feel the body of the keyboard, it is so slender. The hinge functions without a hitch, releasing the tablet and reattaching it with a satisfying click. The tablet is certainly more manageable than the 15”, but still feels kind of ridiculously large compared to an iPad or Android equivalent.

The port selection is moderate, with 2 full-size USB 3.0 plugs and a full-size SD-card slot on the left, and 1 USB-C port on the right. The headphone jack resides on the tablet, unfortunately placed on the top right.

*Battery Life*

There are two batteries in this laptop, one in the keyboard base and one in the tablet. Both batteries are listed separately in Windows 10’s tool tray battery display. I did a run-down test – watching a 1080p movie via YouTube at half brightness and half volume, some light gaming, and web browsing, and the combined battery life between the two units was quite nice – a good 9-10 hours should be easily achievable at these sorts of moderate settings. The tablet alone will only get 3-4 hours, though.

*Who is this for?*

The question you need to ask yourself is if this unit is right for you. There are better gaming laptops to be had for equivalent money, certainly. And if you just want web browsing, you can get a very nice laptop from Dell or HP for about half the price. To me, the unique selling point is the Surface Pen and flippable tablet function. Turning the tablet around and closing the lid makes this a heck of a nice drawing pad – something I use frequently, but you might not.

This 13.5” Surface Book is also quite a bit more portable than the 15”, weighing significantly less and monopolizing far less bag space. But then, it’s not as portable as the Surface Pro with keyboard cover, which performs just as well as a drawing pad. So it’s kind of in a weird spot.

If you want to game relatively seriously and draw at home, then the 8th gen 13.5” sporting a GTX1050, or the 7th gen 15” with the GTX1060 are probably better bets for you. They are way more powerful to game on, and the 15” has more surface area for drawing on the screen.

On the other hand, If you want to draw and browse on the go, then the Surface Pro is probably a better fit. I was very seriously considering buying a smaller Surface tablet to have a more portable drawing slate. The Surface tablet with a Core i5 CPU/8gb RAM/128gb storage runs for about half the price of the 8th gen SB2 at around $700. That difference will buy you a lot of accessories, such as the Surface Pen, a keyboard cover, and a nice beefy SD card to augment storage. If you go with the SB2, you get a terrific keyboard but still have to buy the pen and any additional storage.

Please don’t get me wrong – the Surface Book 2 is a whale of a laptop, in whichever iteration you choose. It’s beautifully designed, in the way that, say, Apple’s best machines are. I just kind of think these mid-range iterations are a bit underpowered for the price, and that you can easily find smaller form factors or more powerful graphical muscle for less money. As such, I think it’s a 4 star machine. If it included the Surface Pen and had more storage for the price, I could probably be persuaded to go with 5 stars.",
"UPDATED: I started the computer a few days ago and the keyboard wouldn't respond. I did some searches and found instructions to hold the power and volume up keys down for 30 seconds. Eventually the computer boots into the machine settings screen and you exit and the computer restarts. That worked the first time. Today the same thing happened, but resetting the computer didn't help, the keyboard still doesn't work. Too bad, it was a nice computer while it worked.

The Surface Book is a good choice for a dual-purpose Windows computer. It's got plenty of power for most applications, but it's not optimized for gaming. The feature I like best is the ability to un-dock the screen and use it as a tablet. The Surface Book is compact enough and light enough to carry around easily.",
"We bought this laptop for my daughter to use in college.  After a few months the keyboard broke, which they replaced.  Two years in it broke again (touchpad mouse buttons).  I took it to the store and was told it couldn’t be fixed and offered to sell me an entirely new computer!  They don’t sell just the keyboard which seems prone to breakage; I’d avoid it for that reason.",
"Touchpad in my Surface Book stopped working. It is my 3rd replacement under Microsoft Warranty. It is unbelievable that one of the most important machine defining Microsoft future becomes such a deception. Very sad indeed.  Microsoft now wants me to spend another $2,000 for a new machine because the Warranty is gone. What a lack of integrity.",
"The Surface Book 2 randomly says it has detached, without physically detaching, or even touching it. This has become a huge problem. I can be typing, and it will randomly think I have detached the tablet portion. Sometimes it will say it has been detached and re-attached 4 or 5 times in row even though it's sitting on a desk with no one touching it. Worse is, sometimes you can't even turn it on, because it won't sense the keyboard and let you type in your pin. This is the worst laptop I have ever owned, and I wish I had never bought it.",
"I got this from bestbuy but could only find a place to review this product on Amazon.

The surface book 2 worked like a dream tge first year I had it. As soon as I paid it off the pen started malfunctioning. At first it was once every few weeks. Now it's every few minutes. I've done 2 hard resets. And only have CSP installed on the computer. Tech support claimed it was the 3rd party nibs in my MS pen that were causing the problem...tiny sticks of plastic that have no computer chip. So I replaced the pen with a brand new one. The computer is functionally useless. I now have to figure out what to do since I run my entire business through my art.",
"For starters, since Amazon mixes everything together, here are the specs of the Surface Book that I'm reviewing:

Surface Book 2 13.5"" screen
8gb RAM
256gb storage
Intel Core i5-8350U CPU

Having both a 2018 Macbook Pro (from work) and this, it's easy to see that Microsoft wants to target Macbook customers. Build quality is very similar. The Surface Book feels solid and its magnesium body feels great. It's a little warmer feeling than the cold aluminum used in the Macbook. And, like the Macbook, it's beautiful. It's not as svelte as a Macbook, however, but that's just the nature of the beast. When you pack all of the electronics into the screen, it's just going to be thicker, and the clever hinge is engineered in such a way that it can hold up all that weight. It's very cool looking too - like an accordion, it cinches up on itself as you close it and expands when you open it. It makes for a thicker hinge area, though, so even though the ""clipboard"" (screen/tablet) portion just a little thicker than 1/4"", when folded over on the keyboard section (which also includes a bigger battery) it's pretty close to 1"" thick.

This Surface Book was going to be a secondary computer, as I have a big Alienware desktop that I use, but almost immediately I found that I simply enjoyed using the Surface Book much more. It's not even about portability, as I use it most often at my desk plugged into a monitor. It's that the Surface Book is fast and nimble in ways my 5 year old Alienware machine is not. I also prefer the keyboard - it's close to the great keyboards Apple used to put in the Macbooks (several years ago) and is far superior to the ""new"" low-action keyboard in the current Macbooks.

The touchpad is Apple quality, seriously. I'm shocked, actually, because I've never found any non-Apple trackpads to be particularly nice. With the gestures built into Windows, I'm pretty closely able to recreate the way I work on a Macbook trackpad.

On the left of the keyboard you'll find two USB 3 ports as well as an SD card slot. On the right is the Surface connector port and a single USB-C. The clipboard houses a single port - the headphone jack - so forget connecting a drive to the clipboard. But the Surface charger will connect directly to the clipboard, if that appeals to you. It really feels as if Microsoft doesn't *really* want you to use the clipboard by itself.

I use this computer for pretty much everything now. I'm an amateur photographer and pretty bad artist, so I use Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom a lot along with Sketchable (available in the Windows app store.) Photoshop is a demanding beast. It will take around 5 minutes to open on my Alienware box but on the Surface it opens just about as fast as on my Macbook Pro, which is around 20 seconds or so. For normal tasks like lightly editing a photo it works fine (and Lightroom equally works well for photo edits.) Some of Photoshop's complex brushes, such as the textured Kyle's brushes, push it to its limit and you'll find yourself waiting a moment for the results to catch up on screen. I don't typically use Photoshop for painting, however, and in an app like Sketchable I find that drawing and painting is fluid and extremely smooth.

But about that painting and drawing...

Microsoft seriously needs to stop being stingy. The Surface line is *always* advertised with a Surface Pen. They are meant to be together and the Surface Pen really complements the Surface. I knew going in that Surfaces don't include that great Pen, but it doesn't diminish the sting of having to buy one to get the most out of the device. Of course, you can work on the Surface just fine without one, but then it's basically just a touchscreen laptop. I don't know about you, but the appeal of the Surface for me is that I can use multiple methods of input depending on what works best at the time. It's short-sighted and cheap of Microsoft to continue making the Pen an extra charge.

That said, with the Pen, you can write and draw to your heart's desire. The Pen works beautifully, bested only by Apple's Pencil on the iPad, and they're very close in feel.

The trick to the Surface Book is that the screen, called the ""clipboard,"" can be removed. It can be used on its own, as it has a small battery inside, but you'll only get a couple hours out of it that way. The main battery is found in the keyboard base and you'll need it if you want to work on it all day. The clipboard can then be flipped around and reconnected, then closed over the keyboard. I call this ""fat tablet"" mode. It gives the screen a small slope, which is nice for drawing, but most of all it lets the keyboard battery be used. This is a great mode in which to draw or take notes. It's a little heavy to hold up like this, not surprisingly, but the clipboard battery life is significantly shorter than it is with the base.

One little thing bugs me about going into ""fat tablet"" mode. While in laptop mode, you have both an onscreen detach button (found in the ^ menu in the clock tray) as well as a detach button on the keyboard. When you've flipped the screen around, for some dumb reason, the only button that is available to detach again is the one on the keyboard, which is obviously hidden away. Why isn't the on-screen detach button available in this mode? It makes things really awkward.

Other little bits:

Speakers are actually pretty decent, with the caveat that these are, unsurprisingly, tiny speakers. They're quite loud and clear, but lack bass, which is not shocking.

The screen is beautiful. Great colors, very sharp, and the touchscreen is very responsive. Now Microsoft just has to match it with a better tablet experience in Windows.

Battery life so far has been excellent. Microsoft's blue-sky estimate of 17 hours is probably not realistic for any actual humans, but in my use so far it's easily enough battery for going all day without a charger, unless you're going heavy on the Photoshop where you'll need to boost the battery for ""best performance"" (or else Photoshop performance will be seriously hindered.) The charger is the typical Surface charger with the proprietary magnetic connector, and the separate housing for the charger includes a USB for charging other devices. Makes you wonder why Microsoft couldn't just include a dock that could connect to your monitor and other devices, doesn't it?

All said and done, I really enjoy this computer. It's not cheap, I know, and I know you can find faster computers for less, but they also feel like ""less."" It's important to know what you really want and need out of a computer. For me, I wanted Macbook-like build quality and I've got that here. I also own a Surface Pro 1 that is nearing 6 years old and it still works great, so I have had good experiences with Microsoft devices. I have read of some issues on Surface Books but mine so far has worked flawlessly, and I hope I don't have to change that - but if something happens, I'll definitely update this review to reflect that.",
"The New Microsoft Surface Book 2 15"" (Intel Core i5, 16GB RAM, 256GB) is fantastic! It replaces my Surface Book 1 with the  smaller 13.5” screen. One of the things that I love about it, is that I can detach and reverse the screen (so the keyboard is not in the way, and the touch screen is closer) and then use the dock (sold separately) with my two other 30-inch monitors (which can be split between them) to effectively have five screens from a single laptop. The keyboard is backlit, and now has a USB-C connection. It is super fast. It’s also perfect as a little movie theater for travel. Set-up was a breeze. The only consideration is that it is a little heavier, which is to be expected with a bigger screen. If you think the specifications will fit your needs, then you will probably be very happy with this machine. Note that the pen is sold separately, but I don’t need the pen much myself.",
"Battery is melting inside. It started bulging about a year after I bought it, I thought batery just gets warm and deforms plastic. But it is actually battery itself bulging and deforming. this morning I noticed the bottom is all opened up. It is a piece of ... computer. I paid for it as much as I could've paid for apple. But I was hoping Microsoft went too far ahead from my 90's last computer... not really, they are deeper in a hole now. I've had all kind of problems with it ever since I bought this damn thing and the microsoft store wouldn't do anything, all they do is pay lip service and try to get rid of you, they do not want to take this ""product"" back. I was stuck with this thing. I should've gotten apple to replace my old apple. This melting ""computer"" if I can call it like that is now DANGEROUS because of the melting battery. save your money and trouble, get something better than this piece of ...",
"I have a high quality less than one year old 15"" laptop that I don't use because it always takes so much time to open & always requests updates that take forever. I have had tech savvy family members look at it and it always reverts back to it's sluggishness. I have an iPad, but I don't use that because I have never been a fan of ""gasp!"" Apple products and because using the iPad actually makes me dizzy! I was excited to be able to order this Surface Book. I FREAKING LOVE THIS SURFACE BOOK! It boots up lightening fast, it doesn't make me dizzy using it, everything about using it is intuitive to me. The battery life is amazing! It has done an update already; completed in less than a minute! This thing ROCKS, it works, it does everything it is supposed to and without glitches! Oh, and it looks hot as heck!",
"This laptop is an excellent iteration in the Surface Book series. We also have a Surface Pro, which is also an excellent computer.  The Surface Book 2 is more powerful but also a lot heavier and bulky than the Surface Pro.  Still, considering the power, responsiveness, and versatility, it it rather light.  The touch screen is surprising useful and very responsive and precise.  The screen color and brightness are excellent, with videos and photos jumping out at you.  The screen is detachable/reversible, which is consuming media content.

The Surface Book 2 is also more snappy and has a better screen than our new 2019 MacBook Pro.  While the MacBook Pro has kept the same confined design for years, Microsoft has stepped out and created an innovative, useful, functional laptop with lots of speed and zip.  Our new favorite laptop!  The Surface line is amazing.",
"I never write reviews, but I was so disappointed and I don't want anyone else to make the same mistake I did.  I traded in my Macbook Air for this computer and I honestly wish I had saved my money and kept my Mac.  I've had this Surface Book 2 for just about a year and it's working slower than my Mac, which I had for 3 years.  The touch screen is nice and it's cool that it turns into a tablet, but it works so incredibly slow that I cannot open Word and Chrome at the same time because it will crash and turn off.  I am a student, so I mainly use my laptop to do research, write papers, and take notes.  The tablet was a good feature to take notes on, but the processing speed is so slow that it is not worth it.  I take very good care of my computer and it has never been dropped so I don't know why it is acting the way it is, but I was told it would be comparable to my Mac and it is definitely not.",
"This is intended to be the best of both worlds - part tablet PC and part laptop. Unfortunately, the result is that it doesn't do a very good job of either.

Tablet features: The screen can un-dock from the keyboard, and re-dock in reverse to make using it as a tablet a bit easier. But the screen is so bulky, that I rarely actually use it as a tablet. I wouldn't think of walking around with just the screen (due to size), and reversing it in a meeting to make note-taking easier is awkward. It is a beautiful touch-screen, but since I use it mostly as a laptop, I rarely use it. The Microsoft Stylus is probably the best on the market - but it costs quite a bit extra.

Laptop features: This is almost as good as a standard laptop. Except that the monitor opens only a little wider than a 90-degree angle. So if you actually want to use it on your lap or on a plane, you may be frustrated.

In my opinion, you'll be better served purchasing a standard laptop and/or tablet. Or, if you're looking at a slightly better compromise, consider something like the Yoga or possibly the Surface Pro.",
"Honestly, this has been a great device for just over three years. Three years being the limit for their responsibility.

That is the issue though. Last week I noticed that my touch screen was acting weird. On top of that, my batteries began to die very quickly. This week I noticed that the laptop wouldn't close all the way. On closer inspection today, I can see now that My screen is bulging out. The entire top part of my surface book has begun expanding. There are multiple pressure points around the edges of the display and even the metal frame is warped like some sick smile (very noticeably the entire top of the frame is curved).

So I have had this device just over three years, and because I was a little too late to call them I'm out of luck. This is a known issue with this device and several other surface devices. Do a quick search for ""surface battery swelling"" if you would like. Instead of letting owners know about the potential fire hazard stored in their homes/car/office, they've hidden this info so as to prevent as many as possible from getting it fixed. I cannot afford a new device right now... especially not with both mine and my wife's hours being reduced due to Covid-19.

I called support to see if they could do anything for me and they were willing to send me a refurbished device for $600+tax. When I explained that I couldn't afford that I was told that there were other options I could explore online. I asked where to do that and was directed to Microsoft's home page. I asked for clarification because I was still under the impression this person was trying to help me. They told me to click ""Surface"" in the menu at the top of the screen. I did and it took me to the sales page for their surface line. ""There are lots of options here"" they told me. How in the hell are these ""options"" if I cannot afford the $600 fee for your defective battery?!

Needless to say I am pissed. My device is in mint condition but I missed the cutoff by a couple weeks for this known and potentially dangerous issue. Microsoft support has washed their hands of me and sent me off with a big middle finger to purchase a new device.",
"There’s some great and accurate reviews on this machine that will tell you all the specs and performance issues with this Surface Book. Thinking this might be a good option for my occasional forays into the PC world as I spend a lot of time in the Mac world, I thought I’d give this a try. I’ve been using it for a few weeks now and have tried my best to be objective about it. But I’ve been really frustrated, actually.

The video glitches all the time and just can’t keep up with basic stuff. I have connection issues with WiFi. It glitches with photo editing. And what drives me crazy is that it’s constantly updating. It’s much heavier than a laptop and, separated, it’s heavier than a pad. It’s dead weight lugging it around. If it were worth it, performance wise, I’d be less bothered by the weight.

I seriously should have gone with a lighter, better performing and less expensive laptop. I was hoping for a better overall experience but this just isn’t my thing. I tried but it’s going to stay at home from now on.",
"The Surfacebook 2 is a marvel of engineering. The concept is wonderful and for a while it worked great. You can detach the screen which contains the hard drive, processor, and memory. The keyboard supplies an extra battery and a graphics card.

After the warranty ran out, I began to experience random shutdowns related to the battery either discharging quickly or not being detected properly. These shutdowns could happen in the middle of a work remote call or while playing graphically intense games. Microsoft has not owned up to this problem, instead they recommend bringing the device in to a Microsoft store for a pricy fix.

I do not recommend this device. The screen is still too heavy and large to use as a tablet. It is an excellent drawing surface, though.",
"The Surface Book Pro is a great versatile product with a great look and form factor. The detachable display to use as a tablet is an added bonus. The ability to reverse as reattach the display and fold completely open is a great way to use it as a tablet with all the extra ports on the base unit.

The only downside so far is the slow WiFi; but that is fixable by changing the TXAMSDU setting in the registry. I have also encountered some issues with a Bluetooth barcode scanner disconnecting and requiring turning Bluetooth off/on to get working again.

All-in-all it is great product from Microsoft.",
"I have really been enjoying the surface book. I find the battery life to last all day and when it does need a charge, it charges quickly and I am back in action. I am coming from a MacBook and I LOVE the touch screen. I find it so portable that fits in most of my handbags. So easy to travel with and use on the airplane. When I used my MacBook, the screen would hit the seat in front of me.

One reason I chose this computer is I wanted to be able to not carry two devises, my laptop and my iPad. This does the trick, now instead of a bag of electronics I have one devise. That in itself is best part of it. Light, portable and so easy to use.

I just bought the pen as well. That is a great accessory for this devise! I love to doodle with it. On the flip side it runs my high level spreadsheets with speed!",
"So my only complaint about Microsoft devices as a whole is their lack of compatibility with Linux.  This one is better than the other 4 I have owned.  It still isn't working well with CentOS, but Kubuntu works awesomely, and I also have Kali running.  I've got a tripple boot (with Windows as well) set up, and the whole thing took about 5 hours to set up.  If you're looking for a laptop to run Linux on, that is light and has a great battery, the choice is this one or the XPS.  The XPS (my friend has one) doesn't run touchscreen, but it is lighter than this one and gets even better battery...

Overall, this laptop has a great battery, a great screen, and runs Linux with very little effort.  The only downsides are the requirement to have power connected in order to detach the screen (yes, the button does work in Linux), the fact that all ports (USB, SD and charging included) are on the base (so in tablet mode it can't charge, can't read an SD card, and can't use a USB device), and the fact that it is so sealed that you can't upgrade or repair it yourself.  Those are the reasons I dropped one star (personally, I'd drop 4 stars for all that, but I know most people wouldn't).",
"The hardware is stylish, compact, and polished. The hinge is unique. The display is gorgeous. Keyboard and the touchpad are comfortable and work well.

Intel i5 model with 8Gb RAM model is ok for basic tasks and picture editing but video editing and speech recognition sputter. For those tasks, the i7 model with 16Gb RAM will work smoother.

It works very well as a tablet - Surface pen draws better than Apple pencil on iPad Pro. The tablet does not feel heavy - to me, Google Slate felt bulkier.

There are some glitches - when you snap the tablet back to the keyboard, the pointer does not come back. I had to restart the computer.

I like it better than my other tablets/laptops - HP Spectre, MacBook, i5 Google Slate and for drawing better than iPad Pro. It is an expensive 2-in1 Laptop/Tablet combo. More expensive than all of those devices except for HP Spectre 13 inches i7 laptop.",
"After using Surface Pro at work for a few months, I was hooked as I found it light and portable and great as a fully functional laptop and tablet. The keyboard is pretty great too. The Surface Book seemed like an even better laptop replacement but it's a lot heavier. It's pretty versatile as a tablet and a laptop. I purchased a Surface Pen separately to try drawing on it. It works pretty nicely with all the sketching apps, but I do like the Apple Pencil on the iPad Pro 13 inch or iPad 11 inch just a tiny bit more.

The screen is clear and bright and the laptop version is fast enough for most apps. It can be nice for watching TV in bed or on the go. I just did not expect it to be so much heavier than the Surface Pro. I had envisioned this one as a lighter laptop but it's actually heavier than my other 15 inch laptop. At this point, I am not using it very much due to the heavier weight, that's a shame.",
"First, there seems to be some question as to what generation i5 processor is in this model.  It is an 8th generation processor.  I already have a Surface Tablet with the 7th generation i7 in it and I can’t tell any noticeable difference even though this in an i5 instead of the previous generation i7.  My tablet also has 16gb of RAM whereas this “Book” only has 8gb.  Again I have yet to have a problem while running any programs including Adobe CS and third party filters.  I am very impressed with the overall feel of the unit.  I have heard some people express concerns with the keyboards ability to hold up under heavy use.  However, it seems pretty good and the feel of the keys is near perfect to me.  I usually take very good care of my computers so I doubt if I will ever have a problem with it.  However if you are looking for something along the lines of mil-spec hardware built to take anything you can do to it then of course this is not it.  The 13.5 inch screen is bigger than the tablet I have gotten use to using.  On the other hand this PC is much smaller and lighter than my current laptop and that is a good thing.  I ordered a leather case for it and even with that is will be a laptop I would not think twice about taking on the road, which I never do with my big 15 inch laptop.  If I want I can also easily detach the screen from the keyboard and use it as a touch screen only tablet.  I never put much stock in advertised battery run time since so much depends on how each person uses their PC and actual run time can differ significantly between users.  I can say already though that it seems to run significantly longer than my old Surface Tablet and I am happy about that.  I certainly do recommend this laptop.  If you can afford it I would still suggest you max out the processor, RAM, and storage if you feel you may have need of something more powerful.  But if you don’t plan on using it for heavy gaming or other power hungry stuff then the i5 with 8gb RAM should suffice.",
"This surface book is an extremely great device to have. First thing I would say is this is a great laptop. It is a bit on the thicker side compared to many other laptops but with the amount of power it has I see no issues with it. It uses the traditional power brick charger as the surface pro 4 however the actual brick is a bit bigger than usual. The surface is very quick on boot up and does have facial unlock. One of the things I would say about this is that in order to charge it you actually need to have it plugged into the dock and keyboard. You cannot charge the tablet separate from the actual dock. The dock/keyboard itself has its own battery as well as the tablet. You can easily charge the keyboard and dock while using the tablet. I would be careful on how far back you push the screen as the hinge will only go back so far. I would say from the 90 degree it can move back an additional 15 degrees back before it stops. Do not force the tablet screen back any further or you will break it. Another thing is if you are planning to use this on you lap, be careful when opening and closing as the hinge has gaps that your hair or skin can get caught in if you have it on your skin. The external surface is very easy to scratch so I would recommend that you get a skin to protect it or get a laptop case for it. The tablet itself is locked to the keyboard and the only way to remove it is to either detach it in windows or just press the detach button on the top right. It does take a few seconds but you will know it is safe to remove when you hear a click. The tablet can be rotated around and put back into the dock and closed. This makes it nice to turn into a tablet as well as protecting your keyboard. The touch screen is super sensitive as well as accurate. It does not come with a pen however if you are an artist or writer then I would recommend getting one. The facial recognition is great and makes it easy for me to unlock my laptop without needing to type in the pin. There is a front and back camera that will record at at least 720p. I would not really record an event with the camera however it is nice to know you have that option. The microphone also is very clear and I have not had any issues with any sound issues. It usually does not pick up surrounding noise and focuses more on voice. On the tablet itself, there is a 3.5 port to plug in headphones/microphone. It does have dual band wifi built in and no issues with speed.

The tablet itself can last about six to eight hours on its own and an additional eight or so hours plugged into the dock. The overall charge time depends but it can take up to a full night to charge both the tablet and the dock to 100% from what I can tell. Normally a full night will last me until dinner time the next day which is pretty good, but you can probably shave the time off with adjusting brightness. One minor complaint about this product is that it arrives 100% battery drained. So if you have this device and it does not power on then just leave it plugged in for 30 minutes to an hour and try again. It has a really fast boot up being less than ten seconds to boot up and it can be set to automatically scan and detect your fast to unlock. There is 8 gb of ram which is pretty standard for most laptops nowadays that work well with most of the application. There is really no lag between application. There is also plenty of storage space however I would recommend to just use an external hard drive to store pictures and videos as 256 gb will run out pretty fast. It has two USB 3.0 ports on the left side as well as a type c on the left next to the charging port. The transfer speed is quick depending on the usb device you have. There is no usb port on the actual tablet itself unfortunately. The speaker system is pretty loud and the heat from this unit is not bad. It does get warm on the tablet and the keyboard when it is in use but that is normal. The edges of the keyboard are slightly slanted down and there is a magnet on the tablet top and the bottom of the keyboard to secure the book closed. The processor is an i5 which is good enough power for what I need it to do. It can play some games but i would say not at the best quality but it can play some at low settings. The processing speed is really fast and it works really well for what I need. You can connect this to a dock or monitor however you will need a type c to hdmi or a usb 3.0 to hdmi adapter to get the video output. It can handle two screens if you have the right adapter at pretty good resolution. Overall this is a great laptop to have and I would suggest you to get this surface book if you want something that is powerful but still have the tablet option.",
"Right off the bat let me say I really love this Surface Book 2. It's the best laptop I've ever had, and I've had quite a few. It has entirely cured my latent MacBook Pro envy, to the point where some of my coworkers now have Surface Book2 envy. That said, this is only possible because I run Linux on the machine instead of Windows 10, and not without some issues. Allow me to summarize:

The Good
========
1. You can run Linux Ubuntu 19.10 on this machine with nearly full support
2. Laptop size, weight, screen resolution - all top notch
3. Carrying this thing around, you will be super cool
4. Touchpad, touchscreen, detachable screen, wifi, audio, etc. all work great
5. Battery lasts all day
6. USB-C port drives monitor and charges laptop battery simultaneously

The Bad
========
1. You must install one specific patched version of the Linux kernel
2. The built-in camera won't work under Linux

The Ugly
========
1. You need to keep a dual-boot system running Win10, for firmware updates
2. Bluetooth support is, well, meh

To clarify, here are some specific observations:

The Kernel! First of all, this machine only runs Linux as well as it does thanks to the hard work of the guys who put together the ""jakeday surface linux"" repository on Github. Google it, follow the simple instructions, and all will work well. But this patch-set only runs on Linux Kernel version 5.1.15, which is now, i.e. 10NOV2019, somewhat behind the latest Ubuntu 19.10 (5.3.0-19) distribution. Doubtless it will get updated at some point, but as of this writing it hasn't been updated in five months.

Ubuntu! You're pretty much stuck with using the Ubuntu distro. Some intrepid hackers have forked the jakeday patches for ArchOS - good luck with that. Or if you prefer jakeday gives instructions for building on any Debian-based system - again, good luck, because the base linux kernel repository no longer goes back to stable version 5.1.15, meh. As a side note, hitherto I was a Linux ""Mint"" user, so the switch to native Ubuntu has been an adventure.

The camera, blech! Forget it, the patches will not get the camera working. I have a cheap external camera I use for video conferencing when necessary. Someday maybe someone will get this patched, but I wouldn't hold my breath.

Bluetooth! It works, don't get me wrong, but it's flaky. Sometimes I have to reload the bluetooth drivers to get devices to work right.

Dual boot! If you want to do firmware upgrades you need to keep Windows 10 installed on a partition, as a dual-boot option. No one I've found knows how to update the firmware outside of Win10. This wastes about 50GB of the precious 250GB SSD drive space.

Fast, fast, fast! Geekbench4 clocks this thing at 4662 single-core and 11449 multi-core. It's the fastest machine in my office, running our Cypress test suite half again faster than anyone else. I'll post the geekbench4 link in a comment.

Wifi, touchpad, touchscreen, detachable screen, wifi, audio, sdcard, USB-C dock! All that stuff works great. Touch-Ubuntu is fun to play with, but to be honest I never use it. I'm more of a full-stack software engineer than a casual note-taker.

USB-C Docking Bay! One Single-Cable Connection! I use the SB2 to drive a gorgeous 38"" ultra wide Dell monitor at 3840x1600 resolution. This is with the simple Intel video chipset and not the special Nvidia version. At the same time the SB2 is driving the Dell monitor through the USB-C port, the Dell monitor is charging the SB2 battery through the same cable. This means all I have to do is set my laptop down on my desk, attach one single USB-C cable, and I'm done. All connected, no power, no nothing else. One wire. The Holy Grail has finally been attained - this is the setup they'll hand out at orientation in Heaven.

Retinal Display! The resolution of the internal laptop display is 3240x2160. The Intel chip can drive it simultaneously with my external 3840x1600 display, as a dual-monitor setup. This works fine, but unless you have a magnifying-glass vision you'll want to configure Ubuntu to drive the laptop display at a scaling level of 150% or higher. This is a simple button-click GUI operation, so no worries.

tldr; get this laptop, set it up for dual-boot to Ubuntu 19.10 running the ""jakeday surface linux"" kernel. Apart from the camera everything will work, and you'll be the envy of all your friends.",
"Disclaimer: I walked away from Windows years ago and jumped to the Mac world. This is my first venture back.

Cosmetically, it's a good looking unit. Built sturdy. Seems durable. The screen is big and bright and appears to be very sharp when viewing photos or videos. And the thing seems quite fast. Web pages load quickly (I did testing without the built in apps so I used Chrome and other third party software) and overall setup was pretty easy. Although I've been away from Windows for almost eight years the environment hasn't changed that much and I was pretty much at home pretty quickly. I even found my way out to DOS (you remember DOS, right?) without any issues.

But I really don't like the keyboard. I do a lot of writing that ranges from the typical email to editing a non-profit's monthly newsletter and everything in between. I tried to like this keyboard. I couldn't. Things just seemed to be just slightly in the wrong place. I don't think I'd enjoy working on this one for any length of time.

The big feature of this device seems to be the screen that detaches and can serve as a tablet. I can see where that would come in handy since I use my iPod for things like client demos and when I head out to hang in coffee shops. I'm not sure I'd do that with this screen. First, it's a bit large and ungainly. While the size is nice for those of us with aging eyes, it just doesn't seem comfortable in my hand and I have the overwhelming fear that I'm going to drop the thing. But that's not my biggest issue with it. All of the ports are on the keyboard. I couldn't, as an example, take this with me to a meeting and charge it if the meeting ran long. If I was going away for a weekend I'd need to take the whole kit with me. If you're looking for the convenience of a tablet this might not fit the bill.

So I'm still playing with it. I picked it up because I still have friends and relatives using Windows and I've been out of practice when it comes to answering their questions. I thought it might be fun to test the waters after all these years. It was amusing, but maybe not fun. If you can get your hands on one for testing I'd make a strong suggestion that you do that before you commit to making this your main machine.",
"We have a number of surface tablets in our house, and this was my first surface book. I got it hoping for some increased performance for using with my landscape CAD program, and I did notice a difference in the smoothness when working with CAD on this device as opposed to my other comparable surface tablets. The better performance only works when it is hooked up to the keyboard, which is fine for CAD work.

I also like to use this as a tablet for photo editing work related to my business, and here I noticed my number one complaint about this device, which is that the tablet part itself does not have the little foldout stand that all of the other surface tablets have. I guess they think that you will just connect it to the keyboard, but sometimes I want it to be as flexible and lightweight as a regular surface Pro tablet, and while you can unhook it from the keyboard and use it as a tablet, it feels more bulky and the lack of stand makes it less flexible in its use than the surface Pro tablets.

One thing I did notice is that you can connect it to the keyboard backwards and use the keyboard as a stand that way, however that does not bend to the same angle as the tablet stands do on a regular surface Pro.

I also think that the battery life is a lot less on this one than on the surface Pro tablets. Even when not connected to the keyboard and the increased computing performance that you get from that, it seems to wear down its batteries on tablet mode in about 30 to 45 minutes of photo editing. When I worked on my surface tablet in this fashion, I feel like I got a little less than two hours before having to recharge.

Overall, if you plan to use this primarily plugged in as a laptop and only occasionally as a tablet, the increased performance from the attached keyboard make this a worthwhile choice if you do gaming or more high-powered computing. However, if you are primarily using it as a tablet or in places where battery life is a critical consideration, I would suggest the regular surface Pro tablet instead.

In terms of accessories, I use the surface pen constantly, but haven't reached for the other accessories much at all. The surface pen makes it so smooth to make notes on photographs to convey ideas to people, and is great for photo editing.",
I thought this was a great idea at first.  It updates when it wants to.  It downloads gigabytes for each download stealing your hard drive space.  It seems like every time I have an important job to do in a hurry this thing is automatically updating.  I made modifications in the code to stop updates well they updated and removed my modifications.  It is also a spy machine.  It uploads everything to Microsoft.  Why do they want my kids pictures all of my files it sends an image of the entire operating system.  I do my taxes on it and fill out PDFs with private information it just uploads everything and you cannot stop it.  I even tried putting this thing on airplane mode so it can stop downloading gigs worth of updates.  That does not work.  The thing will slow down what I’m doing so it can download gigs worth of information as well as upload gigs of info.  This is crazy. This is the worst investment ever.  If they are going to rely on my information to make money why isn’t this thing free?  So u charge me 2 grand for the thing to spy on me then you make even more money with my info.  Stay away.  Also it downloads stuff On it’s own my desktop always has some new game some new program they want me to try.  Why are they downloading stuff in my computer.  The privacy policy is tricky and I studied law.  It links you to places with broken links.  It wants you to login and the information is in so many different websites it’s ridiculous.  If I could get my money back I would.  It also has a tablet mode that is useless.  You go in tablet mode and everything disappears? What? It could have been alright if it never had windows 10 and their spyware. If you buy this make sure you get the one that has a huge hard drive and get huge SD cards.  The updates will eat up all your space mine is full am using it because I had an extra sd card good luck giving away your privacy to someone who is selling it.,
"Overall: The newest surface is a phenomenal product and it keeps improving every year. The screen quality is truly impressive and this is a tablet/laptop is a generous size to easily accomplish goals and multi-task. The computer is very fast and easily processes your multi-tasking. There are a few minor things that made it slightly less enjoyable but these did not detract much from my enjoyment of the system. The computer is really a powerhouse or beast of a system and replaces the need to have both a laptop and a tablet. This makes it a very convenient choice for professionals because it showcases presentations but can also be used personally.

Pros: The screen is absolutely gorgeous and that is one of the best features. It is perfect for streaming movies/TV shows, checking emails, playing games, etc.  It is also easy to switch into work mode and get a lot accomplished on Microsoft Office products / Adobe / Internet (Chrome).  It runs multiple applications very well with it’s 16 GB memory and has a lightning-fast processor for most basic tasks of the common user.  Even when doing a lot of processing, the computer runs quiet and does not run hot which are important features. It’s fairly easy to switch between tablet and laptop mode just by clicking it in and out.  There is a button that shows the eject on the keyboard.  You will then be prompted on whether or not you would like it to be in tablet mode or stay in tablet mode. Another amazing advantage is the battery life. It easily lasts twice as long as a standard laptop and I’ve gotten very long life spans out of it as it easily makes it past 15 hours.

Cons: One strange thing that I noticed is that when the battery is low, it will not allow me to detach the tablet from the keyboard.  This is unusual because I can charge it either on the keyboard or on the tablet directly. It’s surprisingly heavy for a tablet, due to it packing a lot of processing power.  It is noticeably harder to manipulate in the hand compared to more standard tablets when using it in tablet mode. Also, while the product page shows some of the connected devices like the pen, wireless mouse, etc. it does not come with any of those so they must be ordered separately. It only arrives with the keyboard stand.  Another aspect that I have noticed is that on occasion it glitches in tablet mode and the keyboard does not pop up when I am filling out forms or attempting to type.
Bottom Line-  It is a wonderful choice and you really are getting the definition of versatile.",
"Let me start off by stating this is not your typical Surface.  The Microsoft Surface is a tablet, which may or may not include with it some sort of soft felt/leathery keyboard connected to the tablet via bluetooth.  The tablet also has a kick stand that helps it stay upright.

The Surface Book is a laptop.  It opens/closes and feels like your typical laptop.  But it's not your typical laptop.  With the touch of a button, the Tablet screen detaches from the solid, back-lit keyboard.

How does this work?  The connection is maintained by what feels like two electromagnetic tabs which embed into the Tablet screen about 10-15mm.  There are also 3 multi-pin connections which I suspect provide power, video, and USB connection to/from the keyboard section.  These are all hidden when the Tablet is docked to the keyboard.  The keyboard section provides the Tablet with a second battery, two 'standard' USB 2.0 ports, one SD Card Slot, one USB Type-C slot and a power slot.
Here's a few random notes on the keyboard: the keyboard section feels like it actually weighs more than the Tablet when separated.  The button to release the Tablet looks like a standard key on the keyboard, next to the Del key, above the backspace.  The hinge is also unique in that it's like a C-shape.  The laptop won't close at a perfectly straight angle like most laptops.  Despite this fact, there don't seem to be any weak points in the hinge.  I personally would think that the weak points are the shallow tabs that connect the keyboard and Tablet together.  They don't seem big enough to withstand a whole lot of tug/pull, so I am careful not to handle it too rough.

The Tablet is amazing.  When detached from the keyboard, it is lightweight and ultra-responsive.  It responds very well to third-party 'electric' pens that allow me to create hand-drawn designs just as if it were pencil/paper.  However, there are a couple of notes to this design:
There is a single port on the tablet.  However, instead of going with the industry standard USB Type-C connection, Microsoft decided to go with its own weird connection.  It is the same connection which is used to provide power to the Keyboard.  Thus, the same power cable used to power/charge the Keyboard also charges/powers the Tablet.  I also read that there are data cables that convert this weird connection to USB Type-C, which theoretically could provide data transfer ability AND power straight to/from the Tablet (without the Keyboard).  However, I don't know if the port on the Tablet will allow video/data to go in/out without the Keyboard attached.  The cable descriptions state ""Doesn't support data transfer or video output, only be used for charging your Surface.""  You can search ""Surface Connect to USB-C Charging Cable"" on Amazon if you are curious.

Despite its few drawbacks, as long as you view this as a laptop that turns into a Tablet instead of a Tablet which turns into a laptop, you won't be disappointed.",
"The Surface Book 2 with an i5 8250U processor is the third Surface Book I've owned. I had an original i7 with a dGPU, a Surface Book 2 i7 with a dGPU, and now this i5 8250U without a dGPU. (If you're curious, I returned the SB2 i7 because the screen weight made it too wobbly.)

The first thing I noticed after installing all of the patches available, was how zippy the system was. I've stuck with i7 CPU's for the past few years, because you can ""feel"" how slow the i5's are by comparison. In this iteration of the Surface Book 2, the i5 8250U mostly (MOSTLY!) seems to give the i7 8650U in my ThinkPad Yoga X1 a run for its money.

Once you really start to put it through its paces, you'll start to notice that it isn't quite a modern i7. But to that end, I'm talking about moving large projects back and forth in Photoshop and Lightroom, or rendering video. For the vast majority of average use, you probably wouldn't notice the difference between the two processors -- except the Surface Book 2 doesn't give you the same kind of fan noise you'd get on a ThinkPad Yoga with an i7.

As for the rest of the system, it's just about everything you've probably read about Surface Books. The display is gorgeous, and has a wonderful aspect ratio for getting things done. When it comes to 15"" laptops, I can't think of a single one where I'd say the display is universally better than what you'll get in a Surface Book 2.

Similarly, the Surface Book 2 offers some of the cleanest sound I've experienced in a non-gaming laptop, and despite what ThinkPad purists may say, the keyboard is as good or better than just about any ThinkPad Lenovo has made in the past 4 - 5 years.  (Oh, W520... how I miss your awe-inspiring keyboard...) And of course, you get all the benefits of a display than can be detached and / or flipped, though I think the 15"" model is a bit big for using as a tablet for extended use. Pair it up with a Surface Pen (or Wacom Bamboo Ink, if money's really tight) and you've got a lovely setup for art, sketching, and document markup.

It's a lovely machine, but I wouldn't buy it. And here's why:

As of summer 2019 when I'm writing this, this specific i5 model is kind of like a Surface Book 2.5, since it was recently updated. Yet, Microsoft still hasn't quite figured out how to make the hinge stronger or display lighter, such that it doesn't wobble incessantly if you're a... ""spirited"" typist. Frankly, I was disappointed to see that this hadn't been addressed, as it's been a known problem for going on two years.

Second, unless you absolutely must have a detachable screen and can't come up with the money for a dGPU model, this is a pretty awful value. You could save tons of money on a Surface Laptop 2, if you're just using this as a laptop and don't have very specific criteria.

Third, holy wow, is this heavy. I hadn't realized how spoiled I was with my ThinkPad Yoga X1, or even my regular Surface Pro 5. You're almost certainly going to want / need a decent laptop bag for this, which is probably going to annoy anyone who hasn't moved towards laptop folios for going back and forth between home and work / school.

So, it's not that this is a bad laptop. It definitely isn't. But unless you have a perfect combination of needs and available cash that has you looking at the i5 without dGPU, I'd either put more money toward a dGPU model, or consider a different model like the Surface Laptop 2, Surface Pro with a keyboard cover, or a convertible like the Lenovo X1 Yoga or Dell XPS 2-in-1 series.",
"This is a hybrid computer that can be used as a laptop or a tablet. The external dimensions of the computer are 13.5”x10”x1”; the device weighs 3.8 lbs. Actual screen dimensions are 12.5”x8.5”. The keyboard has a standard Windows layout with no numeric keypad. Below the keyboard is a touchpad. The screen can be detached from the keyboard and used as a tablet since it is a touchscreen. The battery is integrated with the screen and is not removable. The battery takes a complete charge in a few hours and is rated to last up to 17 hours. On the left edge of the keyboard are 2 USB A ports and an SD card slot. On the right edge are 1 USB C port and a charging port. Power and volume buttons are on the top edge of screen. There is a front camera with microphone at the front center of the screen and a rear camera in the top corner. The computer comes with a charging transformer and cable; all other accessories like a stylus are sold separately.

The processor is an Intel i5-8350U running at 1.7Gh. The device comes with 16 Gb RAM installed. The hard drive is solid state with 238 Gb of useable space. Both the screen and keyboard are sealed, so the memory and hard drives cannot be upgraded or replaced after purchase.

I am very pleased with how this device works for portable computing. It boots up quickly, the keyboard is smooth and easy to type on, and the ability to detach the screen and use it as a large format tablet is really slick. The screen has a very clear display, and the touchscreen is quite responsive. Unlike many other laptops that I have tried, the 16 Gb of installed RAM means Windows and applications run quite well without getting bogged down. The SSD hard drive is also much faster than you would get with a mechanical drive. On the other hand, the Intel i5-8350U processor is not screaming fast, so this is no high-powered gaming machine. Still, for most professional office or student purposes, this computer will do just fine. The 238 Gb hard drive is big enough for creating and storing office documents. But if you do media-heavy creative work (like serious photography), you would probably want to store your media on an external drive rather than the small drive that comes with this machine. The computer comes preloaded with Win10 and Microsoft Edge (browser). If you want to use other Microsoft software (like Office, Word, Excel, Powerpoint, etc) on this computer, you either need to purchase a subscription or purchase the software outright. (There is no optical drive on this computer, but you can connect an external optical drive, sold separately, if you wish).

The only design issue that I have found with this device is the location of the ports. I find an external mouse much more comfortable to use than a touchpad. But the USB A ports on this device are both on the left side. So my right-handed mouse cord has to snake around the back of the machine. Meanwhile, my external hard drive has a USB C cable, so it needs to get connected to the right side of the machine, where it gets tangled up with the mouse cable. If only the USB C port was on the left and there was a USB A port on the right. Or…if the ports had just been on opposite sides, with USB C and charging on the left, and USB A and SD card on the right, cabling would have been so much simpler!

These minor design quibbles aside, this device is excellent for mobile computing. The battery seems to last forever—all day and the next as well. The screen is beautiful, and the computer has enough RAM to support Windows 10 running multiple applications at once.",
"I want to point out the difference!  Because, not long ago, detaching the screen or monitor from your computer or laptop meant that the screen or monitor turned into a tablet that only worked with apps.  That is NOT what's going on here!  I'd guess that this is not news to most who have grown up with the latest and greatest in technology.  But for others, who are more isolated from what's new, this might cause some confusion.

I got this Surface Book--a laptop with a detachable screen--because I wanted to run Corel software on the detached screen.  Programs such as Painter, PaintShop, CorelDraw and more, install, load and run smoothly on this Surface Book.  Removed from the base with the keyboard, I can draw right on my lap, or flat on a table.  Turn the screen around, attached but facing away from the keyboard, I can draw on an angle, on a slight incline.  I can use the Surface pen with my Corel programs, too.

While I fully appreciate, and am somewhat in awe of, the fact that sophisticated, large and intricate programs run quickly and smoothly on this screen--apart from its mother board--I have noticed just two things that prevent me from awarding this a 5-star rating:
--It runs hot.  While I want to hold it on my lap, the heat makes it uncomfortable to do so.  The heat is distracting, too.
--The screen does not hold its position firmly.  Put a bit of pressure on the screen and you'll lose your angle.

The touch screen is sensitive.  I suppose that is both a positive and a negative.  The Surface Pen does not come included, but it is a worthwhile--almost necessary add-on.  So, for the price point of this Surface Book, I'd think they could include it in the package.  The pen is magnetized and will attach itself to the Book, but I don't ever count on it staying in place.

Battery life is good.  I do appreciate the magnetized ""plug-in"" to the base.

Screen color is bright and sharp.  No complaints there.  It provides pretty, pretty visuals.

I hate the Microsoft eye recognition.  Sometimes I wear glasses, sometimes I don't.  If you want to utilize the eye recognition feature, make sure your glasses are either always on or always off.  I'm glad to say that you don't need to use the eye recognition if you don't want to--it is a preference that you can turn off.  But logging into Microsoft, which is a choice on other makes of computers and laptops, is not a choice here.  You must have a log-in or a Pin to gain access to your Book.",
"It was damaged . The item
Has been returned . It was not a good experience",
"Zero stars. Do not take this lightly.
It may seem perfect in your first month or two, but wait until you reach the 6mo. mark.",
"Screen isn't that responsive to my stylus. I brought it to be an art table so it useless to me. 1700 dollars, just to be not as good as my Android tablet.",
Portabilty,
esta excelente !,

Amazing product and received on time,
"good computer, i liek it a loot",
"The computer works great, when it works. I have had this model for eight months and had to get it replaced twice.  I wanted to upgrade or something the last time, but Microsoft and who I bought it from said, pound sand.  The last time I purchase a Microsoft product.",
When you receive your order make sure it is a surface book 2 and not a surface book 1. The only visual difference is the surface book 2 has a USB C port and no fan vent on the keyboard.,
"Not as powerful. Because it can become tablet, it does not appear to be a laptop powerhouse. Looking Dell 2 in 1 7000 - more bulky but more powerful",
"I love everything about this computer. Light weight, nice keyboard, and I love the tablet feature",
"This is a very confusing and misleading use of the images. This is using the surface book 2 as a product instead of the surface book that it is selling. The other product details mislead in saying it is a Surface Book 2 and also has that price closer to it. After my purchase, I was very upset. I hope that this is easy to return because this is not cute and i spent surface 2 money I want my surface 2",
"Good performance, vessatile and fast.",
Unit was brand new in sealed original factory packaging.  Delivery was very fast.  Well done.,
"I work in the IT industry (I have worked with Dells, HPs, and all the ohers). I have used My Surface Pro 3 since 2014 and still had no reason to upgrade it but did it anyway. I am amazed with the speed and performance. I strongly recommend the buy and you wont go back.",
"Overall laptop is good, but my adaptor stopped working recently. The laptop is not only 8 month old and charger is not working. I am not saying all adaptors are of same quality, but the adaptor i got was defective n its stopped working.",
"Just received our Surface Book 2 today and going through the set up process.  Came on time (next day with order placed on Sunday).  Satisfied with the product. as received.  Rating is on the product so far.

Have to note the delivery is a different story.  Should be 0-1 star.  The driver (in his own personal car) actually threw/dropped the package on our porch.  So much so it made a loud enough noise to us inside the house to go and check it out.  This is a computer and should be handled differently.  No damaged seen and the unit powers up to allow the set up process to run.  Will comment later if this changes.",
"Being a generous person, I let my partner try out the new Surface Book that arrived at our house. Here's his review. He's

About a year ago I decided to switch from Mac to Windows for my work computer needs. I started with a generic (but attractive) ultrabook, then acquired a Microsoft Surface Go to reduce weight. Even though it's underpowered, I found the Surface Go's hybrid (laptop/tablet) usage model really attractive. I got a Surface Pen, and experimented with using the Go as a regular tablet, replacing my Android tablet. [Note: not this device]

And then I had the opportunity to use a Surface Book 2, which I'm now reviewing. 15 inch model, Core i5 (so no discrete GPU), 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD, 3000x2000 touch screen. So what's it like?

First, it's heavy. Three and a half pounds, heavier than any laptop I've used for the last 6 years. Which means that it's not going to replace the Surface Go, it's going to spend most of its time on my desk. That's fine; I know that I'm still waiting for the perfect device.*

Second, the screen is gorgeous. Color gamut and brightness are superb, touch registration is unmatched. My previous benchmark was the Huawei MateBook X Pro, and the Surface Book 2 beats it handily (albeit subjectively).

Third, Windows Hello (face-based login) is blindingly fast. I was used to this feature from the Surface Go and my OnePlus 6T phone, but it's almost instantaneous on the Surface Book 2.

Fourth, the build quality is as good as it gets. Which means that it overshadows the latest from Apple, and it's about the same as the Huawei MateBook X Pro. (And NO MORE BUTTERFLY KEYBOARD!!!)

All of the reviews that I've seen have divided the intended audience for the Surface Book 2 into two. The professionals will pay a crazy price to get the Core i7 with the GTX 1060 and 1TB, and they'll have a portable video editing powerhouse with over 12 hours of battery life. The artists won't be able to afford all that, but they'll get the entry-level Surface Book 2 because of the ability to unplug the screen and use it as a tablet with the Surface Pen.

The configuration that I got is aimed at the second group, and I'm not really an artist. So I don't really fit the target audience, and all I can do is to review the unit as a well-built, slightly over-weight business laptop. And It fits that use case surprisingly well. The screen fits nicely just below the big curved monitor on my desk; I run all of my productivity tools on the Surface Book screen, and do my real work on the external monitor. Once or twice a week I flip the screen around into what Microsoft calls ""Studio Mode"", and use the Pen to sketch software architecture diagrams.  The lag is not perfect, but it's acceptable.

Overall, I like it. Great screen, nicely balanced keyboard, decent performance, great usability, excellent battery life.

* Speaking of perfect, if Microsoft would put a decent processor into a Surface Go, bump the RAM to 16GB, and include the LTE modem, while keeping the weight under a pound and a half, they can come and take my money right now.",

"So far, I'm very happy with this laptop. Bought the Surface Book because the detachable keyboard allows me to read magazines and graphic novels in portrait mode as a large tablet (via Kindle app), and they render in vibrant colors. The laptop mode (w/keyboard attached) works just fine. Note that it's a bit heavy for the size, but I think this is due to the 2nd/helper battery in the keyboard. The extra weight doesn't bother me at all, but might bother someone shopping for more of an ultrabook class (I got the 15"" model; maybe the 13"" is a lot lighter). All said, I'm very happy with this purchase so far.",
Muy buena,
"The first time to buy bocconi brand of computers, have not heard before, although the brand name is not high, but the quality of the product is doing really well. The price is very good, and the actual experience of the computer is very good.",

"I purchased this as a computer to do light personal work.  Yes, it is inexpensive but like they say you get what you pay for.

This computer automatically shuts down at any time.

The battery life is a joke.  It will say 100% charged yet when you unplug the adapter it will then say 0% battery and shut down.

This is a piece of junk - spend your money on a brand name",
"Was only a matter of 1 month before the keyboard stopped working, and it's honestly way too slow for its specs. I would recommend going for a bit of a higher-priced laptop, the extra $ will be worth it in the long run.",
"Bought 2 as replacements for our older Windows laptops. Love the weight, and the screen size.",
Hello; attempting to save a few bucks I decided to purchase this item. It worked fine for a few weeks I was barely using it. Now after 2 months battery is dead. Without laptop being plugged in it will not turn on. Please spend a few bucks more and buy something better.,
"So far, the wife likes it... the only complaint she has is that the keys do not light up, so she has to use an overhead light to see the white letters on the grey keys... :o/",
"Was gift for wife. She loved it.  Functional, light weight, fast",
This computer has a low resolution screen. Flagship usually the best the company has to offer. This is not a flagship. Stop misrepresenting these computers!,
"I must be one of the exceptions. This laptop, the HP 15-BS158CL series, is worth every penny. I have never had an HP before, but it seemed to me that the company was reputable. With the excellent reviews given the i5-8250U Quad-Core processor by independent testers, I gave it a try. I am not disappointed and have not had any problems at all. It is extremely fast, arrived as specified, and runs like a well made Swiss watch. I have not encountered ANY of the problems detailed by other reviewers of the same model.  I could not complain if I wanted to.",
"Bought the same model in local store this month.
The updated CPU is a quad core compared with the previous dual-core i5. The boosted frequency is 3.4 GHz which is amazing!
And the 12 GB ram is really really useful.
Love it!",
Bought one year ago..mother board went out 3 days ago. Unable to repair according to technician.,
"Computer seems cheaply made and was slow to respond to clicks and keystrokes.  Every click or stroke took a couple seconds to register, which was frustrating.  I eventually returned the product.  Not sure if the problem is the laptop or Windows 10 in general.  Very disappointed.",
"I finally updated to this new laptop, my old one was at least 10 years old. This one crashed after two months, my computer guy said the hard drive went defunct. Thankfully Amazon gave me a refund.",
"I have been using this laptop for about 6 months, and I am basically happy with it.  The one problem I have had is with the CD/DVD drive: it is extremely finicky to open.  I have to do this slightly frustrating thing where I push the drive further into the computer and then push the open/close toggle with one of my fingers; sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.  (Just pushing on the toggle button without pushing in the drive doesn't work at all.)  Fortunately, I don't have to use the CD/DVD drive very often.  I don't do gaming on this computer; just basic business application stuff. However, I do have a lot of applications open at once, and the amount of RAM seems sufficient for this: the speed/performance is fine.  I am pleased that the touchpad includes separate buttons for left and right click (a previous version of HP computer tried to combine this into the touchpad and it was extremely frustrating and difficult to use).  Overall, it seems like it was a reasonably good computer with a lot of RAM and large hard drive (1.8TB) at a reasonable price ($550).",
Works Wonderfully,
Great laptop!!!,
Great computer! HP doesn’t disappoint!,
works well with minor issues.,
Excelente,
Something happened during an automatic Windows update and laptop stopped working. Had to send it back. What a pitty.,
Goog,
Much clearer and faster then previous laptop,
I need a copy of the receipt or proof of purchase...the screen is cracked and i need to get it corrected,
Slowest Laptop ever. Battery and charging issue within a year of purchase.,
This is terrible . Ordered and was dead out of box. New replacement is also not working ! How does this happen twice ??,
"Love this computer, what a great deal",
Good product worth buying,
nothing but trouble with this computer constantly freezes up I spent 5 hours with hp tech support and still does not function properly I am very frustrated at this point.,
Value,
Extremely slow. I bought this to replace a 6 year old computer with a terrible processor and its slower than that. I installed Microsoft office on it nothing else. Huge waste of money.,
"Absolute garbage. Not durable at all. Monitor flickered intermittently, then died shortly after warranty expired. Invest in something with more durability. I’ll never buy hp again",
The hard drive failed. I purchased this in November of 2018 and as of the time of this review (Oct 2019) the 2TB HDD has already failed.,
A little slow but awesome computer for the price,
Just an OK computer. Freezes and malfunctions a lot. Start menu problem at times. Got it for a spare when my old one had problems. Back to my old one with a new fan assembly.,
"The compiter came in By color imstead of black. Came with documents indicating has call
Support with hp i called because ot wont turn on and they indicated that i have tompay for the assistance over the call",
Super slow. Glitches. Waste of money,
"Excellent laptop, easy to use, run smooth and cheap. I recommend this one.",
"EXCELENTE PRODUCTO, PERFECTO ESTADO - ECUADOR.",
great laptop for the price. its certainly not fancy but its what inside that counts,
So far it has not given me any issues and has been dependable.  I would purchase again.,
"Runs great, Very fast.  Good value. For the one star, sounds like a lemon. I did not encounter any of the issues that was reported.",
"Good laptop, best for use with business or school. Fast shipping and came brand new with no unwanted surprises.",
Going great...just needed to replace keyboard...spilled coffee.  Note to all - turn off computer immediately if you spill anything on keyboard.,
Had this machine for 24 hours and had to return it for a refund. All kinds of problems. It was extremely slow (took 30 minutes just to start). Constantly making a loud noise; couldn't install or uninstall programs (finally had to do a factory reset); files that I transferred were corrupted and couldn't be opened on the new machine; battery was halfway drained an hour after unplugging (are they using old batteries?). Very disappointed.,
it's a good deal but if you plan to play PC video Game don't buy it. The Video Card is too poor only 1 GB. Try to find at least a 2GB one.,
"Flagship? Really? Edited: DO NOT BUY!!! TOTAL GARBAGE!! I don't really use it too much so it shouldn't be lagging due to hardware wear and tear. Takes forever to boot, even after logging in it takes at least 10 minutes before you can use. I will never buy another hp product again! Windows is garbage but this takes it to a whole new level. If you want to pay over $500 dollars for pure disappointment and frustration buy one of these.",
Hi. Was impressesed at first. now the screen aint coming on. Help. Cyralene,
"Maybe it's because I made the mistake of buying it used, maybe this laptop isn't efficient but 12 GB of Ram and a Quad Core i-5 processor do not seem to mean anything. Slow, lagging, terrible laptop. I do not recommend.",
"I am very disappointed that the AC adapter is ONLY for the US 120V.  One of the questions has asked about the input voltage and the answer is obviously wrong.  Being a laptop, I needed to bring it around my international travel, but it is useless in this regard.  I have to buy an expensive universal laptop charger, hoping one of the outlet fits this computer (HP Flagship is not listed anywhere).",
Its a bit flatter than the usual but not as fast as I would expected. HD quality is not what I expected and the mouse keeps flickering.,
The best laptop I ever found. This laptop is powerful enough to do anything I put it. I can play games at high settings with no problem on some. For example I am able to play black ops 2 at ultra settings.,
"Every time Windows 10 automatically upgrades, this notebook crashes and I have to reinstall Windows 10. But with the most recent Windows upgrade crash, I can't even sign in to the Welcome Screen so I can't do a recovery. This computer is 4 months old and still under warranty, but HP support it horrible. They keep promising to send me a link for a Recovery Kit I can download onto a flash drive, but the link never gets sent. I now have SEVEN case numbers in two days and still no link.. This is the worst computer purchase we have ever made and a complete waste of money.",
I forgot to check for the ethernet port.  it's so important to have one as wifi is not great all the time everywhere.  nice laptop though.  was able to purchase an adapter usb to ethernet.  cool,
"Not really what I was hoping for. Laptop is pretty slow for supposedly being the flagship model of HP, should have just spent the additional money for a gaming laptop simply for the speed.",
"As a preface, sometimes the 'N' and 'B' keys do't work, so I'm leaving I every mistake while I type just to show you how much of a icoveience this has ee. I absolutely hate this laptop.

This laptop functions well but the plastic that covers the working unit feels cheap and has started separating. Definitely will get metal next time or at least from another seller that might have better material,
I am no expert but I am very happy with this computer. The only complaint I have is that the sound is inadequate. It is very difficult to hear unless I use Bluetooth or headphones.,
"My old computer finally failed and I did a lot of research on new ones. I finally settled on this one and it, so far, was a great choice.",
"purchased as a gift. Seemingly good hardware for the $ spent, but out of the box it runs at 100% disk usage. Had to disable various windows features just to get back down to 0-3% on idle. Usage of any basic program will bring it back up 25%+. May benefit by downgrading to win7",
"Who looks for where the speakers on a laptop are located? Next time, I sure will. This laptop has a lot of power and storage space, it's light-weight, but if you enjoy decent sound out of your laptop speakers, don't buy this. Unknown to me when I was researching buying a new machine, some laptops now come with speakers located on the BOTTOM of the device. My old one had speakers on top near the lid and produced good sound. The sound on this machine is horrible, especially if you have it in your LAP, as in laptop, where they can be muffled.",
"It is so light weight and fast. It is amazing; I enjoy HP products, the printer 8720 as well. It is so easy to fax, scan and print with it.",
"1. It arrived in a timely fashion.
2. No issues with condition.
3. Performance with Windows 10 and the standard 2TB HDD is poor.  Extremely slow.  Truly hard to live with!
  I immediately replaced that drive with a Crucial SSD and it's a different animal.  Fast and, thus far, running very well.
4. During disassembly to replace the drive it became apparent how cheap the plastic case is, but I suppose that's to be
  expected considering the price of the machine.",
"When I first got this laptop, it was everything that I had asked and hoped for. It ran quickly, booted fast, ran the games that I needed it to, took the notes that I needed, the whole nine. It was perfect for what I was doing as a college student. I had it for eight total months before it started to get louder. Then nine before I started receiving messages that the fan was malfunctioning. I took it to my school's IT place and they said it looked like a screw was missing that was holding the fan in place. I don't know anything about it or if the screw was even there since I'm too scared to open up my own laptop. I don't know how to do this stuff and I wasn't going to mess it up more. They cleaned the fan, but they couldn't fix the loud clicking and whirring noise coming from the fan. Now a little further down the line almost 1 year and it's shutting down randomly, taking forever to start up, freezing, won't stay on if it's not connected to a power source, and the clicking is constant and makes it difficult to use the laptop. I can't even take it with me to class anymore to take notes because of it. I won't say not to buy it, because I loved my laptop in the beginning, but be warned that, even brand new, you're probably going to have to replace it within a year or two. However, if you don't just have 600 dollars to burn on a laptop, then pick something else or invest in the warranty. You're going to need it.",
"This is by far the worst computer I have used in the past 20 years. It doesn't come with Microsoft office, this is why this laptop is cheaper. The product spec claims up to 3.4 Ghz, when you open the task manage it states it's a 1.6 Ghz, far cry from 3.4 Ghz. I bought this laptop to do word, excel, surf the Internet and read e-mails. This morning, it took about 5 minutes to open an excel doc. The fan always runs like crazy and the fan is loud, I can't figure out what is going on in the background. I buy a lot of items from Amazon and I have never written a review, basically because I've always been satisfied, but not this time. I will never buy a PC/Laptop from Amazon again after this experience. I will buy it from somewhere I know exactly what I am getting, I can try it out and have it supported.",
"It is extremely lightweight and the 2 TB hard drive is excellent for storage. I did add a 128 GB M.2 SSD to help with start up/shut down speed and overall performance. Even so, this is a great laptop!",
"It works. Haven’t done too much with it yet but, it works pretty well for the adobe products.",
"Excellent computer for the price. Consider this recommended specs for a successful windows 10 experience in my opinion. The hardware inside hits all the requirements for a good windows laptop without overkill parts. Since buying this similar spec laptop with an SSD costs hundreds $$$ more (Something is wrong with our laptop market), I did a $60 dollar separate SSD upgrade and this machine is more than twice as fast as the original.  Highly recommended for those that are capable.",
"The fan runs a lot, to make the laptop fast. Just play some music to cover it up. This is a PC you can take to your friends house, but don't forget the cord. This laptop will last a couple hours on battery with light use. The bloatware affects performance slightly, I will likely do a clean install at some point, but its not a major issue.  Now, I don't know why hyper threading is disabled in BIOS OOTB but it is, and I noticed right away when MEmu would not load a single instance, yet once hyper threading was enabled, started right up. Maybe hyper threading is disabled for the same reason the go carts at the theme park are throttled: so nobody gets hurt. Maybe enabling hyper threading will make your laptop melt or light on fire (doubtful). Either way, mine has hyper threading enabled (in BIOS) and it is a fairly ambitious multitask er for any average user. In the 450-550 price range, this feels looks a good deal, on paper.  remember, only 3 USB ports 1 reg 2 SS, no USB C no touchscreen, it comes with a disc drive that MAY come in handy. The laptop does not open fully flat, so be careful. SO, enable hyper threading in BIOS (at your own risk) as in my case I would have been 100% a dissatisfied customer if this laptop couldn't run multiple instances of MEmu to a greater degree than the aging i3  I still use everyday. So don't complain it is slow until you try a clean install with hyper threading enabled. Oh, and the screen is, a laptop screen, i guess. (I assume HDMI out works fine)  its all white washed out compared to my PC monitor. I guess that's how laptop screens all are. I assume. Don't forget to disable all the ""occasionally show tips""  settings in Windows 10 to bring the process usage below 100% when doing nothing (long unfixed Windows 10 bug). When properly configured, this is a fast laptop in the i5 8th Gen arena. So Far So Good",
"I got this back in may. Brand new from Auth dealer. It actually was drop shipped from their distributor. It died in a week. Screen started to blink and freeze and would not boot. I did a full wipe of ssd and reinstalled windows (afrer 2 tries) and it died again  during initial boot. Not even sure what the issue is.

While it worked. it wasn't bad, Very bright display. Good speakers, Keyboard a bit different (arrows) but otherwise ok.

But, it died in a week. Seriously? I did post a msg on their youtube channel when they unveiled it, and it's been month+ and no one cared to reach out.",
"Purchased this product because of its high specs combine with what something really important to me, the 810g rating. At a nearly 4k price point with an insurance plan I expected it to be better. It constantly runs at high temps when utilizing the gpu but still functions. The high temps have caused an aesthetic hinge cover to come loose, but still functional, the 4k screen seems to be slowly warping upwards on that side because of it. The battery life with the 4k screen is longer than normal but that still isn't a lot of time away from a charger. The main concern is the lower casing, its too flexible and when showing work to others the touchpad isn't consistently useable due to physical  issues with the bottom housing flexing from its own weight. The whole housing should have been metal and even with the 810g rating, a dent in that bottom case could keep the touchpad from working forever. Repairing the hinge when contacting msi is understandably an out of warranty repair. At its price point  and considering you are paying the 1200$ premium over a gaming laptop with similar hardware specs, the build quality should have been higher.",
"I got this light weight windows 11 laptop and so far its very good. I'm currently using it to type this review actually. It runs very smooth and it's very fast. The screen is very clear with vibrant colors. This laptop is perfect for school, gaming, or work. Overall, I'm really pleased with this laptop and highly recommend.",
"A powerful and efficient device. The 12GB RAM ensures smooth multitasking, and the 256GB storage provides ample space for files and applications. The 14-inch display offers a clear and vibrant viewing experience.",
I use it for work as a GM technician and it’s super fast and has no issues downloading software. The high speed ram/rom on it makes it nice! and for the price it’s hard to ignore you can buy this same computer from a big name company and spend an extra 500-700 dollars and all your buying is the name the more you study computers the more you understand this is exactly the same but at a very great price,
Es muy rapida y Calidad increible.. recomendado,
"Bought the Lenovo IP31 1135G7in July 2021
The charging port became a little loose and I could no longer charge the lap top.
The total cost with upgrades was approximately $700.00 when bought new.
The repair cost quoted to me was over $800.00 for the fix. This is because the port is connected to the mother board so I had to pay the price for that as well.
Needless to say I trashed this lap top.",
"Received refurbished product. Turned it on and used for a couple hours.  Stopped charging within 24 hours. I don’t know why but I do know that any product ought to work for more than a day.

Returned. Awaiting my refund.",
Laptop is great! But when ordered through the amazon vendor the refurbished laptop came with glitches in the screen. Was told to go through Microsoft for a warranty exchange. Took some time but all good now. But feel it should have been checked out before sending to me.,
The Laptop keeps saying boot error tried multiple things still not fixed,
Laptop was delivered within 36 hours of order. It's in Excellent MINT condition. Brand New.,
Huge step up from the Chromebook we used for school last year.,
"I’ve been super pleased with this machine. I ordered for my wife for Zoom meetings, online work, and word processing. Great machine! I would order again no questions asked.",
I have this laptop for work and I loved it so much I wanted to buy one for personal use. My referb was in near perfect condition with only the TINIEST bit of wear on the mouse pad. For the price I definitely can't complain. Runs perfectly and looks great.,
"I received this PC and already returned it. Very disappointed . Everything in this PC is bottom of the barrel. It has no name brand PSU, Single stick of 16gb RAM not dual, multiple cables unplugged inside PC. Then the green screen of death after days of trying to fix it. Bad Graphics card. This PC is absolute junk and they should be ashamed for the outrageous prices they are asking . You should be getting top end stuff. Do not buy.",
Several functions are erratic. Will not consistently connect to USB display. Is erratic when using Microsoft apps. Never had these issues with Dell. I will have to write this one off and go back to Dell.,
"This item works, but it is underwhelming. USB C does not support HDMI display, so you're stuck with the large ""HD+"" display and the additional HDMI port. I tried several different HDMI dongles and get ""display connection might be limited."" Resolution on the screen is low 1600x900. Makes small font hard to read. The keyboard is not backlit. The keys are hard to readin the glare of my desk light. They also charge a $100+ restocking fee to return. The seller offers support through Asus, but the website doesn't recognize this model. I am stuck with an upgraded old laptop. Not worth the $800, especially when it is available for under $400 at retail stores. I am so dumb for buying this product.",
Junk! After only two months it required HP help to get it to turn on. Now it needs a code of buttons and power on and offs to start up. Don’t buy this piece of junk.  And it is slow as a snail with no memory after all the factory programs are installed. It actually only comes with a few GBs of free space.  Total scam.,
"I happened upon GoGetComputers several years ago.  I have bought all my computers
from them ever sense.  Friends and family buy from them also.
They are always prompt, and suggest something perfect for my needs.
Most of all, they always seem to find a way to delight me, usually by exceeding my requirements.
I trust them.",
But internal speakers stopped working after 3 days of poor usage. Battery isn't as full as described. Device gets more overheated after simple usage,
Very happy with this product..the laptop is in very good condition..I wasn't spectin to be that good..thank you so much..people with lower income.. we need this tipe of deals..now I can finish producing my songs without any interruption ..???? thank you ????,
all looks good,
"Was learning to like it like it. Then just past the 90 day warranty time the chromebook turned itself off and will not
come back to life. Fully charged and with power plugged in or out it will not respond to the power button.
At this time ( APRIL 8, 2020 )  HP WILL NOT ALLOW  ANY SUPPORT OF ANY KIND FOR THIS PROBLEM. There is
NO phone or chat help available. The HP Chromebook X360-14 is too big for a paper weight and too light for an
anchor.  A lot of money for a useless product. My last ever HP product.",
"5 star laptop. Better speed and touchscreen quality than any of my Microsoft laptops and the best Chromebook that I've seen.  The screen is ridiculous big and bright when you flip it over to Tablet mode and it's thin and portable to take anywhere.

Best Chromebook on the market",
"We'll first and foremost, I did not purchase the laptop through Amazon. I purchased it to a second hand seller in brand new condition, for the fraction of the price of what they asking for here on Amazon. Also just because you don't see the app on the Play store or that favorite Android game doesn't mean this device can't play it. Actually on the contrary it depends on the developer of the app / game and how long will the developer take to release a version for the Chromebook please keep in mind people this Chromebook device is not a Android smartphone, which been out for 20+ years now. And Chromebooks been out for 10+ years. Stay calm and be patient in a few more years Chromebooks devices would have 100% of Android app and game support.",
Woke up this morning and my laptop was in a puddle of some liquid coming from within. GARBAGE>,
"Very good. The only problem is the screen , because is very dark!",
"It's a very nice laptop, but some game apps don't work at this time.",
I returned this item because it cannot deliver 4k 60 hz over usb-c .,
"I can watch something on You Tube at the same time on my phone.. my phone speakers are better! :(
Just tried to watch the Irishman on Netflix.. FORGET it.. at Full volume.. I can't hear what they are saying
(I am NOT hard of hearing) LOL
I went to return it tonight.. and I waited to long. I will have to buy additional speakers. what a shame
The keyboard is not like a laptop.. I'm still adjusting.
When you think you are hitting shift for a capital.. it goes into Search mode...",
"Happy with the laptop overall. It works great and is amazing quality! The top of my laptop came with a small scratch on it. The add says 2020 HP but it is the same as the 2019 model. Do your research, there is no 2020 model, yet. Shipping was fast and came a day early. Yay amazon!",
Looks sleek. Works well. Kids love it.,
I bought this to replace my old HP laptop after 6 years. This is wonderful!  Love the 360 design. It’s super fast!  I use it for work and personal!,
My wife purchased this a few weeks ago and loves it! She is able to do anything she needs to online and only has minor issues with using the touchscreen in the web browser so far.  A restart has fixed the issue.  turns into a tablet very nicely and it feels very well-built.  Looks very good too!,
"When used as a laptop on a desk, it works flawlessly.  In tablet mode the same can't be said. For some reason it locks up often in tablet mode.  In tablet mode it just stops responding to touch screen motions, especially on busy web sites like Amazon. Very frustrating.  Battery life is good.  Keyboard backlite is ok. Rubber strips on base don't stick case well and came off after a year.  Can't really recommend because of aforementioned issues.",
this chromebook replaced my 6 year old one with flying colors. the transition  was seamless and added great features.  the touchscreen works great. yes it's metallic and has a lit keyboard. the top of the outside is white and the bottom is silver in and out.  it would be hard to find a better one at this price at this time. that's why it would be a logical choice.,
"I work at a public middle school, I am also a Linux enthusiast. After playing around with the Chromebooks the school district bought for the students to use during  class, I became really interested in this platform. When I read that the Chrome OS now supports not only Android apps, but Linux apps I decided that I was going to buy a Chromebook.

Overall, this Chromebook works well and I am very pleased. Granted, I did use some Amazon points and a gift card I had received for Christmas so the out of pocket price was significantly lower than the $500+ HP was selling the machine for. In other words, I may not have been so happy had I paid list price.

The Good:
1. The machine looks cool and feels very sturdy.

2. The 64 gigs of hard drive space (not counting the 20 or so gigs taken up by the OS) are aqueduct - most mobile apps are fairly small. Some Linux apps can be a bit large, but provided one does not go wild installing apps the provided hard drive space should suffice.

3. On a related note, Google does give you 100 gigs of storage free for one year. Additionally, I was able to mount my NAS in less time than it took me to write this sentence. So, at least at home, I have more space than I will need to store files.

4. The Chrome OS found my networked HP printer and setting the printer up on the Chromebook was very easy.

5. I don't use Gmail, but Chrome allowed me to ""install"" a web app to my email provider's web interface which works pretty well. Personally, I would rather use a stand alone email app. Using flatpak I was able to set up Evolution. Unfortunately,  I was not able to get Evolution to save my password - retyping the password each and every time I wanted to check mail may be a good security measure, but it gets on my nerves at home so I attempted to install Thunderbird. I received an error that I need a newer version of flatpak to run Thunderbird. The command line option to update flatpak returns the notice that no update is available. I settled on Claws mail which works well. I should make clear that these limitations have nothing to do with this particular machine, but seem to represent the state of the OS and Linux integration at the moment.

The Not So Good:
1. While back-lit, the silver color of the letters on the keyboard make viewing the letters extremely difficult. This would not be a problem were the keyboard to mirror most other laptop keyboards I have used. Something is different and I can't quite put my finger on the problem. What I do notice is that on my desktop PC and my Linux laptop I can type without looking at the keyboard. I consistently hit the wrong keys on the Chromebook.

2. The screen has a lot of glare.

3. The speakers work fairly well when the Chromebook is in the position of a traditional laptop. When you fold the screen over to make a tent for viewing a video, the speaker sound becomes muffled due to the speakers being blocked by the screen. Ear buds solve the problem.

Still, overall, the Chromebook works very well and feels solid. The more I use Google's OS the more convinced I am that this is the future for non-gamers.",
"I was hesitant to try out a Chromebook, but I have to say I have fallen in love with it! It's fast, sleek, and does everything I need it to. Very user friendly!",
"Its hard to find as good as value as the HP X360 with 8GB Ram. This Chromebook got an ""Honorable Mention"" on a recent Chrome Unboxed 2019 review on YouTube. At just over $400 its tough to beat. The Asus C434 Flip is arguably a better Chromebook but costs $100 more for the same specs. The X360 is really great value.

Either of these two Chromebooks will meet most peoples needs with a solid aluminium build quality, convertible into a tablet. This X360 Chromebook runs the Android Play Store apps well which is what I got it for to be able to run Skype, which it does flawlessly.

The Chromebook does support the new Google Assistant, not that I use it much. I'll talk to a dedicated device, not so much to my laptop/tablet. I'm using Amazon Echo throughout the home so I suppose that's why I don't use the Google Assistant very much.

So glad HP went with a USB-C charging cable. HP sensibly put regular USB ports on the device as well. As with most laptops now, no HDMI port, so to connect to an external device you'll need a dongle. The charging cable is a standard laptop brick, shame they didn't go with a travel charger.

The lettering on the keys is fairly light with low contrast which at certain angles can make it difficult to see which key is which. The back-lighting works well.",
"On line information said this model came air cooled. Mine came with OEM liquid cooling and a 1000 watt power supply. YMMV.

The B550 motherboard for the AMD cpu supports two NVMe drives. Since this model came with only one drive, I decided to add a 1 Tb NVMe drive on a card that fits the x4 slot. Games and other data can be stored on one of the fastest storage devices available. There is room for several additional storage devices beyond the two that I now have.

The 32 Gb of ram runs at its stated rate in two 16 Gb sticks to better utilize the dual channel capability of the CPU.

This was an OEM machine with no after market parts until the NVMe drive was added. Hence warranty issues should be clearer.",
"It’s been almost a year since I bought this bad boy. I got the 3070 and r7 5800x, 32gb DIMM. Pretty affordable price when I bought it. I only give it a 4 star cause this is one of the worst cases I’ve seen in my life. Zero air flow, PSU is straight chillin in the middle of the whole case, This things on a swivel system, like, what?. Motherboard is GLUED on to the case so don’t even bother getting that off without some sort of saw device. Im planning on gutting the entire thing and putting it into a new case with a new PSU. Overall pretty happy it works great, I keep my room cool so it’s not truly a problem, it plays every game I throw at it to cyberpunk 2077. I use a 1080p monitor, but I’m confident it could support 1440p just as smooth. 4K would be a stretch, but I’m sure it could run",
"I am pleased with the laptop.  It helps a lot with some of my homework at school. It runs very smoothly, I especially like to connect it to my Xbox controller to play PC games!and it's portable and beautiful to look at.  I also plan to recommend it to my roommates!",
This laptop looks pretty fake it’s not even worth hundred dollar not cool,
"Unfortunately I'm not sure what's wrong with this laptop but it's not working properly. I let it fully charge for hours and for some reason it still won't turn on I don't really know why. It's a shame because the look of it is super cool.

The pros about this is it has a very decent specs inside, the metal is super high end looking. Just opening the lid up is just it's a really nice experience. The keyboard is not bad I personally prefer the number pads on the side but this is a smaller laptop and there's really no room for it. I feel like they put a lot of effort to make the entire experience nice but for some reason it won't turn on and I don't know why. I'm hoping that it's only me that has this issue because it looks so cool.

I personally am a big fan of name brand laptops so I honestly was trying to give this a try hopefully I can figure out what's wrong and get it working but for now it doesn't turn on at all. I charged it overnight same issue it just won't turn on.",
I didn't have high expectations for this laptop but the expectations I did have were not met. The touchpad is very sluggish and often non-responsive. I found it very aggravating trying to navigate around the computer. It does come with a mouse but usually when I'm using a laptop it's because I don't have a desk area so  a mouse is not an option. Sometimes I have to click a dozen times before it acknowledges the command and opens what I need it to. This negates the value of any of the other features for me...,
First one we got the screen was cracked so we sent it back. Company sent us another one.  It worked for awhile and then the power cord broke off inside won't buy another one and I was kinda thinking about it.  Not now.,
I ordered the laptop and it was not connecting to the internet so I ordered a replacement from Amazon and this one is not connecting to the internet either. It’s not worth the headache and I can’t get any work done with the internet.,
It doesn’t hold enough space but what I wanted it for. Dissatisfied with this product.,
"I ordered the Acer Swift 3 SF313-52-526M on Sept. 28, 2021; so I have had it for a couple of months.  No problems so far.  Everything as expected.  Upgraded to Windows 11 with no problem.  However, there are a few things to note:  1) the price has gone up about $100 in two months, 2) you cannot upgrade the RAM, 3) there is no hdmi port, 4) there is no SD card reader, and 5) there is no ethernet port.  I have not actually taken the back panel off and looked, but it is my understanding that the RAM is not upgradable on Acer Swift 3's.  I am using a USB-C hub for an hdmi port, SD card reader, and ethernet port.  With the Thunderbolt 3 port, the right USB-C hub works great.  My hub has hdmi 2.0, so I can run my monitor at 4k @ 60hz.",
Decent product for the price you pay.,
tablet look s good preforms well,
This is exact what I need for. Great product & price.,
Recommended! Excellent laptop with lots of features!,
One of the better computers I have bought over the years,
"Clerity & nice size screen, very good price for i7 HP product. very satisfied",
Easy to use.,
"It is nice but the hard drive failed one day after warranty expired, HP could care less, had to buy a new drive and install it.",
"Large screen, good touch screen, keyboard is easy.
Don't know about tech support.
Drawback:  sometimes the mouse/ touch pad get confused and mix things up on the screen.  I use word and excel.  It's still new to me, so hopefully I'll learn how to not have that happen.
Came well packaged and quickly. Thank you",
I don't even need reading glasses for this screen. Lightning quick boot and auto upgrades to Windows 11. Only thing I don't like is the glare off the silver surface. ( I use it in a van). Makes it hard to see the keys. Great deal though. Highly recommend.,
Really nice,
I absolutely love my laptop. I knew it wasn’t touch screen when I purchased it. I use it for streaming movies and writing. I did not get it wanting it to be exceptional but it exceeded my expectations and I couldn’t be happier. I don’t expect it to be the fastest for things like gaming but I did my research and it fits my needs perfectly for what I want to use it for.,
Laptop is very slow and not good at all. It's written touch screen but it is not so. And while I'm downloading software the laptop frezees for few minutes so don't buy this laptop it's very bad one. I i haven't got this laptop as I thought.,
Cannot get out of S mode without a Microsoft account so cannot be purchased as a gift. Cannot install software outside of Microsoft store.,
Computer is not touch screen! One of the reasons we purchased this was for touch screen. According to the seller this is auto-generated by Amazon but not in seller details.,
"This computer works fine, but the hinges broke in less than a year. Now, it won’t close or open all of the way.",
Screen quality very good will help with business,
The touch screen isn’t working so far,
Using this laptop to access my online accounts.,
"Do NOT get this computer! I got 4 of them for my kids' homeschool. We use the headsets with the male/female plug and not USB...HUGE hardware issues. Have had to replace 1 of the computers FOUR TIMES and another I am just having Acer fix instead of replacing since EVERY replacement (save the last one) had the SAME hardware issue (all within 8 weeks, mind you). The Mic won't work when a headset is plugged into the male/female plug. If you press on the computer casing near the plugin..all of a sudden it will work..but as soon as you release the pressure the mic stops working again. I believe it is an issue created when the company upgrades the memory (as I had them all upgraded). I wouldn't buy from this company either: Oydisen Electronics. Couldn't speak to a live person and even after emailing several times and explaining the issue they just sent me a canned response that addressed none of my concerns.",
I'm not a big computer guy but I do like Acer generally . I have the Chromebook 15 also. It's ok but small memory. This Acer though thin and supposedly average specs is super slow. Transition between programs and clicking and opening is what bothers me the most. I end up clicking and typing multiple times before anything appears on the screen. Annoying. I should have returned this laptop.,
It fell apart in less than 8 months.,
"The computer I received is not touchscreen; but this is listed under touchscreen, because the details say Not a Touchscreen. So, in searching for a touchscreen, this came up. The first day I used this computer, letters started coming off the keyboard. It is pretty lightweight with decent screen quality, but obviously it is annoying to have keys popping off continuously.",
Personally I don't think this laptop is very user friendly but my main complaint is that after only having it for like 6 months the hinges broke. Was able to rig up to work but now stuck with an ugly laptop cuz I surely don't have the money to buy a new one.,
"This computer literally fell apart. The screen lid came apart and disconnected while sitting on my desk. This is after just 9 months of occasional use. Annoying setup.

I’ll never buy Acer again.",
"These is a good computer for basic use such as email, videos, and gaming.  The price was very good and I am happy with my purchase.",
Study,
"Works well for my needs! Not too sure about ""S mode"", thinking about getting rid of that.",
"Reporting this seller to Amazon in the hopes that this gets fixed. I bought this laptop for a friend to study in college with, SPECIFICALLY because of the balanced specs and Windows 11 Home as listed, then waited a week for it to arrive at his house in a different time zone. The dang machine shows up with Windows 10 S installed. That's a solid hundred bucks I'm being ripped off for, I really could've just bought a laptop at Walmart and had a better experience than waiting a week to get an effectively defective machine. This laptop is for a really good friend of mine, my personal machines are all custom builds of some kind or another because i work in tech and music, and i wish I'd just rebuilt a pawn shop computer instead of losing money on this.

Really, just list the right version of windows in your product description, it's hardly 3 letters of effort but the user experience is dramatically different, please get this right",
Has the features I was looking for at a price that was on target,
It's a basic computer and serves its purpose. It's not for gaming and is not touch screen but I knew this upon purchase,
Es buena marca y tiene lo necesario para estudiar o trabajo de oficina con los programas de office. El color es super llamativo y todo funciona muy bien.,
"The machine is nice and sleek very light weight, crisp screen quality and boots up quickly. The hinges between the monitor and CPU were a bit stiff, not sure if it's a general situation, but mine snapped and I am now forced to get it repaired a little over a month after purchace. Not happy about that.",
I bought one about six months ago -in blue- and now a gold one for my husband. Nice machine!,
"this thing looks and runs great, had a full charge also.it came with windows ten but i can change it back to seven.i definitely am happy with this laptop",
Great machine,
"Just what I needed, for an Amazing deal.",
Makes other contractors jealous!,
The toughbook was in great condition and works extremely well,
quick deliver and in great condition!  Works great running linux as well.,
Great product! Need something rugged for the harsh environment I work in. Definitely would this product and ABCD Computers have excellent customer service!!!  Shipping was so fast USPS couldn't track the item!,
"can not love an inanimate object, so it gets a 4.  Very satisfied. It is tough, dropped it already, no problems.  Work in industrial construction.",
"Excellent notebook, very well-made. My friends want to try tossing it down the stairs to see how tough it is, but I'm somewhat hesitant. It came refurbished, so there are two long scratches on the screen. Otherwise, it is a solid computer that I'm not afraid to go mobile. I dropped the Microsoft operating system quicksmart, installed Ubuntu, and am happy to report all of the ports, WiFi, etc work like a charm.",
"Disappointed...it has not worked well. Froze up up. Upstart and does not hold a charge for very long. Trying to work with it ,but it should not be this much work.",
I like my chrome book. It is nice and handy for my school and college. I will recommend this product to others.,
wORKING FINE.,
One thing I like about this chromebook is that it is very durable and the battery life lasts long enough. The product itself is great and it is in perfect conditions.,
Really makes a difference for me to get my homework done and also watch movies. Only one dislike - Can’t put apps in the desktop,
Plays well its purpose: do homeschooling and simple work-from-home stuff. Love the white color and that converts to tablet!,
"Purchased in may of 2019. Five months later the chromebook doesnt power up anymore. Contacted hp and  found out there was only two weeks left on the one year warranty.  The warranty was activated six months before I purchased the chromebook from the seller on Amazon. If the chromebook didnt stop working ,I would of never found out about this warrany scam. Beware. Amazon should be held accountable for their sellers.",
"This computer is definitely ""no frills"". But it does all the basics, (email and internet connection), and it does them well. I heartily recommend this.",
not bd,
"I am very pleased with the chrome book.
I use it for email, reading, and word processing.
It looks great in white.",
Don't have many hours on it yet. So far it is just what I need for document making and web surfing.,
"When it worked, it was perfect. I loved the touchscreen. I loved the design. Unfortunately it kept shutting down at random during use. I tried doing a factory reset (“powerwash”) and then it never came back on again. Wish it wouldn’t have had the powering off issue. It would have been the perfect laptop for school. Disappointed :(",
"Excellent computer! I already live in the Google Apps (gmail, google calendar, google drive, documents and sheets) so it was a natural change over to a Chromebook. Perfect for my business and personal use!",
Worked great while we had it. My son had it stolen from him in Milan aboard the Night Train.,
Great body; Horrible Screen resolution: pass on this product.,
Great product at a decent prize.,
I have only had this for a few weeks but love it.  It works great for what I was looking for.  I can used easily anywhere.,
Its more like a tablet,
"I purchased this computer and after a 5 months the screen quit working. When I open it up it is blank and my home page flickers on and off. I have not been able to use it in almost a year. I though maybe it wasn't working because it was not on a flat surface, but that does not help either. If for some reason the screen does work it will flicker off after a second or two. Not worth the money.",
"I loved everything about this computer until the keys on the keyboard started to come off. One by one I tried to have it fixed but the damage was too great. Damage? I used it for school and work,  very lite work out and still the keys which were badly glued on popped off. I ordered another cb  the lenovo  for only a few dollars more for more storage.  will stay clear of HP products from now on. Not like they used to be.",
"I have had the laptop for a year and it just died on me. It will not charge, it will not hard reset and no electronics store will help me fix the problem. I am very frustrated that I have had it for such a short period of time and now I have to drop another $300 on a new laptop.",
I bought this used (not renewed) & Im happy to say its in pretty pristine condition! Definitely recommend for students on a budget :) (sticker is my addition),
"Ordered and received in August,  first week of Sept. all of a sudden the screen goes black and then a battery pic comes on that shows 1%..  I did everything the HP website said to do to fix it except take the  battery out and put it back in which I had no tools to do and didn't feel like I should have to anyway.  My previous HP lasted 3 years and I gave it to my grandson because it was still operating...but this HP Chromebook has been packed up and shipped back.  I'll not get another one.",
Functions great for our family of four!,
I just wished I knew what the screen look like. It's a little matte for my linking but it does its job.,
Only lasted a year and a half before it broke.,
"Way to many pop ups and redirecting when online. I would not purchase this item again and would return this one if I could. It goes off when I try to use some of the apps I put on it. I have had IPads, Kindle Fires and All In One computers and I have never had a device that is as much trouble to use as this HP Chromebook.",
"The wireless mouse that came with the laptop doesn't work with for the laptop.  I try to connect using bluetooth but the bluetooth couldn't find the wireless mouse.

Plus, I ordered this product the second time for my mom, because it had touch screen, and it didn't even come with touch screen. I'm very disappointed.",
I just got mines today and I’m in love! The laptop has a nice lightweight yet sturdy feel to it . Also the overall look is nice. It was easy to set up and get started!,
It seems to crash quite a bit. The cursor seems to jump around when your typing an e-mail. Sometimes it just gets wiped out.,
Bought this for my daughter for school. Was a breeze to set up (took less than five minutes)!,
"Received the new product and it displayed ‘an unexpected error has occurred’.  I looked up all the information to reinstall Chrome OS due to the “Chrome OS is missing or damaged” message on the screen, to try force the Chromebook to boot into recovery mode. Long story short, all our efforts failed and I shipped it back. I bought a new product as a gift and the recipient let me know of the issue. I tried to rectify the problem without optimal results. I feenlike I shouldn’t have to struggle with a new product and this time was unwilling to pursue correction further and returned.",
"I have used the Chrome book since February, 2018. It runs kind of warm, and now some of the keys don't work at all. I am not able to log in because one of the keys is in my log-in address. Pretty mad!

Now it is September 21 and the replacement that I received on August 20 has quit working. There is power but the screen stays black. Pleae help me.",
"I paid $299.99 for this Chromebook in May 2020. It lasted 6 months until November 2020. I looked up the warranty and it expired June 2019-Expired a year before I even purchased it. SO the Warranty is no good, I am out all that money, I used this for school and now have nothing. The seller would not answer back when I tried to contact and Amazon said it doesn n ot qualify for refund or replacement. VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!!",
After 3-6 months key after key stopped working to where you can’t use the delete key and several others.  I have been trying to get in contact with this company directly and through amazon and no luck.  Now we are in real need for this laptop to use for homeschooling and can’t get anywhere.  We bought a chrome book because kids already know how to use them because they’ve used at school.  Very frustrating when I can’t get a response for an exchange or return!,
"Bought for my granddaughter for her birthday, she loves it",
"I ordered this laptop for my daughter for Christmas and barley two days later she came to me saying the sound wasn’t working. After doing some troubleshooting, I just restarted it and the problem fixed. I thought it was a fluke. Eventually she was coming to me constantly about the same problem. Not even a week later it stopped working entirely and was making this really creepy mechanical sound continuously (even off...its been two days and it’s still going. I put a few pillows on top of it to muffle the sound until I can get it all packed up to send back). We’re pretty disappointed.",
Good little laptop. Bought for a 10 year old. It seems very durable the battery life is really great and it charges really fast if turned off. Less then an hour to full charge.,
This chrome book shuts down too often. I really do not like it although the battery life is good. I have had better chrome books!,
Love this.  Perfect.  Plug and play.  Worth every penny.  Bought a second for my son one day after plugging mine in. Simple and effective.  Great sound and resolution. Light weight.  Can't go wrong.,
"Having lost my touch with an android electronic, there was a little bit of a learning curve. I love the touch screen, it makes scrolling super easy, works just like a phone or tablet",
"I don’t usually write reviews, but I felt it was needed for this product. Bought for my daughter to use for school, she also used it for other non-school uses as well, like watching Netflix. Worked great, for 2 weeks. The keyboard and mouse suddenly stopped working, as well as the power button. We tried all the tricks to get it to work, including the only suggestion HP’s tech support could offer of “power washing” which is their version of a reset, still didn’t work. It was basically now a big touchscreen tablet with a non-functioning keyboard attached to it.
Only good thing was Amazon refunded me in full without any hassle because it was in the 30 day window for returns.",
They Chromebook is light and very useful for what I need to do for work and play.  They screen quality is good and great price.,
"Great lap top, was expecting touch screen after reading the questions and reviews.",
"I love it, my job uses this laptop and it’s so easy to use!! Battery life is amazing",
The reason I'm giving this 4 star is because the screen glitches but everything it works fine,
I'm not a big Chromebook guy - gave it to my granddaughter and she is happy with it.,
"I dislike the fact that it doesn’t have a caps lock button very disappointing, overall great product",
It came early which was a plus and it’s amazing. This laptop is easy to carry around while doing my school work. The battery lasts all day. It makes it easier for me to download my pictures.,
"I loved it!!  I was afraid at first to switch from a regular laptop to a chrome book. I was very pleasantly and gratefully surprised. It’s so perfect. Everything I can do in a computer, I can do on the chrome book.",
"I bought this for using the Linux terminal. It works pretty well, I could run Docker and VSCode with no problems. Will slow down a bit when running HD videos and browsing at same time, but no big deal.",
"I was hesitant to purchase my first chromebook, but glad I did. Since most of my time is spent on Chrome with little need for traditional pc based programs, the chromebook is perfect.
Pleased with the speed and convenient, seemless use of Google applications throughout the chromebook.",
So far just now using it. No issues. Light weight and just what we were looking for. Great for the price also,
"I use this laptop for everything involving school and I love it so much! The battery literally lasts forever, and there is so much space. Now I can use my desktop for strictly major projects, TV, and such which I use my laptop at the comfort of my bed and work on my notes.",
"This will only allow Google account and information. It sends other info to the trash so you can't add/ transfer windows accounts.  I called Google and spoke to Sonia from Pakistan. If you want to get to another account you log into Google  then try to access a different account which is my default account. It throws it to trash or u can't use it as before. She said it would be easy just one step more to do ,,NOT. Don't even think about transferring data etc. I'm sending this back to Amazon. If u are a first time only Google person perhaps great. I've had a computer always a Windows type since 1998! I've Seagate to hold data. I've had many this was a big mistake. The info isn't accurate. Google traps you... DON'T BUY THIS.",
Wife is in a nursing program which requires her to access powerpoints and google docs. Does everything she needs it and light weight,
"Got this laptop for my grandson.  He loves to play video games and always wants to use my desk top computer when he comes over.  So, I bought this laptop for him and he loves it.  This is how to keep an 11 year old quiet and engaged.",
I absolutely love my hp Chromebook. Just made th switch from a full laptop. Was a little nervous but the lightweight design plus super quick speeds and fast startup left me wondering why I didn’t make the switch a long time ago. Love being able to convert to different configurations.,
This chrome book is perfect for a teenager the only downside is it’s memory capacity but for a young teenager it’s great,
"cute laptop , battery lasts a long time .. great for watching movies/tv shows !",
"This HP Chromebook is EXTREMELY great. I was more than happy with it the moment I started using it. The screen size is huge, HD quality, great speaker sound, and I love how mostly all the apps you use on your mobile are easily accessible for the laptop. I highly recommend. Only thing I would have wanted was backlit keyboard.",
"I bought this as a stop-gap chromebook--until the new chromebooks all come out and I can get something better.

Pros: Price, size, decent screen.

Cons: Takes longer to start than any chromebook I've ever used. Muddy blacks on screen. Gets pretty warm (no fans, so I'm a bit concerned).

I would not buy this again.",
Still getting used to the key board but so far so good ...I do miss 10 key on the right side but I love how compact it is and user friendly.,
"L button was detached when I opened it, didn't return it being that my other laptop crashed mid semester and my classes were online. Otherwise good computer, stays charged for long periods of time.",
"Having used numerous laptops and several Chromebooks I know what works and this one is not on the good list.  The first one had to be replaced because it was DOA, the 2nd has been running reasonably well until 2 months ago then started getting random horizontal lines and flashes on the screen.  And now in just the last few days, the wifi will drop repeatedly, the internal radio is failing.  I've had to powerwash a couple of times to address performance issues.  The screen is not very good but workable.  On the positive, it is light, great size, love the keyboard, and B&O speakers are good for this design.",
"I had a regular desk top and my son talked me into this kind of computer. I am so happy with it. I have left if plugged in so I can not comment on battery life. I do love the ease of the chrome system and this light weight, streamline computer is the nicest I have owned. I like the key board, the keys seem tight and pop, if you will.Just very happy over all.",
I was very excited to get this chrome books for my twin girls now homeschooling but one is working fine since I got it 3 days ago but the second one only turns on once and I barely was setting it up and died forever.. desapointed but I will order again and hope they will send me one that works,
"Great battery life, does everything I need when recently traveling.  I kept an eye on my online retail, mapped destinations I sent to my phone, kept contacts updated.  Very seamless and intuitive interface.  We played podcasts through the car stereo on the long road trip.  Truly a great buy for my needs.  Used it for under a month so far.  At home I throw YouTube onto my Chromecast on my TV.  Works great.",
"It was good enough for surfing the web while it lasted.  You shouldn't expect much more than streaming and surfing on this device. It only lasted 3 months of light use before dying on us.  Screen went dark and won't come to life even when charged.

Edit:
It came back to life about a week after writing this review and is working fine now.  Not sure what is up with the thing.",
"So far I love it, is only giving it 4 stars right now because ice only had it 1 day. I will follow up in a few weeks if anything changes but for the price I paid it is a really decent lap top.",
"I havent even had this notebook for 2 years and I think it might be done/dead already. For occasional use, it works perfectly fine but you must keep it on the charger otherwise. I have run into the issue of having to recharge it for days and simultaneously turn it on while plugging it in hoping to get any power back! A known issue for these. Now, I got the notebook slightly wet (not enough that I would think would do any damage) and it has done it again. It's been much longer than last time and I still can't get any power going. I'm not sure if the money to pay to have it fixed would even be worth what I paid for this, I will probably be buying a new laptop soon.",
"Being new to the Chromebook I would have appreciated some type of instructions being included.  I don't even know how to turn it off!.  However, price was great and it shipped faster than promised.
Still learning!!",
"Great running computer just doesn't run applications I needed for school such as the adobe cc programs and illustrator

No HDMI port either

Other then that it runs beautifully and the Wi-Fi connects better then any comp in the house  fantastic high def picture as well",
My old HP Chromebook finally died (after years) so I was very happy to find this one as a replacement. Although I liked the outer casing on my old HP better - simply for aesthetics - this Chromebook is much nicer overall. The fact that it converts to a tablet is a huge bonus. The keyboard has a nice feel and both the touch pad and touchscreen have the perfect amount of sensitivity; they respond well to the touch without responding to every accidental brush across them.,
"I really like the look and feel of this product,I can only give 3 stars because I cannot even get beyond the wifi sign up page.I cannot get it to sign into my wifi it either says wifi to far away or password incorrect.other devices sign in with no problem so I know its not that.If anyone can help me I would appreciate.If not I will have to ship back ,I really don't want to do that so if anyone has any ideas thank you ahead of time",
"I bought this laptop for the sole purpose of social media and watching hulu/netflix and twitch. It is amazing. The battery is awesome.
ONLY COMPLAINT IS
no fan???? be careful about how hot it can get because it has NO cooling fan! But i wouldnt tell you not to buy. DEFINITELY buy!!!",
"This is our second HP Chromebook.  The first one required 2 different repairs (purchased SquareTrade insurance for 3 years).  Yes, it was repaired but went without the computer each time for over 7 days.  The first HP is still working at 2.25 years old.
Second purchased 1 year ago.  Several keys and trackpad stopped working.  Fortunately, I purchased the SquareTrade insurance for this one as well.  Just found out that the computer cannot be repaired and SquareTrade will send me a check for the purchase price.  WooHoo.  I am done with HP.  All of the issues with both Chromebooks were related to regular wear and tear, not accidents.  If you purchase this or another ChromeBook, invest in the insurance for $30 for 3 years -- the insurance is worth it!",
An excellent value for the price. My only complaint is that it occasionally has unresolved sound driver issues that force a reboot to fix it. The sound system occasionally turns into an unintelligible screeching that can be fixed with a reboot. Overall a great value though in an inexpensive and fun laptop for my grad school.,
"I am a broke college student. When my macbook broke down this year I need a fast and easy alternative. I bought this chromebook for $250 not expecting much, and my expectations were definitely met. I was honestly surprised at how fast, easy to use, and sleek this computer is for only $250. Sure there are some minor downfalls here and there, but I can't imagine getting a better computer for $250. I would have paid $400 for this, especially since I already had the means to increase storage which is a huge plus.",
"Got the chromebook a few days ago, set up was easy, its running fine, like the screen and the speakers.
Not to heavy, quality looks ok.

Problem is I cannot connect it to an EPSON L 380 printer, using a USB cable. The Epson L 380 does not support wifi.
Any idea how to connect to the printer? Thanks for any help !!",
The Chromebook works great. The only issue I have is that after 2 years the power cord develops a short in it. its easily fixed by ordering a new cord however if im paying almost 500 for an item i expect all parts to last at least 3 years with no issues.,
"It was lighter than expected, due to it being made from a lighter plastic-like material. Still sturdy, just not as much as I thought it’d be. The 14” is not a touch screen, which was a big selling point to me but it’s still easy to use. I already use google everything so this was nice to have. Little bit of a learning curve but a good laptop for students like me.",
"What I like most about this Chromebook is that it uses a USB-C charger. It was one of the big reasons I bought this one. I can use my MacBook charger and don't bother taking the Chromebook's charger out much. One standard charging system is so nice. I've also used charge and video over USB-C to my LG monitor with no trouble.

The higher resolution screen is nice. This model has run Linux apps in containers using Crostini since before I purchased it. You don't have to root it to use Linux apps. It's nice to have Atom, SSH, etc.

Otherwise, it's a Chromebook. They're all the same.",
"I use this for work, mostly the Zoho Web App Suite and Google Docs, and an SSH client.

The best part is the battery life.  This thing lasts 1-2 days with moderate use, and fully charges in under an hour.  It also will install apps from the Play Store is a plus.

Know what you are getting with ChromeOS before you buy.

Cons:  It’s not my favorite keyboard but I’m getting used to it.",
"I really like the fact that 4Gb came with a laptop of this caliber. Although it does not have a usb port for removable disk, it is still worth the $200 I paid. I am happy with the speed and memory this laptop has. I have purchased an adapter to use a removable disk with the laptop and now it is complete. I am able to use for my job and I cant forget how nice and sleek it looks. White is a nice color for this laptop. So, I would recommend and urge others to purchase if they are looking for an affordable option to fully functioning laptop.",
"My laptop was received without an operating system installed.  I needed to go on line with another computer and an 8 GB flash drive; so that I could download and install the new operating system.  I was able to follow the instructions and install the OS successfully.  This had been a somewhat frustrating and unexpected experience for a brand new computer.  However, now that it is done this laptop works very well.",
"bought this as a birthday gift and while my wife doesn't like to use her old laptop due to size, this was gets way more usage than the old one ever did. It boots up super fast, weighs very little, small enough for her to travel around with, good screen resolution and brightness, decent sound, and the battery life is great. Obviously she isn't gaming or rendering videos on this thing, but if you're just trying to get online, do some research, watch some netflix and chill, then this a good laptop (Chromebook) for you. Also, don't forget that the storage Drives on these things are tiny which is fine for her since we use Google Drive and photos for storage.",
"First one failed about 40 days after receiving it. Amazon replaced that (even past the 30 day period) with a new one that has been so far working as it should. These are very nice and battery life is excellent. A student could carry one of these to class, use it all day without recharging most likely. Note that these use a micro-sd card for data storage (you can also use the Google Cloud). You can store pictures on the card (a 32 gig card is the size used) so there is actually a lot more capacity than what might be believed. Note that a Windows computer can ""read"" these cards so you could save the contents to the Windows computer if so wished.",
"I bought this with the idea that it would be good for travel.  If someone stole it, I wouldn't care and that it would have a long battery life.  On those grounds, it worked beautifully!  I also use it when I go to meetups and need to have slides running on a continuous loop and don't want to worry about a device that I use regularly (for security).  I haven't experimented much with Linux on it (though it seemed to install cleanly).  Android apps have worked fine on it.  I'm definitely satisfied with this purchase!",
"After going through two Acer products and returning them for various problems this HP smoked them. The screen is nice, keyboard solid, and memory card addition works (yes, use a small band-aid to ensure to keep it in place). My first Chromebook was an HP and nice to see the advancements made with keeping the price point in the right spot. I was thinking 13.3 was the way to go, but compared to my prior 13.2 screen maybe a quarter of an inch larger in width. Glad I went this route and back on 14 inch but with a small format. Okay, HDMI is MIA but can buy a USB-C to HDMI for 10 bucks so if I need will purchase but not be a whiner as not on this laptop. Good Job HP you ripped this one!",
"This was for my 71 year old dad with 1 bad eye. In chrome OS you can't put icons on the actual desktop. You must slide the taskbar up, or tap a button. You can't put links to websites like I did for him on windows with a good description of each. You can't set it to log on without prompting for a password, which for him is almost a deal breaker. I had to guide him to type his password in if websites forgot it. To do it every time would be murder for him.

Those things I could talk him through, if he never got used to the convenience of windows. But here's what happened the first hour of use to me setting it up for him, checking all things out. In YouTube a video was playing, I was trying to delete some old bookmarks. The whole thing froze, no response, sound of the video was like a broken record. Then after 100 presses of power it did shut off. When back on, no sound. Had to reboot it to get the sound back. This is the first hour, of the first day. Be sure you all know what these are. Limited, clearly less stable than windows. Android, but not Android. I got a launcher, but couldn't link sites to it, or make it my main desktop. Facebook Android app wouldn't load, though in chrome it works fine. Just know this everyone, it's not as good as Windows, I don't care what anyone says.",
"This review is for HP Chromebook 14""  14-ca040nr.  The display resolution is really awesome. I like that the USB-C power/data ports  are  located on both the left and right hand side of the unit! So you can plug it in from ether side.
 This unit does have  left and right stereo speakers  mounted directly below the screen. The B&O sound system is nice I guess, hope your are not buying any Chromebook anticipating awesome sound quality.
This was purchased to replace an Acer model 720 which I have used for 5 years.  The user interface is nearly identical. My Acer suffered from battery bulging as I left it plugged in all the time. No laptop especially ones with non-replaceable batteries should be left continuously plugged  in to an AC outlet.
I really like to have a Chromebook around usually use by bedside, also when my Windows desktop is under going a 3 hour update right when I really need to get something done.
The  price on this model changes daily I paid  $299 the next day it was selling for 259. Rats... oh well it's nice and I was scared to recharge my old Acer with the battery issue.",
"I can't stand Windows OS anymore. To damn controlling and the forced updates that mess things up and always when i start it up because i don't use it much anymore so i might as well pour a cup of coffee and sit down for a while. Google is questionable as to how android is going, so i figured it would try a cheap chromebook. I do not care for the operating system at all. So stripped down, and everything software side sucks. have to get root access to be able to have reasonable access to file system, mouse support is crappy, and i will stop cause i could go on for awhile. Guess it is good if you only want mail and internet access. Have to hope you can  find an extension or app on the chrome store.
update 12/7/18: i really really don't like Chrome OS. Access to the app drawer is a move your mouse around to get to the drawer with two clicks instead of opening by clicking on the drawer button.  Finding files is a hit and miss deal. I installed a video downloader and only the app finds the files. Does not show in the Chrome file app, nor in the ONLY app for this in the chrome app store. Shouldn't have to go to Play store to find such a common app. Need to root to get access to files and that erases all your data on the chromebook. Updated this morning, and it took about 15 minutes before it would restart. I was freaking out that my new laptop was dead. Some warning upfront that it would take that long would be nice. That is one of the reasons I wanted to get away from Windows, and now it is starting to be the same with Chrome. So unhappy with Alphabet/Google. Maybe i need to start considering Apple.....",
"We've had three different ""budget"" Chromebooks, the Acer C720, Acer Chromebook 14 and this HP Chromebook 14 G5.  Of the three, the C720 has lasted the longest. We have young kids who are hard on the machines and only the C720 lasted.

This one only lasted one year. The trackpad is caput. It felt sturdy and of similar build quality to the C720 but ultimately it couldn't stand the test of time. Even the Acer 14 seemed to be more fragile despite it's aluminum body but that one we got two solid years of use out of.

I have to say we're disappointed with the longevity of the HP 14 G5. I was hoping it could permanently replace the C720 but it didn't.

If you don't have young kids who abuse your electronics then this is probably a fine option. It had the juice to run Android apps and we never felt it was underpowered for general web surfing, Google Docs or remoting into a work desktop with Google's remote access tool. I'm sure if it were better cared for it would have lasted much longer.",
"Let me start with saying, the chromebook is really nicely designed. Very lightweight. Love that it can go from computer to tablet..... BUT I feel that since this is my second purchase of the computer, I can leave an honest review. The first purchase we made, the computer kept restarting. We could not do anything. We returned it (to the store) and we purchased the same one online because we figured the other one was defective. No.. It does not restart constantly but it still restarts making the computer untrustworthy.  I wanted to use it for my son and also my nursing classes but unfortunately I am forced to purchase another one (DIFFERENT brand).",
"This Chromebook is a powerful thing. I can see things way better on a 14” Screen rather than a 11” Screen. The Color on the display is true-to-life and very vibrant. The color of the laptop exterior is my favorite part. HP Laptops have always been reliable, even more so with chrome inside. The laptop is super fast and very lightweight. I am definitely glad this thing comes with a warranty as well, seeing accidents happen at home or school. I intend to use this for the incoming school year and hope it meets my expectations.... so far so good. The price was very good for such a great laptop and definitely recommend.",
"When we bought this the first time, it worked great. One afternoon, I was minding my own business, using the computer when suddenly the screen turned grey, and then shut off. We were then unable to restart it. We then purchased the same computer again, and the same thing happened to me just today. We only got about two to three weeks use out of both of them. Therfore, it's probably not a good idea to buy these computers.",
"I love my new HP ""14 Chromebook (14-ca040nr).  I basically use this Chromebook like a tablet.  Put another way I don't use it for work, nor for heavy duty computing.  I use it to stream videos, check email, shop on line and visit websites, to gather information.  For these type of activities, this product works fabulously well.  It is very small and light.  So far, it seems very durable and well built.  I am extremely pleased with the battery life.  10 hours is not an exaggeration.  The screen quality is also very high and video detail is excellent.  I'm very pleased with my HP Chromebook, and have no complaints thus far.",
"I bought this laptop to type my notes while i'm at work and at home for watching online dramas. This Chromebook  is fast and lightweight. Defiantly worth every penny I spent on it, and since Chromebooks are cheap. That's saying something. Great investment. I should of bought one sooner.",
"Loveee this laptop! The pure white color looks so pretty! I think it is so cool that it is touch screen and a can convert into a tablet. I teach students online and this has been a life changer. My previous laptop is bigger in size and slower since it is a few years old. This one connects well to my wifi and the video connections does not lag. I also like that I can carry it anywhere since it is small and lightweight. I have been using it for about 3 months now. To have the features of this laptop for such a cheap price is a dream come true.

*Update: Feb 6, 2020
Used this almost everyday since I have purchased it and it is still running strong! I am still in love with it!

**Update: Dec 2, 2022
I no longer have to use this laptop as my occupation everyday, but I do use this for my own leisure and it's still going strong!",
"This review is for the NON-touch screen 14-ca040nr.  Reviews get lumped together, so it's good to know which product you're reading about.

I'm a semi-retired IT technician, so this review comes from that standpoint.

If you're not familiar with the Chrome operating system you may want to do some independent research before purchasing a Chromebook.  While they are designed around Cloud computing (with most data being saved in Google Docs rather than locally), it's quite possible to work with the machine offline.  You can specify in Google Docs that files should be available ""offline""; a copy of the file is kept locally and syncs back to the Cloud when WiFi becomes available.

Google Docs (word processor, spreadsheet, presentation software) all come with your Gmail account and is the ""base"" set of applications used by most folks on a Chromebook.

I've enabled Linux on the HP, and installed LibreOffice - primarily because there's no database application in Google Docs and I do a bit of work in databases.  Linux works very well on the HP for that purpose.

Linux also allows the installation of GIMP, which is a PhotoShop type image editor.

[EDIT 9/30/18 - I should note that Linux documents (such as you may create in LibreOffice) should be kept within the Linux folder structure.  Keeping such files on an SD drive doesn't work - Linux can't ""see"" that drive.  There may be a method to guide Linux to the proper folder.  If I take time to figure that out I'll update the review.  In the interim, plan on using a bit of the 32gb of internal space for LibreOffice docs.  The upside is that, of course, such documents are totally independent of the Cloud, just like they would be on a Windows machine).

I've enabled File System For Windows (another app) which allows me to contact to my Windows 10 Pro machine and transfer files to and from while on the same network.  Chrome RDP allows me to take control of the Windows machine while on the same network and Chrome Remote Desktop allows access to the Windows machine from wherever there is an Internet connection (without direct file transfer - if you need to swap a file, just drop it into Google Drive).

If you're a DropBox user, you can install File System for DropBox on the Chromebook.

Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, OneDrive, Outlook, etc. are all available from the Microsoft web applications.  Microsoft Access is not available on the web apps.  There are also Android apps for Microsoft (which I don't use, I use the web apps).  If you have encrypted Word or Excel files the M/S web apps can't open them.  You can install the (free) WPS office suite and it can open password locked Microsoft documents just fine.  If you enable Linux, LibreOffice can also open encrypted Microsoft documents.

Splashtop for Business works using their web app, and from that I can log into remote Windows machines (including  Windows Server 12r2).

As you can see, quite a bit of work can be done using a Chromebook - it all depends upon your needs and the setup.

The HP has a decent, but not great, keyboard.  Battery life is excellent.  Be advised - there's no dedicated ""delete"" key or ""caps lock"" key.  You can remap the ""search"" key to emulate a ""caps lock"" key but that affects cursor movement if you're working in Google Docs.  If you haven't used a Chromebook before, Google for how the keyboard works.  Takes a little getting used to, but it's doable.

There's a micro-SD card slot (I'm using a 32gb card, but it will accept larger cards if need be).  Remember that, while Chromebooks are fairly secure, the card is not encrypted by default.  There are encryption apps available for locking down the SD card.

The screen (the non-touch version) is O.K.; it doesn't come close to the Pixel screen but it costs only 1/4 as much as a Pixel.

The charger (included) plugs into either of two USB C ports - one on each side of the machine.  The machine also offers two USB A ports.

The touch-pad is good - it doesn't get in the way when typing.  However the ""mouse clicks"" on the pad are 'way too hard and loud.  In a library setting it would become annoying very quickly.  Better to use the 'double tap' on the touch-pad rather than click the corners.

The speakers, for this size of machine in this price range, are excellent.  (I'm not an audiophile, but they sound pretty good to me).  Unlike many lower priced units the speakers are on the Chromebook surface, not underneath or to the sides.  [EDIT 9/30/18 - Using the on board Bluetooth I was able to successfully ""pair"" the HP with an Amazon Echo.  Playing .MP3 files from the SD card using the on board Audio app works fine.]

Printing is still a bit of an issue with Chromebooks - if you've not used Chromebooks before, do some research on printing lest you be surprised.  Remember that Chromebooks don't accept "".exe"" programs (so you can't load M/S Office from a DVD) and you can't load printer drivers (there are work-arounds but you'll have to look 'em up on your own).  Google Cloud Print is supported.  Still, most printers aren't 'plug 'n play' by simply plugging in a USB cable.  I'm printing to a Samsung, a Kodak 7.1, and an old HP4050n which is hooked up to a Windows 10 machine via Ethernet.  It may take a little more effort than you're used to with ""plug 'n play"" Windows.

There's no Ethernet port on the machine, but you can get adapters that use the USB C ports and have Ethernet connections.  Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are, of course, supported by default.

The power switch is above the ""backspace"" key and not likely to be hit accidentally - an improvement over my last Chromebook.

One note on Cloud storage - Google offers a 100gb ""free"" upgrade for two years (after that if you use more than the 15gb that comes with a Gmail account you have to start paying).  You can Google that - but be aware that if you have multiple Chromebooks (as I do) assigned to one Gmail account, you can't ""stack"" or extend the 100gb offer.  It's 100gb total for each account.  IMHO Google should change their policy on this and, if a new device is purchased for the existing account, the 100gb offer should be extended from the new date of purchase.  YMMV.

YouTube videos seem to play well - I don't play games or watch Netflix on the machine, it's more of a workhorse for me.

Out of the 32gb total internal storage, after Linux and all other apps that I use are installed, I have 18gb free space (not including the SD card).

Fit and finish is good (although the machine is basically plastic) and it weighs about 3 pounds (again, the non-touch screen version).  It is, for me, a true ""laptop"" machine in that the bottom doesn't get too hot to hold when it's in my lap.

Overall I'm really pleased with the HP 14-ca040nr.  I've read reviews that say that Chromebooks don't work offline, or don't offer software - and those reviews are wrong.  You just have to set the machine up properly.

HTH

Jim",
Good,
size,
"I chose this to replace an older Chromebook that is no longer supported.  These are quick and easy workhorses.  The setup rebuilt all my files and apps, login's and passwords for me. Too easy.  I use it for Gmail, Facebook, maps and news feeds.  Seems to last as long as I need it to daily. I also enjoy reading books on it.  Turned to portrait position, It's just about the size of a book page.  Yu can enlarge the type and it keeps up with where you are.  Nice tool. I split time in tablet mode and keyboard mode.  Touchscreen and mouse pad are fine.",
"This is a no nonsense workstation for whatever workloads you can throw at. Graphics is crisp with the RTX 3080, and the memory as is sufficient (and you can max out to 128GB if needed).

For the uninitiated, this laptop and any ThinkPad for that matter, is not known for its looks, but more than makes up in performance and ease of use.

This is a heavyduty - both in name and performance - workstation. The charger (230W brick) is heavy in itself, so you'd better get a padded backpack to carry this if you would be lugging this along.",
"A gift for my son,  he loves it. Uses it a lot.",
"I am very happy with my purchases. Also I got the items very quickly, which was great!",
Fantastic tablet. Powerful processor runs apps super fast. Beautiful screen for reading or watching movies. Would definitely buy again.,
"This is a great tablet. It's fast, works well, has good battery life, etc.",
"Great Samsung tablet, colors and graphics are phenomenal and the screen sensitivity is excellent",
Love and live on this thing and with kodi now ive seen every movie there is out there.,
Best gift I ever bought my wife (other than her Anniversary bands)  :-),
"My wife loves it and if she's happy, I'm happy.",
"I love it... have it for a year now... still works wonderful plus, great pictures quality... very fast",
"I have owned kindle, Kindle hdx, Samsung Galaxy tab 4 10 1"", now the S2 9.7. This one is perfect.",
It is all that it says it is!  I enjoyed the fact that I could download the Hunger Games trilogy for free!,
"Ive had this tablet for 4 days and have done pretty mich nothing with, once i did decide to use it It out of the blue gets stuck on the logo screen and wont turn off.",
Better than expected ordered a WiFi tap s2 9.7 got a new cellular cdma WiFi s2 9.7 bonus works great,
Speedy tablet but the battery life is sub-par,
"Love this Tab, so much cheaper then the air and the screen and speed is so posed to be better.",
It is great.  Was nice to get it at a discounted price.  It was my daughter's Christmas resent.  She uses it everyday.,
"Got this as a gift for my wife and she loves it, makes me wish I had one.",
"Great product, but it made my eyes hurt. I adjusted the settings yet my eyes was still uncomfortable. I bought the Samsung 10.1 tablet and no issue with my eyes. The only drawback... no finger print scanner on the Samsung 10.1.",
"I use this constantly. Looked at countless reviews and opinions...  This is the best one I could find , and very happy with it!!!",
"Nothing to say except LOVE IT!  Quality, ease-of-use...everything. Easy to set up as well.  Blows all my other tabs that I've had out of the water.",
"We ordered this product for use at work, got it started and set up, then within 2 days the tablet stopped taking a charge. Attempted to call customer service from Samsung who stated it would be WEEKS before we would get it back. Our house is run by Samsung and we have two phones that need to be upgraded, but after this poor service we are very hesitant to remain brand loyal.",
"The picture is INCREDIBLE. I love this tablet in so many ways. Since I also have a Galaxy phone,there was no learning curve to using the tablet for me.",
Perfect,
I ended  buying  this after going through  three  of the Samsung  10.1 580 tablet in two weeks this one has far  seceded my hopes,
Got this for my MiL for my FIL to give to her for Xmas. She loves it! I got a similar  erosion for V-DAY from my husband and REALLY love it!,
"Be aware it doesn't support partition larger than 2TB via OTG drive, and it doesn't support Unicode filename completely - file gets lost with Unicode characters.",
"My most favorite tablet I have ever bought! It's fast, HD, and lightweight! Use it to play games, watch movies, browse the internet, and much more! Great work, Samsung!",
Nice feel.,
"Ordered this brand new and it came in already opened with some scratches on the side of the metal, hair all over the rim of the reapplied plastic film on the back, and the micro sd tool came in a plastic lunch bag. I know this is a decent product but I did pay for brand new not used.",
Got this for my fiance as a Christmas present and he absolutely loves it. He likes his Samsung smartphones so that is why i decided to go with the Samsung tablet. Glad I made this purchase.,
"Love my new tablet. I have been using Samsung for about a decade now. I had been using the 7 inch note before this. The jump to 3G  of ram was noticable, the screen looks amazing.",
i love the way it runs but volume button damage on it. not sure it was brand new. still works great but i paid for new. so 3 stars.,
"Very happy I purchased this tablet.  When I ordered  the Galaxy,it was a toss up between this and a kindle fire.  Both are good products but for me the Galaxy is better for my needs.",
Best Android tablet I have ever encountered.,
Perfect size and weight for ou use.,
"Half of the apps don't work.
Good battery life.
Good camera.
After a while stopped recognizing the external SD card (Samsung EVO) and destroyed all the photos it contained",
"i really like this tablet. the screen is very clear. it is very fast and i like  that it charges through micro-usb and not a special plug like the other galaxy tablet that i bought 3 yrs ago,",
I love it. Great tablet it really surpassed my expectations for it. I used to think a tablet was just an oversized phone but now I think tablets  have established themselves as a standalone product.,
"Works like a boss with my phantom 4. Leaves my ipad air 2 in the dust. Games are faster, video is better, and price is waaaay better. Not sure why I was an apple fanboi before.",
"This is so much lighter,thinner than my older Galaxy tab. I love it. It doesn't have a stylus pen, but then, I rarely use the pen on my older tab.  Very easy to use and so convenient. Love it.",
"Like it overall, except fingerprint feature that doesn't work well",
"Fits perfectly, with almost no margin for error. Surprisingly easy to install given how exactly it must be placed. I had to pull it off twice to adjust its placement but I ended up getting it on perfectly.",
Work good hard to start sometimes and deleted email mails,
"This is just the best.  Easy to use, easy to see and comes with all the bells and whistles you could ask for in a tablet.  I haven't used my laptop since I got this great tablet.",
Works great but it has the worst battery life,
Wow! I absolutely LOCE this tablet originally purchased the 8.0 screen but returned it for the 9.7 and I am so happy I did. Tablet is ultra fast..it displays such beautiful vivid colors. I am so pleased with this Samsung product. Buy it! Seeing is believing!,
This is my 5th Samsung for my own use and this certainly seems to be the best.The screen has great clarity and processor is fast. Like it a lot. I do like the larger screen size on my other tabs but the picture on this is superior.,
My wife loves this tablet. It has a great screen and is light yet solid.,
Easy install but one corner seems to have a rough edge and no matter what I do it won't lay down.,
Works great.  Likexpect it better than my ipad.  Only downside is battery charge doesn't last quite as long.,
I was very sceptical to order a refurbished product after reading few reviews where they reported scratches or tablet not turning on etc..However the one what I received looks like new and it works perfect. Am happy for the purchase.,
"I love this tablet. No complains so far. Beautiful line and design, good sound and resolution. The battery life is ok. I have to recharge everyday for at least 30 min, but that is to be expected. I wish it came with a better file manager but I guess there are apps for that.",
"I love the tablet when it works. It arrived as what I am assuming, a brand new item. This is my first tablet I have ever purchased/owned so wasn't sure what to expect. This tablet is constantly shutting off on me and wont respond/turn back on for about 30 seconds each time. Super annoying when I'm in the middle of something like trying to read an article, watch a video, or play a game. Not sure if other people were or are having this issue or if it's something I'm doing to cause it? Even when I don't touch anything, it does it.",
The tablet is good but it's highest sound is low. Even if noise in room increases little bit the sound from this tablet is not audible enough at full volume also.,
"Great product so far! Just received this today. It is the first tablet I now own, so I am no techy, but I am impressed with the fluidity of the screen and I am getting used to the tablet format of things. This is gonna be my on-the-go buddy from now on, especially with the Microsoft Office apps.",
"I ordered the tab s2 9.7 inch 32GB. I took a risk in ordering a product that had minor cosmetic damage. Well knowing that it might just be the box That's damaged. I received my tab s2 today excellent condition no scratches brand n
new just the Box had the plastic seals ripped but it's nothing noticeable. 100% Satisfied",
"I like the tablet mostly, except that support is so limited.  I have spent hours trying to get my Samsung or Google calendars to sync between my Samsung phone and the tablet.",
"This is a great Tablet.  My only complaint would be run time/charge time which is just a little on the light side.  Operationally, it does everything else well.  I would recommend it.",
"Wife loves it. She'd complain about her iPad all the time, slow, lockups, etc. The tab runs fast and with no problems. Only problem is when she has to recharge is, she hates having to use her notebook. Might cost more than the cheaper noname brands, but well worth it in the long run. Invest in this, you will not be sorry.",
Great job Samsung ! This pad is fast and smooth. I would guess that the screen on this is about as good as you make it for the human eye. Pretty much every just pops when you request it to load. Very happy with it. I  have had four other tablets and I didn't think I would very see one this smooth.,
I have purchased 4 Samsung tablets of varying qualities from Amazon.  This was just out when I purchased it.  It has seen daily use.  And I took excellent care of it.  It stopped taking a charge recently and will not turn on.  Every Samsung tablet I have purchased to date has had this problem. It just stops taking a charge after around 1.5 to  2 years of use.  I will not be purchasing another tablet from Amazon.  The protection policy I bought was no good either.  Amazon did me a disservice.,
"With all this scary stuff going on with the Note 7 don't let that prevent you from getting this tablet. It is amazingly light, lighter than my iPhone 6S Plus and feels great in the hand. The device is fast, can run custom roms and be rooted. The screen is beautiful as well. Just buy it.",
"My IPad needs repair and I thought this might be a good alternative.  It works just fine though I miss the feel of my Ipad.  The Tab S2 is amazingly  thin and light weight and, for the money, a very good value.  I haven't bought a screen protector or case yet, but I have dropped this twice and there is no visible damage",
"I love my tablet it's everything and more then expected, this was a hot item and you guys had it...awesome product I will buy again from you...",
"So glad I got this instead of another iPad to replace my old iPad!  It took a long time, but after first starting it up and signing in, it downloaded all my apps from my Samsung Note 4 phone, so it was super easy to set up!  Fast, powerful, great picture, takes a 128 gp micro sd card, thin, and light.  Definitely recommend over the iPad!!",
"I like it a lot, only complaint so far is that when deleting emails you can only delete one at a time, unlike gmail where you can check the mails that you want to delete and then delete them all at one time.",
"A little marvel. The tablet is exceptionally light and well made. I haven't found anything yet to slow it down: everything works really fast. The much praised OLED screen is a missed blessing though: you do get perfect black with it, but the green tint really shows itself when view angle is not strictly perpendicular.
But hey, you want good colours, you buy a PC monitor that costs two times more than this tablet.",
"The product came as advertised. New packaging and obviously a new tablet. So much faster than my four year old 10.1 Galaxy tab. Soooo much faster. Absolutely love it! Samsung makes upgrading so easy to with smart switch. Copied everything, including apps, from my old tab to the new in under an hour. The display just blows away the newest Ipad side by side. Got a great price from the seller and love my new tablet.",
"What's not to love about this SG Tab S2!  I chose the 9.7"" size which is just right...can still slip in most of my handbags.  Amoled screen is beautiful. It is very fast.  I added a 64 GB micro SD card for any apps that can be moved there to free up device storage.  Also use to store music, etc. Tab use is easy and intuitive.  I highly recommend this Tablet...thin, lightweight, easy to use.",
"My wife had an iPad prior to this tablet, one day all of a sudden, the screen went black.  We took it to the Apple store and they could not repair it. Normally I am not an Apple guy the only reason we purchased it was because there was an application that I could not get on android. So we purchase this tablet and it has been awesome my wife loves it",
"Amazing tablet - especially after having the original iPad one!  Display is gorgeous, easy to use - especially correcting text and has a delete key, which is something the iPad didn't.  Sound quality just w/ the tablet is amazing when using Spotify. I vetted this between the new iPad and reviews said the iPad had a higher quality than the ""plastic"" Samsung and wondered about that, but it is extremely high quality and I couldn't be happier w/ my choice.",
"I used this for 3 years now and it realy is a great tablet. It gets everything working. The battery is a little short living after 3 years of heavy usage, although it still lasts one day wihtout problems. Now you probably have better options. But this is a great one if you are on budget.",
"This is a great tablet I like how smooth it runs.no lag issues alot of the apps I use run so smooth on this beautiful tablet. It is great for game play or any other purpose. The screen is bright and vibrant. The octa core is very handy in keeping this device running smoothly, I am happy you can expand your memory with an SD card. I use this daily. Ice used many samsung tablets in the past this is definitely a huge step up.",
"Too expensive. Great tablet, but still second best behind Air 2 (I know the spec is bettter in some area, but Air 2 still better device when actual hand on. Just like I had a low end digital camera that took much better pictures than expensive high-end pixels canon). Tab S2 will not win over Air 2. I bought this tablet because I want android tablet. If I don't mind IOS and itune. Air 2 is a better tablet even for same price. A copy cat and 10% more expensive is just a bad way to do bussiness in general.",
Quality midrange priced tablet that is as good or better than jpad. Google play app store is great and so much better than amazon Kindle app store. Tablet is fast and easy to use. Onscreen keyboard is better than ipad (has alphabet and numerical on same keyboard). Tablet also has built in back button on tablet as well as home and multi window button. Battery is decent - watching movie on 3 hr flight only took battery from 100 to 85%. Only downfall would be the android OS which can be buggy.,
"Awesome screen. Super light. Wicked speed.
My first one arrived with a weird defect on the back cover that I thought was only cosmetic. Within two days though the letter M in Samsung came partially detached and gave me a paper cut (its made of some thick foil). I decided that for $400 I deserve one that isn't going to pick my finger and exchanged it through Amazon. Great customer service with Amazon, too.",
"Beautiful, thin, fast, and easy to use tablet. It is shockingly thin, though as you'll see in any reviews you read, this does have a negative impact on battery life. Still, the tablet is fast, comes with all the benefits of Android, has a nifty fingerprint scanner that works just like the TouchID on Apple products, and has a gorgeous screen. Strongly recommended for anyone looking for a top of the line Android tablet!",
Really well made tablet. I purchased a 64Gb card to add to this and it has everything we need for a mobile device like this. We use it for our travel and for around the house when using a laptop is just too much. For example watching a show on tv you may get an idea and want to research it. Performance-wise it is very responsive. Seems on par or slightly better than the iPad we had in 2015. The Pictures are VERY clear and the shutter responds rapidly. I like the flexibility if storage and applications this has over the iPad. I can see why it is becoming so popular.,
"Great tablet.  Lightweight, thin, excellent screen, great sound.  But if you turn it off, then plug it in to recharge, the tablet turns itself back on.  It is very difficult to get the think to stay off while it is charging.  This seems to be a common problem with this tablet.  I hope it gets resolved soon.  ...If not for this problem, I'd give the tablet a rating of 5 stars.",
"very quick and smooth tablet .  the charger that came in the box was defective so both samsung and amazon sent me new ones.  very pleased with  Microsoft Word and all other features.  accessories I've added are: Vostrostone  Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 9.7 Keyboard case, KuGi ® High quality Ultra-thin Detachable Bluetooth Keyboard Stand Portfolio Case / Cover+ Free stylus & OTG cable for Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 9.7 tablet,  and, Tonor Bluetooth 3.0 Wireless Mouse Ultra Slim Portable Optical Mouse 800/1200/1600 DPI  both work great with Bluetooth and handy for typing and editing.  truly portable.  tablet Bluetooth also connects to my little speaker for Pandora or Netflix",
"Purchased for my son for Christmas.  I had purchased an earlier generation of this tablet for him about 4 years ago, and he was complaining that it is finally wearing out, so I chose to get him the same brand again.  I also had to buy him a new cover for this tablet, since the cover for the earlier model didn't fit this one - evidently, manufacturers change their dimensions marginally in one direction or another so you can't reuse your covers.  I must leave it to a more technologically savvy reviewer to discuss the performance, but suffice it to say that my son likes the Galaxy tablets very much.",
"This brand of tablet was highly recommended to me by 2 friends from work & I see why they also loved this tablet.  I have been using it now for 6 months & it has run flawlessly.  The weight of it feels just right & even with the case that I added to it: https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Keyboard-Samsung-Galaxy-920-007985/dp/B01798WM38/ref=cm_rdp_product , it is not too heavy.  Love the convenience of the additional storage card option.  This is my first Android product & it took me a bit to get used to the operational aspects.  I love it, my wife doesn't, so I guess we know who is using this most......easily recommended product overall.",
"I bought this tablet because my old one was running too slow. It gave me nearly five years. The tab S2 is very fast and responds quickly to commands. With 3 gigs of RAM, it can get in and out of programs very quickly. It has a high def display. The screen is absolutely beautiful. It is important to note that these new tablets are built similar to phones which is why they have both landscape and portrait displays. At 9.7 inches, the screen is more than big enough. Very good investment.",
"At the price I picked this up (<$200), it is great .  I work a professional job where I am meeting clients at their offices, and I use primary for basic office functions (sheets, docs, ect)/ email.  It works great for that, internet surfing, online shopping and watching videos.  Great screen quality and fast enough.

For slightly more intensive apps like games, this might not be ideal being that it is a few years old.  However, for a low price, this is a great economy tablet.",
"Bought one for my wife. Used it while setting it up for her. Why should she have all the fun. Bought one for myself. It is a superconvenient tool for the web, movies, pictures, reading books, all on a bright, highly pixelated screen for its size with outstanding clarity. I looked seriously at the 12.2 /Samsung but the nearly double price wasn't worth the small additional viewing area. Treat yourself in 2016. This is a beauty of a machine. Got mine in Wi-Fi, I have a Samsung Note smart phone for out of the house communications. Picture taking results are outstanding. Would have liked a longer lasting battery though. Samsung do something about this. I am on this honey most of the day. Teamed them both with a ProCase Folio Case Cover. Life is good.",
"Great screen, numerous options and configurations. Can hook up blue tooth mouse and keyboard for a laptop-like experience but Android is not optimized for that. Does not ever seem to get hung up when I run apps. A Windows 10 version would be even better. Great for media consumption as the screen is very rich and has high contrast. Web pages and video really pop.

Don't buy this for lots of productivty work. You need a full operating system for that. The Tab s2 9.7 is great at what it is - a Tablet for media consumption, email and web surfing. Don't try to make it what's it not and then hold it against it. Also - the 4:3 aspect ratio on a screen this size really helps make icons pop, and the interface big enough to click.",
"To be fair, I just received this two days ago. When it asks if I want to use Chrome or Internet, if I choose Chrome I get a pop up that says ""Unfortunately, Chrome has stopped."" Every time. No choices but to say Ok. It's not Ok. What is up with this? I also want to move my contacts over, but that hasn't happened yet, either. However, when I opened my Calendar for the first time, my husbands entire calendar was there! We have no connection except both use gmail. But how did his calendar get over and not mine? Another mystery. I love my Samsung Note 3 phone so thought it would be a seamless transition. Not so. I might be sending this back. Too bad as I bought a case and screen savers and keyboard to go with it.
Update: I had to uninstall and reinstall Chrome. Then I had to install another app to bring my contacts and gallery over. I'll use it today and see how it works.",
"Very happy with this purchase. Beautiful, light, fast and completely functional tablet at a great price. The HD Super AMOLED screen is a plus with its vivid colors and crisp images. It's refurbished, but you couldn't tell as it looks and works like new. I only give it four stars because it came with a generic charger that took at least seven or eight hours to charge from 0 to 100%. Bought a Samsung original charger at Best Buy and that solved the problem. Now it takes 3 to 4 hours to get a complete charge, which is normal considering this tablet doesn't have fast charging capabilities.100% satisfied!",
"I would have given this 5 starts except for two reasons:

1.) The plastic case is very slick. My old Nexus 10 had a bit of rubber on the case giving it a nice, natural grip when holding it. This tablet is just a slick plastic that I feel could slide out of my hands unless I am lifting it from the bottom.

2.) The speaker is pretty weak. There is only 1 and it is on the side, not even front facing. I get they did this to reduce bezel and width, but I felt like they could have added at least another speaker on the other side to give more a stereo effect.

Other than that this tablet is great. Bright, crisp screen. Very fast and responsive. Everything I am looking for to replace my old Nexus 10",
"A month in with this tablet and I'm generally really happy with it. Samsung's Android skin is extremely smooth, adds function without clouding the Android experience. Hardware powers through websites and apps without a second thought. The screen is gorgeous, deep colors and crisp blacks. Its difficult to look at my new LG G4 phone after looking at this screen; it just pales in comparison.

Big gripe, though: the battery on this thing... well, it sucks. Its really bad. It will not last more than a 3-4 hours of a lazy afternoon's heavy use (browsing imgur, a video here / there, web browsing). I have to turn it off whenever I'm not using it, otherwise it has to be tethered to it's charger.

Lastly, the thumb print scanner is not functional. Not worth the headache of setting it up. It fails no matter how carefully you replicate your initial placement. Would be nice to have an update where it continued to learn your print in the future, to make the scan more efficient.

All said and done, this is very likely the best Android tablet on the market.... for now. Google's Pixel C tablet comes out soon and I need to figure out a way to swap this Samsung for that new beast.",
"The tablet is very thin and light.  Very easy to hold with one hand for reading.  The screen is beautiful, and it has plenty of power for playing games.  There are just a couple of small things I wish they would have added to the tablet.  It doesn't seem to have any notification lights like you have on phones.  So, if I get messages when the sound is off, I don't know that they came in.  It also doesn't seem to have a vibrate setting, so notifications are either muted or noisy.  Having a Galaxy S5 phone, so I expected a USB3 charging port on the tablet, but it just had a regular micro-USB port.  The battery lasts a long time, and I've often charged it over night, so I'm not sure how long it takes to charge, or if having the USB3 port would make it charge faster.  Overall though, it's a great tablet.  I'm very happy with it.  I'd recommend it for sure.",
"Okay, its not a big secret that I am fans of the Samsung tablet lines. The screen looks great when I look at my pictures, there is no complaint there, the 4-3 ratio is a little bit weird unless you are a reader than it will work out well for you. Watching HD movies is not a bad thing, but you will notice that there is some wasted space. Apps, now when you star your device there are a bunch of choices to pick from. Yes there is pre installed software but most of it was things i was going to use anyways. there are two app stores to chose from but i normally just use the google one. The cameras, while not the best, I find that I dont normal use the cameras for much more than when I am video chatting with friends. I find that I normally use the tablet for a few hours at a time but never have to plug in unless I am going to sleep. I dont have battery issues so i guess I got lucky. The storage is never an issue bc you have the 32 or 64 gig and than you also have the option to add an SD card too.
All in all I find myself enjoying my new tablet and turned the slower one into a media device. Its worth the upgrade and if you are thinking about this one and wondering, Yes this is worth it.",
"This is a pathetic device. Since beginning the device had issues related to charging. The tablet used to display message to use original charger in order to charge it quickly. But this message was not coming very frequently. But now after 2 months, device is showing this message all the time and device is not getting charged at all. Its a big CHEATING by seller. I tried to charge it with my another samsung cable (original USB cable that came with my earlier samsung new device), but still this tablet is showing me the same message. It seems there definitely a problem with device. I would not recommend this to anyone. I want my refund back but amazon.com website is saying that their return policy is for only 30 days. I am feeling cheated. I want my refund back",
"If you are looking for a tablet and not obsessed with getting an iPad look no further!  I am very familiar with both iOS products and Android products.  I have owned a Nexus 7, Galaxy S5, Galaxy S4, Nexus 5, Nexus 7, iPhone 6, and iPad Air 2.  The Android products are what I choose to use at home and for personal use.

I debated for a long time between getting an Android tablet or a new iPad for my own personal use.  Based on my experience with Android devices, especially Samsung devices, I was concerned that the user experience and operating system would not be smooth.  My Galaxy S5 and S4 both experienced glitches and flaws that would sometimes frustrate me.  But Apple products are just so much more expensive and not easily customizable.  When Black Friday rolled around I was able to snatch up this tablet for $340; if the product turned out to be a dud I could always return it using Amazon's excellent return policy.

I don't know what Samsung did to resolve their issues but this tablet operates very smoothly; much better than my previous experience with their devices.  First there is absolutely no lag when swiping or loading apps; everything transitions smoothly and provides the kind of experience you would expect from an iOS device.  Secondly the device is very thin and extremely appealing; I chose to get the white version.  The battery life is excellent, I watched 6 hours of Netflix and still had plenty of battery life left.  Thirdly it is very customizable which is of course one of the primary reasons users choose Android in the first place.

You should get this device if you are on the market for a tablet and not obsessed with the idea of owning an Apple device.  I have a hard time imagining a better tablet on the market right now and especially for the price point.",
"I LOVE, no, I ADORE AMAZON.  Their customer service is EXCELLENT!!!!

First, let me say that I adore this tablet! The clarity in picture, and functions are amazing. I have been super happy with this product. I did A LOT of research before finally deciding on The Samsung Gallaxy Tab S2 with a 9.7"" screen and have not been disappointed with the performance of the tablet except for one thing...The charging port. I don't know if I got a defective port, or if this is a weak point for this product, we shall see.

I purchased this tablet about a year prior to the problems with the port. At the same time I purchased the tablet, I did purchase a two year protection plan through Square Trade for $40. Unfortunately, the warranty through Square Trade would not kick in until after the Samsung warranty ran out. I spent a very frustrating morning looking for HELP through Samsung regarding their warranty on the tablet and what to do when something went wrong with it. I found NOTHING. I looked online, made a few phone calls that lead no where. I thought it would be so easy, but it wasn't. Samsung needs to fix this. If you're going to offer a warranty that comes with your product, include information with the product so a customer may follow through with help in the event there is a problem. The information included with the tablet, gave me nothing but dead ends. I called the numbers in the booklet, and the numbers were not up to date and with no help whatsoever to resolve the issue.

My partner could see my frustration. I wasted time, and energy leading to dead ends, and he suggested I call Amazon for help. I thought there was no way Amazon would be able to help because it was an issue with the warranty through Samsung. NOT TRUE. Not only was my problem SOLVED, but Amazon sent me a REPLACEMENT tablet in TWO DAYS and gave me 30 days to send the tablet with the defective port back!

AMAZON STANDS BY THEIR PRODUCTS. GIVES THE MOST AMAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE SO THE ***CUSTOMER*** IS HAPPY WITH THEIR PURCHASE AND CAN PURCHASE WITH UTTER CONFIDENCE!!!!

I would NOT want to purchase items ANYWHERE ELSE if I can purchase them though AMAZON. I ALWAYS check Amazon FIRST before I purchase ANYTHING. The prices are competitive, the customer service is OUTSTANDING and without a doubt STELLAR!

Thank you AMAZON for turning around a very frustrating situation into an experience that ended up being RESOLVED painlessly. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!!!!",
"Love on first sight!!! this tablet is fantastic, fast, light, full of storage and Ive got it with a very good price. After just 7 months of use,  the original fast charger which is included stopped working. I'm not complaining the seller,  which by the way is very good, I'm complaining to the quality of Samsung and the rest of technology suppliers which are not cheap but have decrease the quality to an extend that we don't find a good quality device any more at reasonable prices.",
"Pros:
1. Very lightweight and comfortable to hold.
2. Great screen.
3. 4:3 screen ratio is so much more comfortable than 16:10 or 16:9 I used previously on tablets.
4. Very fast.

Cons:
1. No notification light. That's very surprising move from Samsung. Why remove it?
2. MicroUSB port is located far to the right, so it is highly unlikely there will be a charging cradle/holder for this tablet. Or it will be made specifically for this tablet and useless for all other devices because of weird location.
3. Headphone jack is located on the bottom just like on the phones like Samsung Galaxy S6, but it is great for phones and not so great for the tablets, especially this one as it will be used vertically most of the time... I wish it was on top like on iPads.
4. 3 physical buttons are not easy to use when using tablet horizontally. I wish there was an option to turn virtual buttons (app switch, home, back) in this mode.
5. No wireless charging. Small weight is nice but wireless charging at expense of some weight would be amazing.
6. Require case because of the camera unit.",
"Excellent tablet, even for the uninformed masses like myself.  It it so airily light, there is no arm strain from holding for hours.  Good battery life, likely to last you all day from average use.  I like the screen, both in output and dimensions though others may crave a 16:9 ratio I like the 4:3 more myself.  I love the expandable memory; just dumped a bunch of movies on there on a 128gb microsd card.  Very responsive performance, no percievable lag or slowdown at any point.  Worth the money.",
"WOW.  This tablet is crazy awesome!  I've used an iPad Air 2 for a while but I really wan't like iOS.  I like my iPhone but I played with a couple of android tablets at best buy and decided that was what I wanted for a tablet I use for reading comic books, books, and watching movies.

I bought a Fire HD 10 recently but the screen resolution and os stability was off, stuff worked but not very well.  I ordered this 9.7"" model after playing with a friend's 8.0"" model and it's just impressive.  It's fast, no stutter, the apps work, the screen is beautiful and it's light.  Even with a cover attached, it's still light.

It was kind of more expensive than I would have liked but I'm using it heavily and it's just great.",
"Before I purchased this tablet, I owned the Tab A 9.7 and loved it, except the lower resolution. Finally, I decided to step up and upgrade to the Tab2 S 9.7 and I am so glad I did as I state the reasons why below:

PROS/SPECIAL FEATURES...

+ Size/Weight/Ease oh holding this S2 9.7 - I had the Tab A 9.7 and before that Tab4 10.1. Both of my old tablets were THICKER and heavier compared to the S2. This tablet is feather light for a 9.7 and more comfortable to hold and to carry in my purse or backpack.

Screen Resolution, Brightness and Other Info – The resolution on this is 264 ppi compared to 132 ppi (pixels per inch) of Tab A 9.7. This is more than double the resolution. And note that the colors, pictures, videos, everything is so sharp and clear. The screen just pops with color! And I find it easy to read eBooks, watch videos, etc on this tablet. Even at a higher price for this tablet, I find that the tablet has been a wonderful purchase.

* The screen aspect ratio is 4:3 vs the 16:1 type of screen. For me, I like this 4:3 screen because I found that the webpages are easier to read and clearer, I did not have to scroll to the right. Also I found that the pictures on a website were easier to view. I compared this tablet with my older Tab 4 10.1 tablet on my frequent webpages and while I viewed this tablet, I could read the larger text better, read my eBooks much clearer, emails better etc. This is my personal discovery from my testing of this and comparing it to my older tablet.

+ Battery life/Speed – Good battery life, but not quite as good as my oldercaTab4 or TabA. For me, I have found that I am constantly on WiFi (Internet). One of the reasons is the screen is noticeably brighter (Tab S2 has more brightness nits). So I had to lower the brightness.
The tablet I find is quite responsive and peppy with no lagging. The Lollipop 5.1.1 runs this tablet wonderfully.

 WiFi Connecting/Speed of WiFi and MORE - This tablet connects SUPER quickly to my home WiFi and has never ever dropped the WIFi signal no matter where I am in my home. WiFi is VERY STRONG at 144mbps, vs 72mbps on my other tablets. Also, my internet loads super, super fast in all browsers that I tried.. And even when I am far from my router I still have 4.5 bars! I went to Settings, pressed on WiFi and it showed speed on my tablets. A,lso, to test this WiFi and compare it to my other Android devices, I went to the Playstore and got the free app called WiFi Analyzer. This is a MUST HAVE app for any Android device as it gives you a visual report on the WiFi strength of your tablet, phone etc.The Wifi speed on my Tab S2 is near double of what my TabA had.
Also, there is 32GB Ram in the Tab S2, this is double Ram of Tab A or Tab 4. And this tablet is super fast, no lagging at all!

+ SPECIAL INFO about INTERNET CONNECTION - Yes, this is a WiFi only, but when you are away from an WiFi internet hotspot location, there are ways to can get onto the internet such as MiFi and there are ways that you can purchase equipment so that you can have data when you do not have a WiFi hotspot available.

+ Internet & Webpage & Video Viewing - The stock browser does a wonderful job and it opens up webpages very fast. Also I tried Maxthon Browser and this worked very well yet I still prefer the Internet App. Also, I tried out the factory installed Chrome Browser and liked it OK, yet again, I went back the the stock Internet App (this is my preference). Note that the Playstore has many very good (FREE) internet browsers as Dolphin, Opera and many more!

+ EXTERNAL SLOT FOR MICRO SD CARD/Internal Storage. This is a must for me as I keep my personal files, photos, and music on my internal SD card. I installed a SanDisk 64GB SD card and it works great on this tablet and I placed my music and files on it and have plenty of space left. This tablet accepts up to 128GB SD card.
The internal storage of 32GB is double of my Tab A 9.7 or Tab 4 10.1 that have 16GB. Even after Android OS, factory apps, Facebook, Twitter, Kindle App and many more personal that I installed, I still have  just at 23GB of internal storage left!

- + Camera / Video Camera - This has a camera of 8MP with no flash on this camera, however, in good lighting the pictures came out much better had I expected. However, I rarely use this camera as I prefer to use my Nikon digital camera for my overall picture taking...the camera on this tablet is OK for backup camera, taking pictures to send in an email, etc). Do not expect the camera on this tablet to replace your digital camera since it does not have a flash.

+ Home Videos - The stock video player is OK and plays MOST home videos, however, may I suggest QQ Player (Free App from Playstore and the ONLY one I recommend as it plays every home video I tried)..

+ Music Player/Sound Quality - This model has the regular MUSIC App, which plays by playlists, songs, albums and even folders. Also there is Google Music app is pre-installed in this tablet and does a fine job. However, I installed the FREE app called Rocket Player from the Playstore and love this music player! As for sound quality - The best way to really enjoy music is through a high quality Bluetooth speaker or Bluetooth headset as the sound quality is superb this way and you can walk about your home listening to your music!

+ OTG USB Compatible - This tablet comes with a free OTG On the Go adapter cable. Just plug in your flash drive and you can copy files to the flash drive so easily or view files that are on the flash drive. *Note that portable external hard drives and portable DVD/CD drives will not work using OTG in this tablet because they require a lot of power.

CONS:
-  Battery life is so-so, not the best out there. In fact, I had close to 2 hours less per day on the Tab S2 over the Tab A!  But this is not a deal breaker for me as I still have enough battery time, and I always keep a spare charger in car/purse.

- Cost is pricey compared to Tab A line or the Tab 4 line. The price difference us about 100 dollars more for the Tab S2 9.7, however, for me, I believe that I received a very high end tablet, so it was worth what I paid.

Bottom line- Yes, this is a pricey tablet, however, I believe that the old saying that you get what you pay for is true. This is a very high quality tablet.

Should you buy this or the Tab A or a less expensive tablet in my opinion?  While this is an exceptional tablet, I also recommend a couple of others below....

TAB S2 ... Yes you may want to consider the Tab S2 9.7 if you want a higher resolution tablet with larger Internal space, 8MP camera and other high end features and you do not mind paying about 100 dollars more for higher end features etc.

TAB A 9.7... Yes if you want a good tablet for a reasonable price and do not mind lower resolution or 16GB Internal, 5 MP camera, etc, yet this is good because the battery lasted me 2 more hours daily than Tab S2. The TAB A is a wonderful tablet for the money) or Tab 4 10.1, or other lower priced tablet. A 5 MP camera us OK on a tablet for emergency pictures, 16GB Internal is OK if you watch how many apps you install on the internal storage.
Also, the Tab A is a GREAT BUY and excellent for someone new to tablets.

If you have questions, ask me in comments. I am kind of a techie person and will answer promptly.

Thank you for reading my review.",
Amazing laptop,
"First: The included charger was very small and the first screen I saw when I turned it on tells me ""You have plugged in a lower wattage power adapter. Your system will continue to work, but may not perform at its peak."" Really? $700 for a refurb and you cannot even send the proper charger? So I continue with the first boot and choose region and keyboard as usual then am greeted with a screen asking me for my Booking.com email address. What? I do not even know what booking.com is and there is no way to bypass this screen. See attached photos. The first screen informing me of the too small power adapter also had the Dell Service Tag number so I went to Dell to look that up. Turns out this service tag number has Dell ProSupport Plus until 25 September 2024. Wow. That seems too good to be true but I learned the machine needs a 65W adapter and you can see in the last photo the included adpater is only 45W. I might forgive the 45W adapter but I have never had a new Windows 10 machine ask me for my Booking.com email address upon the first boot. I cannot imagine what other surprises would await if I knew how to bypass that screen.

Update 9/29/2023: Thank goodness for Dell support. I was able to download and install the factory image from Dell so this laptop now appears to be okay and usable. I have no idea what the refurbish company had put on this machine but it was not a clean windows 10 pro image. HQCapital support has been very responsive (+1star) and is sending the correct charger for this machine.",
"I had it for a few weeks and then when I grabbed my backpack it came flying out and shattered. Totally My Fault, and that's why I just ordered another one. The $20 dollars I am saving I will use for the insurance. Great little Tablet and I am still not in the Cult Of Apple Products!!!",
"I am very excited to own this tablet.  the colors on screen are vived.  the speed to connect online is very good.
having received it about 2 weeks ago, I am still on the learning curve.  I use it every day to become more fluent in the use and potential of this tablet.",
"Great 7"" tablet running Android at a great price.. Has everything equivalent to my iPad, but more control over your device.. Only reason that I didn't rate it five stars is due to Samsung's design... The tablet is very slippery & slides out of your hands easily.. Definitely buy a tablet case/cover if you purchase this item!!",
Purchased this on sale so the price was great. I bought this to use as a universal remote thinking I could ditch the multiple remotes laying around. All of the control features are app based and I have not found the right one for my needs yet. Works well and holds a decent charge.,
"I bought this to replace a defective tablet of another brand, that I had purchased my grown daughter for Christmas.  It was a good price, and there have been NO problems at all.  She uses her tablet on a daily basis, carries it with her and she loves it.  Rarely does she ever use her laptop anymore as this does all she needs to do.  Would highly recommend this, and the price was VERY good, much lower that the box stores.",
"This was a gift to my son for Christmas!  I worried that the 7 inch might be too small, but he says it is just the right size for his busy graduate student lifestyle.  Not as bulky as some Tablets can be.  We added a leather case with a wireless keyboard to complete the gift.  He couldn't be happier.  It's fast, it's efficient, it has a lot of features.  Couldn't be happier with this purchase.  Well worth the money!",
"The samsung tab 3 is a great tablet. I was searching for a relatively small tablet for portability. Don't let the size (7 in) deter you. The screen clarity and resolution are top notch. I typically use this tablet in conjunction with video viewing apps such as espn, att uverse, etc. The small size allows you to keep up with sports games and tv shows while grilling, cooking, or doing household chores. This was by far my best electronics purchase of 2014.",
"I do love my iPad, but I will say for something small and portable, this is very good. Had a great price point and fits good in my hand. Registration is a bit of a pain, and there is no iHeart radio in the samsung app store, but it still has a majority of the other major apps.",
I was worried the 7 inch screen wouldn't be big enough but it's perfect and easy to stash in my coat pocket and carry with me.  I useit to follow the stock market during the day at work and it connects easily to wifi wherever I am.  I didn't think I would like the onscreen keyboard and would need a separate Bluetooth keyboard but so far it's not been an issue for me.  I highly recommend this tablet and I think you'll really enjoy it.,
"This thing is impressive. I know it is now outdated, but I thought it is sometimes nice to hear the long term satisfaction.  My Jr High boy has had this for a year and a half. He takes care of his stuff, but this thing has performed flawlessly for that long. Still works fantastic. I am really impressed. He puts hours and hours on it. Games, netflix, texting, blah blah blah. Seriously, I see why people like this.",
"I have read review after review about what is the best tablet. I have to say for the price this one was perfect for what I needed it for. I have not experienced any issues with my tablet picking up Wi-Fi or lagging. It does what I need it to do when I need it done. I haven't weighed it down with too many apps so that my be a factor. I use it more for leisure if that helps, and I am currently happy with my tablet.",
"i gave it a 5 star rating because I was really impressed. It offers so much more than the Kindle. I like thst its quite user friendly. I was worried about the color, because I really wanted a black and the white one looked like a toy, so I was happy to see that the gold-brown, was dark enough and so kept the sleek, sophisticated image. I would recommend this product to anyone who is interested in having a light mini computer at his or her fingertips.",
"This tablet is very practical and comfortable to use, helped me a lot to synchronize multiple computers in my house with the apps that I downloaded, and you can download an endless number of applications to be used, I have no complaints of this tablet, it has simplified my many of my tasks both at home and at work.",
"Initially, I loved it, but it does have some serious design flaws.

The most serious design flaw is that the receptacle for the power cord is not well secured to the housing, and eventually (as in 10 months) it got pushed inside the device, so that it can't be charged, and therefore can't be used.

The other problems with it are that the WiFi seems very slow, and that the ""return to previous screen"" button is placed just where you want to put your hand to hold the device, so that programs quit seemingly at random.",
"I own a TAB2 and I must say that the performance is the same. However if you dont have a TAB 2 get this since the design is superior. the TAB3 gives a more sturdy hold since i feel like my TAB2 can roll out of my hand with its rounded smmoth design, not so with the TAB3. Also with the TAB3 actual buttons for home and back its more convenient than the TAB2 which had a display touch screen home button which can be a hassle with screen rotation.",
"I ordered 3 Tabs for presents. 2 work fine, but 1 Tab flickers when the back light setting is turned down to its lowest setting. It was sent back to Samsung. If 1 out of 3 Tabs had this problem, I feel there is a pretty good chance of getting one that doesn't preform properly. The other 2 are nice.",
"I got this product pretty fast in the mail practically ""brand new"". The only thing wrong was a dent in the packaging. I'm still learning how to use it but this was a good buy. My only cons on this product so far would be that the screen sometimes is very sensitive but overall I'm satisfied with the product I received.",
"Device challenged, I bought this tablet after reviewing the list of devices that would support a ""Square or Jax"".  It does not support these e-commerce additions because it was the wrong version.  I was disappointed but realized I could input credit cards manually so decided to keep it and upgrade later.  However, my Son may be right, Apple products may be more suitable.  I noticed it has a pretty short battery life.  Not what I had hoped for and wish I hadn't bought another one at the same time as a gift.  Think I'll return the second one.",
"I am sorry I waited so long to buy one. However, I'm trying to figure out why there is no multi- screen. I am using it as a wireless keyboard and mouse in connection with my laptop when I'm watching in bed. I am also using it as a remote connection so I can use my laptop anywhere. It works great.",
Aside from no flash this is a great tablet. Links up to wifi with no problem. Easy to use with nice sounding speakers and even better sound with headsets. HD picture is great. You can load lots of music and pics on SD Card. Apps install quickly. If you want a tablet to use with wifi only consider this one.,
"A pretty nifty little gadget. It's not a cellphone, it's not a pc, it's the perfect tablet. It fits comfortably on your hand and is not tiresome to hold but is not too small either.

With this one I got an issue. One night it discharged completely and the next day it didn't wanted to turn on. Even after I left it charging for a long time. The next day I brought it to work and connected it to the pc for a long time. It worked perfectly fine afterwards.",
"This tablet is great. Only wish I could have afforded a bigger screen version, and  I think it should come standard with a screen saver already on it . I bought my kid a Dell and it came with one already on it, perfectly
perhaps tablet makers can either follow suit or make it an option. An option that they could charge an additional, nominal fee, of course
aside from that I'm very well pleased with this tablet. It does all I need and more. Always been a Samsung fan.",
When I received this item it was sealed in its original box as if it was brand new.  Everything was there no problems with the devise and I have used it everyday since I received it.  It is my alarm/nightstand/music desk clock.  I love the color.  I bought an Otterbox outside case with stand and it is the best tablet I have seen or had.  Fast and I can sync it with my Samsung Galaxy S4 cell phone and Dell Laptop.  It's great at this price.,
"Is a very good tablet sometimes freeze and need to restart when I use Google Maps and try to use Street View. This 7 inch model does not allow to use multi-user I don't know why this feature is very important nowadays, because I bought this tablet for all my family and each one has their own account. But is OK for this moment.",
"I'm a Mac person. iPhone, iPad, iMac, Macbook.  I'm taking a class in cloud computing and we are working on Google drive.  I thought I'd buy an android device.  I thought android would be more compatible with all the google apps.

This Tab3 is really clunky.  I found it s-l-o-w.  While supposedly running a 1.2gb processor and 8gb flash memory and 1gb memory.  It became really annoying while trying to open an app, then it would automatically close.

I tried to load some music on it.  I found on Youtube, a suggestion to connect it as an external drive than upload.  I unloaded one album, but could never find the music.  Another suggestion was to download an app called 'Kies' -  Kies asks if I wanted ALL my music, and i checked 'NO' I then downloaded one album, when I opened my Galaxy Tab3, I couldn't find the music, but i did find my entire iPhoto library.

Trying to delete my photos was impossible, unless I deleted them one at a time.  I had over 4,000 photos uploaded.

Finally getting so frustrated, I wiped it, reset to original condition, repacked it and sent it back to Amazon.",
"I've had this tablet for four months, and barely have the energy to try to use it. To wake it up, I have to press the button repeatedly, or even try the power button. Eventually it does turn on, and that's when the challenge begins.

Most times I am trying to watch a video, the tablet freezes and makes a maddening noise. The only way I was able to stop it was by trying to turn it off repeatedly, since I couldn't figure out how to open it and remove the battery.

Typing anything when browsing the internet is a challenge. I press a letter and it takes a few seconds for the letter to be entered. And it freezes or opens other pages when I simply get my finger too close too a link. If I try the back button, it usually doesn't work or simply kicks me out of the internet.

I should clarify that I have not overloaded my tablet with apps. The internal memory has more than half left. Samsung support suggested I clear my internet apps completely, but this didn't work. I simply hate this product and will have to try to get it replaced or just throw it out the window.",
Seen some bad reviews for this.  I have to say that I don't agree this tab is great.  If you are familiar with the Android system then the useage of this tab should be no problem at all.  If you have a gmail account it will sync with it and load all apps and info to it that you have on other Android devices.  It does have instructions but like all Samsung products you have to go online to get the manual as that's how they do it to save paper.,
Excelente tab,
"The galaxy tab 3 7"" is quite a good gadget. It meets most of my expectations though I'm still acquainting myself with it. I give it a 4-star rating because I am yet to fully explore all its features and do not know what I will find and because the battery life though ok, is not quite as good as I expect it to be.",
"I was very satisfied with my Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 until it fell out of my hand and the face shattered.  I think the best improvement that can be made is to make the face shatter proof.
This tablet takes beautiful pictures and one of the features that I like the most is that it can control any TV.  On, off and change channels.",
I wanted to get a tablet and after looking around I chose the Samsung.  This 7 inch is small enough for my handbag and light compared to the others.  Amazon was the only place I could get the brown one.  I can't say much more as I haven't really got into it yet but the kids are doing fine.  I think if I was going to use it for pramarily for reading I would get the 8 inch but the 8 is a little heavier so it would be a trade off.,
"I ordered the Gold-Brown one but received the black in instead, which was the first time I ever had that problem.  I have another Galaxy through Sprint that I pay $15.00 a month for.  This has no monthly fee and works great with my internet service inside my home or outside.  I order this one for my daughter  as well as Chromecast, she loves it!",
"Met all expectations and research prior to buying. Easy to set up and intuitive, user friendly. My wife wanted this Galaxy Tab 3  for health care provider applications. She likes it a lot better than previous devices like Palm Pad. This 7"" is a very good size for transport and screen viewing. Excellent resolution and pretty generous memory. Even with Epocrates healthcare software loaded, I have not needed to install a memory card that is available. So far, no issues with battery life either, a pleasant outcome. A lot of capability for under $200. I highly recommend.",
"I was hoping the other reviews about picking up the wifi just had to do with other peoples wifi connections, but it is doing the same with mines as well. I have perfect internet at my house, but you have to be close to the router in order to get good signal otherwise is very slow.  Love that you can print from this tab, which is a plus",
"its $150, what are you expecting, it works great for what i wanted it for, but compared to my galaxy s3, the camera is worse, the screen has a lower resolution, it is noticeably slower, and it has less ram, however it does have a nice screen, and an infared blaster that can be used as a remote control for your tv, or others if you want to have fun.",
"I received my Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 and had no problems setting it up. Two days later when I went to use it the screen was frozen and would not allow to use the tablet.

I made three calls to the Samsung Tech support people This did NO GOOD at all. I felt they were lacking in solving the problem. Their answer was "" you need to send it in for service"" I called Amazon and they provided me the option of a refund or a new device.

In all fairness I elected to try the tablet. I can only say Amazon is the BEST. I will post  a updated review.",
"This is my first time using something other than an apple product and I love it.  I have been an iphone and ipad user since they arrived on the scene and have been drinking the cool aid ever since .  My experiment with Samdsung galaxy has been an eye opener.  The Tab 3 7 inch works great for me.  I do recommend getting versions with built in wifi.  This version is great around the house and anywhere wifi is available.  ALL stars from me.  Samsung Galaxy,  out of the park.  M",
"I did what I thought was a good deal of research before buying this. Unfortunately, none of the review articles (and certainly not the Samsung site) will let you know that this device will not work with many of the accessories. Most important is the lack of an HDMI connection via MHL/micro-USB port (I also wasn't able to get any of the micro USB to USB connectors to work with this device and couldn't get the Peel remote to control the TV). I didn't find this out until I had already bought a MHL/micro-USB to HDMI connection and tried to get it to work. Don't bother, it wont. If you want to attempt to connect this device to a television, there is no good way that I can think of. Apparently the 8 and 10.1 models have this capability. Nothing on the Amazon or Samsung websites point out this discrepancy. Even the older (Tab 2 models) can be connected via a dock, not the Tab 3 7-inch though. Returning my 7 inch tablet as a result.",
I purchased for just for the sole purpose of playing games for my 5 yr old daughter..and watching movies in the car..it is alittle sluggish at times..not the fastest..but I knew that from watching reviews and the price..but would recommend to others..great for the price and good function..I have used it as a big Navi screen on a small trip..worked great..I jus turn on my Wifi on my phone and good to go..,
"Sadly, I didn't read all the reviews or the description carefully enough, or else I would have known that 8GB wasn't going to be enough. My son has downloaded about 15 apps, and that's all she wrote. Internal memory is almost full, and since you can't move apps to the SD card, well, for every new app he wants to download, we'll have to uninstall one. Of course you can't uninstall all the preloaded crap (why do they keep doing that to us?!).

As for the rest, the picture is beautiful and great for watching Netflix. The empty SD card is waiting for when my son is interested in taking pictures and listening to music.",
"It's a great machine when it's working fine, just like my Galaxy 3 phone but has a tendency to freeze often when playing games and has to be restarted.  It was given to my wife as a gift and she started to complain about the freezing.  When playing Angry Birds it acts kinda whacky.  I know that doesnt say much except that Angry Birds becomes un-playable.  The screen flashes, the birds do not react to the correct finger movements and go off in the opposite direction.  When play slots it will just freeze.  I hoping that Samsung will address this issue and put out a software patch to fix this soon.",
"We bought two tablets for our daughters for Christmas.  Each received the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 (7 inch).  Our daughters are 11 and 9.  It was a perfect gift.  First, the price was very reasonable for a quality product.  They use their tablets each day playing games, skyping with relatives and friends, email, etc.  And what I love most is that they enjoy it.  It was hard to justify buying an ipad for them when the Samsung offers everything for them that an ipad would.  And our experience with all Samsung products has been a good one.",
"I bought this to use with my credit card reader for my business and now I don't really need it. I decided to keep it to put my finished photography pics on it to show people. After 2 weeks I finally figured out how to do that and I'm fairly good with computers. Unless you have readily available wi-fi, it's pretty useless.There's no real manual for it. What happened to manuals anyway? It has apps I don't want, need or can't figure out a use for. It seems like every app has to go thru google + and who likes google +? The screen is clear and the speakers are OK. I feel like I bought an expensive radio.",
The tablet is great it works very close to my samsung phone the only reason I didn't give 5 stars is I wish I could move apps over to as  card without having to connect to computer.I thought I could but my mistake in assuming all samsung android devices were alike.I got the 8GB but I would highly recommend 16GBP especially if u like to download lots of games but overall the tablet is a good tablet,
"Within 2 weeks of giving this as a gift to my dad who is retired - he has been enchanted with all the features, the convenience.  He loves that with a wireless router he can sit in the living room with mom  and play his games, read his e-mails and check his stocks and not have to sit alone in his office at his computer.  The quality is good and with all the apps the opportunities to learn and discover is endless. Dad is 81 and his mind is very, very sharp.  This will keep his mind active and healthy.  He loves it!",
I wanted this tablet cause I figured It would be like my phone and it is the problom is its almost exactly like the phone its to restricted from certain on the web I wanted a tablet that was more like a laptop like my last one. I like it but I dont love it it often freezes and the worst freeze and kicks me out of what im doing. It has a fairly slow response on almost everything but otherwise its ok. I think it has a pretty good battery life.  But if I could I'd probably get something else. Maybe my expectations were to high but thats the product I have so im slightly disappointed.,
"This was a simple and elegant solution for my wife.  She wanted a pad, but did not want to have a data plan.  She uses it on our WiFi at home and at her office.  She uses it mainly for Google searches, e-mail (Yahoo), and Facebook.  It does all of that well.  For most other computer work she uses the home computer, which is in heavy competition with my daughter using it very often.  Anyway, I've been using a Galaxy 3s phone for some time, and It appears to be the same high quality item, essentially working like a great big smart phone.",
"Super excited about my first tab, and it'll be just like my phone, which I freaking love. Yeah...Not so much. It's glichy and slow, and has done some really concerning things- like shut down and reboot and be at factory settings with none of my purchased apps! I rebooted it, and they were magically there. Just a weird thing. Also, none of the accessories I've bought for it fit. (and I made sure they were the right ones!) They're all to big and floppy, with holes in the wrong place. I love my galaxy phone, with all my heart. I just wish my tab was as fast and with it as my phone. It's the slow stupid version it seems. Poopy.",
"I have been viewing email, web articles, etc on my Samsung phone. I decided I wanted a bigger screen, so bought the tablet. I  looked at Kindles and IPads, but decided I wanted to stay with Samsung. The tablet feels very familiar after using the phone for some time (also have good luck with 3 Samsung TVs.). I got the WiFi version as I can use the Samsung phone as my WiFi hub to the web.. and I always have my phone. Works great. It uses our home wifi when I'm home and the phone when I'm out. Still learning to use various things, but recommend the tablet without reservation.",
"This tablet is great, I bought 2 of them, one for my girlfriend and the other one for me. They're great for web browsing and watching videos.
The tablet is not the fastest on the market but first I want to use it and test it before purchasing a bigger/faster one.

The only complain I have is that I bought 2 Items and neither of them arrived in it's original box but in a plastic-cardboard pseudo-box, the description said that everything was in like-new condition and all the manuals were included but for one tablet they were missing... One tablet had only minor cosmetic details on the back.",
"I bought it because I got tired of lugging around a heavy laptop on vacation. It is very small, lightweight and convenient. It doesn't have the computing power of a laptop, but the display is sharp and high quality. I don't have a smartphone, so it is my first experience with apps too. I find them problematic, for example flash is NOT supported by Android, so most videos won't play. That sucks, but it's not Samsung's fault. Overall I am very happy with the purchase.",
"I really love this ! It charges pretty quick and the battery lasts a long time...
I can watch movies great pix.. read books play games I also listen to books on the road !
and I am sure it does a ton more !  I haven't put my music on it yet.. I hardly ever use my ipod anymore since I got this ! The only thing it doesn't have is facetime which is a bummer but I can Skype ,,, anyway its great !",
"For the money, this is hands down one great device. It works smoothly and seamlessly. But it doesn't do all those wonderful things anyone owning an iPad or similar will have become used to. Games and apps are great, google play is getting there now, and this thing is sturdy and easy to handle. Can't do iTunes of course, and can't play Amazon movies either - which for me is a big disappointment. My kid loves it, also cause its compact and easy to carry around.",
"Samsung is making leaps and bounds above the others! I bought one of these for my wife after she was constantly complaining about how much she hated my smartphone! She quickly learned Android so she could play games and the like, and now SHE has a smart phone! Next, I bought another for my Grandson, He's ten and it's time he had his own computer, I warned him it's fragile and got him a case telling him, if you break it it's gone and won't be replaced! Another lesson for him that is working. He's keeping his grades up (straight A's) and he's taken good care of the machine he loves. I couldn't be happier!",
"I already had a Tab3, and love using it.  It's fast, has a very clear and bright hi-res display, and is priced right!  My kids wanted their own tablets for Christmas, and I cannot justify the iPad mini for kids, so these Tab 3 units fit the bill nicely.  I'm not too concerned about the 8GB onboard memory, because I can install 64GB microSD cards, and have more than is needed.

I'm really picky about devices like this, so giving 5 stars is a big deal, but I am really impressed with Samsung.  I also have a Samsung Galaxy S4 phone, and they are laid out identically.  That's a bonus!",
"This tablet lasted about three years until the battery just gave out on me. I mean, it's fairly good for it's price. Nothing really to complain about except that the battery completely died. Worth it, I think. I would buy it again, but I'm trying something a little more expensive to see how I like it. Worth the purchase, though, if you just need a tablet to read or watch netflix in bed!",
"Pros: The tablet works well, very clear, just the right size to carry around without adding too much weight. Its been 3 days but i love it
Cons: Amazon promises to ""Pre-loaded with free content including Hulu Plus membership, Google Play credit and Boingo Wi-Fi Access"" Not true! theyre actually referring to the Free memberships we already get, there is no added benefit. Notice they dont even mention how much the google play credit will be. It was all very sneaky of Amazon and I am very surprised and disappointed with them",
"I got this so I could put my textbooks on it and carry it to class. I wanted something lighter than my laptop. It has been working pretty well. I have a problem  with one textbook it is very sluggish, but it is a very large textbook and the other 3 do not have that problem. I used Google drive to put them there. I liked that all the apps from my phone went onto the Tab. It has been pretty good. I'm still learning some things but so far I'm happy",
"This was a gift for my wife. I have a Galaxy 2, and she had a Nook, but wanted to be able to get Kindle Books.  She has been delighted with her Galaxy 3.  It is everything that she wanted and more.  I pointed out some apps that I thought that she would like to have, and she has been using the Galaxy even more than she thought she would.  This was one of the best gifts that I have given her in our many years of marriage.",
"I'm a Apple user that is being converted to Samsung.  Family got the phones so I decided to try out this tablet.  I really like it and will be adding a galaxy phone to go with it soon.
Pros:  Bigger; nuff said.  Really like the homescreens and especially the ""widgets"" that have active content on them,  unlike just the icons only like Apple does.  Plus the Google Play store (read: Apple App store) gives away free stuff!

Cons: Well, it could be bigger.  The screen seems to attract lint and junk. Wish I could change the volume on the screen instead of having to do it with the buttons on the side.",
"I love the galaxy s4 and galaxy tab 10.1.  So I thought the 7.0 tab would work well for my 9 year old daughter.  This tab was a disappointment.  Problems included random crashes, sluggishness,  and the datetime would reset everytime the device was restarted.  Loading web pages was very slow... so were games.

I was planning on returning to amazon, but decided to do a little troubleshooting first, which included: factory reset, clearing the device cache, turning off extra features like the lock screen, power saving (which limited CPU), auto updates, and widgets.

I also discovered a flaw in the plastic around the on/off switch.  It was sticking ""on"" sometimes, causing the device to randomly reboot.

It's working better now.  As for quality, it's ok now but not in the same league as the other galaxy devices.  I'd say a better price should be $125.  I wouldn't recommend if you pay more than that.  Spend a little extra and get a better tab.  I wish we had gotten a nexus or another galaxy tab 3 10.1, given that I had to spend at least 4 hours troubleshooting the device.",
"So I got 2 of these (8gb model) for my kids for christmas this year.  By the day after Christmas one of them was already completely out of internal memory after downloading less than 20 apps / games.  That is because over 4gb is used for the OS and other bloatware that cant be removed.  So that leaves less than 4 gb left for apps, photos, videos, etc which goes pretty fast.  My sone had 1 game that was taking up over 1Gb. Now, I thought the external SD card would solve our issue so I went out and got a 16gb card.  That's when I found out Samsung disables the option to install / move apps onto the external SD card. It's only for photos and video which doesn't help the apps problem. So 2 days after turning it on for the first time, we're already into deleting apps to make space mode. Given the price, there are other tablets that offer a better value in my opinion.

Overall a decent tablet otherwise. I would rate higher if Samsung would remove the restriction on putting apps on the SD card.  Other vendors android based tablets allow this.",
"I have owned and used many Samsung products and have been happy with all of them in the past.  I wanted an affordable and reliable android tablet for around the house to replace an Original Kindle Fire,  so I purchased the Galaxy Tab 3.

After I received the Galaxy Tab 3 and started using it,  I noticed how sluggish the interface was in comparison to other devices that I have used such as the Kindle Fire HD and the iPad Mini.  It also did not feel as ""solid"" as some other the other devices I was used to.  Under normal use such as web browsing or streaming movies, it got hot to the touch.  I also had to frequently reboot the unit to keep it responsive.

Unfortunately, After about a month after purchase, the unit locked up and shut down to a black screen.  It would not come back on after that.  I have had to send it back for warranty repair and am anxiously awaiting the results of the repair.

Other Samsung tablets may be better and may be worth the money.  However, I can not recommend this unit.",
The tablet is awesome! Fast and very nice resolution screen! I used it mainly for movies and games like clash of clans! But after a year the tablet turned off by its self! I search this issue and apparently this model has the battery poorly atached they say it can be easily fix placing an electric black tape over the battery.... But I'm scare of opening it so thats what I dint use it anymore... But for the price I recommend it!!!,
"Since I couldn't convince him to get himself a new computer or laptop, I gave this to my husband for Christmas and he loves it. We have Samsung phones so that made it easier for him to navigate. Wanted something for him to be able to play his videos and listen to his music and this is perfect. It's also easier for him to read with the bigger screen. This was not intended for work purposes, strictly entertainment, so it does everything he needs it to do. It came in a couple of weeks before Christmas so I was able to play around on it myself and familiarize myself before giving it to him on Christmas day. Great gift. Now I'll have to think about getting one for myself.",
"Bought it for my son's birthday and he is in love with it. One of the features that he liked the most is the ability to video chat with me whenever he has WIFI access. 'Google Hang out', allows him to talk to anyone who has the 'Google hang out' app on their smart phone. All that is required is a Gmail account. It also had a neat app called Watch-On, this app acts as a remote control and can change channels, change the volume, power the TV and set top box on/off. Very cool app, very cool tablet, would purchase another one.",
"I have Nook, Kindle, and iPad, too, and find the Samsung to compare favorably except for its small size.  Unfortunately, it does not do what I bought it for which was to mirror to my Samsung TV and to act as a touch remote.  It will send saved video and photos to the tv but it will not mirror live streaming data or web browsing.  If you want to do.that buy the 8"" tablet.  Apps download easily and I have not yet found any that are incompatible.  Don't worry about color choices if you are going to use a cover.",
"well the tablet went dead just over a year , I bought it for my son who was never on it for any length of time just to play games. it looked new when we got it , and worked fine. then after a few month it would freeze up and make a noise. I own a galaxy tab 4 and never had issue with Samsung devices. it was never dropped so I am not sure what happen . I think I should  have had more years from this . I am now left to get a new one and so dissapointed",
"The reason I gave it 4 stars because it didn't send what it advertised, it says gold/brown, it is black and silver, so if you say it is something it should be that,  but it works and I am happy with it. if you play on it a long time use power saver for the brightness because it will heat up on you.  but it does what I need it to do, music games and video. I watch my mp4's or Netflix and HULU just fine. graphics looks good..",
"I purchased this tablet as a gift for my sister's boyfriend who lives in New Zealand, so naturally global shipping was the key driver in my purchasing decision.  He says he loves the tablet, but that he wishes it wasn't just for wifi (my mistake).  It seemed like a really good price for what it had to offer, and I liked that it has the ability to add more memory storage later if he needs it.  Overall, the tablet makes it easier for us to Skype and stay in touch, which was the ultimate goal.",
"Works pretty good.  Wife is not a tablet person but she likes it.  Kids love it.  I have had the Tab 2 for a while and find it faster than the newer Tab 3.  Tab 3 lags behind inputs and is a little glitchy.  Games are a little jerky, lessor quality video card or something I guess.  Tab 2 has upgraded Android 4.2.2 but Tab 3 is stuck at 4.1.2.  Don't know if an update will come any time soon.  I have rooted the Tab 3 to get rid of the bloatware... so far so good I guess.",
"Pros:
* Great price on sale
* Nice look & feel
* Works well for our simple needs
* Android

Cons:
* A little underpowered, definitely feel some lag.
* Battery life. But that's expected, nothing unusual.
* Front camera is underwhelming, especially since Skype was one of the main reasons for buying this.
* Registration took several tries, was a bit annoying.

Definitely the best value at this price range. But if we were to do it all over again, might have spent a few $ more on a Nexus 7. But this was bought as a gift and the recipient is very happy with it.",
"I've just had mine for a couple of days, but so far, so good.  I did find a User's manual online, and that's much easier to read than the one that came in the box. I don't think anyone has mentioned that before.  I have a big tablet, and use it mainly for reading and playing games, but it is a little heavy for my purse, so now I am brushing up on things I just never bothered to learn because I was using the first for different things.  I am having a little trouble getting Prime to recognize that I have two, but I probably missed something in the directions..  One comment.  I didn't think I wanted white, but was confused by the color gold-brown.  I still am confused.  To me it looks black.",
"I ordered 3 of these tablets for my family and so far they've been great.
Games, social apps, streaming services all perform above average. I almost went for an off brand tablet but then I realized that this was not that much more expensive for what I needed them for. My kids love them and stay glued to them for hours(after homework of course).
I know they come out with a new model every year or so but in the mean time this will do then I'll probably upgrade to the new models when the time comes. Samsung and Android have made wonderful technology and I can't wait to see what's next.",
"I bought this for my 9 year old. This is the second child we have bought one of these for. We have had no problems with it's functionality. They use it for mostly playing games, some internet searching and picture/video taking. We have had a problem using the additional sd storage.We used up all the internal memory and can't get the sd card to store anything. According to an internet search, you need to root the tablet. Not being much of a computer savy person, we haven't figured out how to do that, so we just delete things as we want to use more space. Overall satisfied, except for the storage issue",
"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my niece and as such I am unable to personally attest to the functionality of this tablet or how it compares to others.  All I can say is that 2 weeks after Christmas my niece is still thrilled with this gift and thanks me profusely for it every time I see her.  I didn't know at the time when I purchased it that she is a fan of Samsung and already has a Galaxy phone, so I got really lucky there.  She is a bit more tech savvy than I am, so based on her pleasure and enjoyment of this product I would recommend it.",
So I've had this tablet for a few days noe to play around with it and I must say I  pretty im pressed with  it so far. I did get it for a few different reasons like school and entertainment. Haven't done the school thing yet but  I have checked out some movies and I almost freaked out because the first movie I chose was from '92 and it was very poor quality but I chose a different movie from that same era and it was digitally remastered and it was much better. I tried a few more and Im satisfied with this tablet. It can be a bit sluggish at times but Im diggin it.,
"Este dispositivo llego a tiempo y en las condiciones que ofreció Amazon, el color y la nitidez de la pantalla son increibles, muchas aplicaciones para todos los gustos y sobre todo la aplicacion de hablar directamente al equipo lo hace genial. Lo unico que extrañé es que no tiene SIM card, con eso seria completo, por eso no le doy un 5.

This device arrived on time and under the conditions offered Amazon, color and sharpness of the display are incredible, many applications for every taste and especially the application to talk directly to the equipment makes it great. The only thing I missed is that no has SIM card, with that would be complete, for this I not give it a 5.",
"It's a great tablet. The perfect size; you can easily hold it in one had which is ideal for reading. The screen has great resolution and the battery seems to last forever. The reason it has a four star rating is because, like everything else, it has its faults. I doesn't have S Beam, so I couldn't transfer files from my S3, but that was an easy fix, I just sent them using Bluetooth. It still doesn't make sense that it doesn't have it though. Another thing I didn't like is that even though all my apps are set to be updated manually it updates them automatically, which can be kind of annoying. Other than that it's an awesome tablet that I highly recommend. :)",
"Bought two of these refurbished, huge mistake. Lasted only a few months, like 3 or 4, before the charging ports failed within days of each other. It wouldn't charge or power on at all. After taking it too shop to get fixed, I discovered that certain versions of these tablets have a charging port that cannot be replaced. Waste of money and I had to buy new tablets, but I did purchase a 2 yr warranty this time! The tablets are great so the tablet itself is a 4 star product, but I wouldn't buy any refurbished from Amazon sellers!!!! I bought two different models from two different sellers and they both suffered the same problem about a week or two apart.",
"Ok. I'm a first time tablet owner. I must say that so far my experience has been great with this tablet! Understanding that because of the low price you'll not get the ""best"" features but beside that everything is workable. The back camera is not good but I didn't buy the tablet for the camera (i own a digital camera). Front facing camera gets the job done well. Battery life is excellent (can go 24 hrs + without charging.... depending on usage). I will have to expand the memory however. I'm able to stream my movies and use other flash content after downloading the adobe flash player. No glitches experienced as yet. I've purchased one for myself and 2 for my sister and father. Will update after another month or so of usage.",
"I bought this a year ago and tried to like it.  The tablet itself works like it is suppose to.  I just am not used to android so it was not for me.  I gave it to my daughter who has an android phone and she loves it.  I think it is probably one of the better quality low cost tablets and if you are not already used to the I-pads and phones then I am sure it would be fine.  A couple things worth mentioning are I thought the battery run time was kind of short, and it is finicky about wanting its oem charger.  The screen quality is great and it is nice that it has the micro sd card slot.",
"Arrived in a timely manner and was packaged well, the only comment is that the tape on the box that states if this is unsealed return the product. I didn't and everything is fine but makes me wonder why it was. This was a gift for my son who is 10 so I didn't want to spend top dollar in case of accidents and such. He uses it everyday and is loving the fact that he can watch Netflixs on it. I am not a techie so I can't get into all that, but I have noticed that while playing games on it it's a little slow to respond to play. He doesn't utilize all the tablet is able to do but it does everything he wanted one for. Good item for the money and a good starter tablet for a young user.",
"Ok so 8gb isn't enough for me, after awhile the lack of space slows the hardware down (as with most things)

I brought this for myself as a belated birthday present
The operating system is great runs smooth and vividly.
My favorite feature is the S Voice (It's samsung's version of Siri), just wish there was an option to make it masculine.

It charges fast which I really like and it lasts long. Normally I would unplug it around 11am and won't plug it back in until 4-6am , with extensive use.

Skype does run the battery down a bit.
So far the power saver feature causes freezing with facebook messenger and skype.

It's great for spanish lessons and bookclub reading

Just brought my mum one for my birthday yesterday this way she could watch her favorite shows on the go.
No real problems, other than memory but that is a simple fix. Microsd cards go on sale around back to school deals.

Try it out and see for yourself, it's a great tab for a great price.

p.s. you can control the font size so there's no true ""size"" problem.",
"UPDATE:  I've now used the tablet and it's pretty good - rating upgraded.  It seems to work fine for everything I've used it for.  The problem noted below (Linux/USB Mass storage) turns out to be Android 4.x related, not just Samsung.  Newer Linuxes have MTP drivers that make it useable, at least in Nautilus.  Based on all this, rating upgraded.

OLDER:
I have not used the tablet yet.  But I found this out when I went to copy files:  LINUX Users beware - you cannot connect this to your Linux machine and transfer files!  The phone has Windows-only drivers on it, so you can (usually) connect it to Windows and transfer files.  Extra software is required on a Mac.  Stock Android does USB mass storage by default in my experience.  I am seriously disappointed, though I will probably end up keeping it, as I have promised it to someone for Christmas and I don't have time to do a swap.",
"I had ordered this because I had thought my Galaxy Tab 2 had died. It has since come back to life but that is cool cus now I have 2 tablets. I would give the Tab 3 a 5 star rating except for one annoying thing. Quite often when I am online on this tablet all of a sudden I won't be able to bring a site up, it says unavailable check your network connection and I look and it says I am connected. I have to shut the wifi off and then put it back on again so it will recognize that it is connected and then I can continue what I was doing. I can't understand why it does this but it is not that big of a deal overall it is a great tablet the same as the Tab 2 was. Actually the Tab 2 would do that internet connection thing once in a while too but not as often as the Tab 3. Overall I am very happy with this tablet.",
"I ordered this tablet the 5th of July and got it the 7th as promised (it was a Prime product). I however ordered the tablet in the gold-brown colour, but received it in the midnight black colour; I couldn't be bothered to return it. The features have been cool and have been as described thus far, however, I did note that when this tablet was compared amongst its larger versions (the 8.0 and the 10.1), the box that lists that it has the multi-window feature, was left blank. I'm not sure if that's true for every 7.0 model, but the one I received does indeed have the multi-window feature. Both cameras take pretty decent pictures. Only one little weird design with the tablet: the volume buttons do not operate in the manner you'd expect them to; to turn the volume up, you'll have to press the conventional 'down' side of the button and vice versa.
Overall, I'm pleased with the tablet and will be posting pictures if I can.",
"This tablet, I have used and tested thoroughly and found that it does have overall advantages. So as a techie, I tested this tablet out and below I will list what I have found to be the Pros and Cons of this tablet. *Also, I own the Tab 3 7.0 3G (T211)UNLOCKED PHONE/TABLET COMBO (in white and I purchased it recently on Amazon and it is just 96 dollars more than this WiFi only one). The 3G model is a real phone and has a Micro Sim card slot in it. For just about 90 dollars more, I got the phone part and the 3g data abilities in the Tab 3 with 3g (which is very much worth the added cost). The P211 I also purchased on Amazon and now I carry it everyday as a phone and mini tablet combo. So if you need a phone and tablet in one unit consider the Tab 3 7.0 3g as it is just one unit to carry for phone and tablet! Both my Tab 3 versions are peppy and run great!",
"Tablet tethers to my cell, and it is rocket fast on the web.  Overall?  For under 200 bucks delivered  to my door not bad!!  2 weeks into use...HUGE  problem...the headphone jack went silent...started making a clicking sound only...now no sound!!  A common problem with the product based on my research.  You can go to wireless headphones...but me personally...I like hard wire so...I guess more EMF for my brain.?

Positives:  No lag in key strokes, price is good... I like Samsung personally, graphics are clean, have'nt experienced pixilated screen with streaming video, size is perfect, SD card slot, more freedom than Apple products.  Again, you get your money's worth with Samsung.

Negatives:  I believe a common manufacturing error has occurred with the headphone jack, as it started right out of the box and progressed to clicking alternating with working fine to now no audio at all from headphone jack.  Camera is not up to par with most Samsung cell phones from the same generation.

I  will stay with the Samsung tablet due to freedom of controlling data etc...hopefully the next gen tab has a better camera megapixel like the S4...AND the headphone jack manufacture improves.",
This tablet is good. Almost perfect size. Good size screen but still can fit in some large pockets. The stock memory of 8gb can be filled quick because some games can be 1gb in size. But the memory can be expanded easily and not for too much. Performance is good. I am still surprised by the graphics of some games. I just wish I could get or find a gimp or photoshop like app to do graphic designs on the go without having to root or basically hack the tablet. The wifi range is good if you are within your home or the same building as the router but it can get weak when  you are outside. I am looking for a way to boost its signal by maybe using an usb wifi adapter for rasberrry pi like boards and use a usb to micro usb adapter to connect it to the tablet. Should work since rasberry pi uses android and linux like this can but this tablet has to be hacked to root it so you can install linux while it comes with android out of box. I would recommend and buy this tablet again. Battery is about 12 hours with wifi off but with wifi on it can be drained in about 6 hours if you surf the net alot and can be drained even quicker if playing a game with 3d graphics while wifi is on. But with all the usb power adapters on the market I doubt that will be much of a problem for most people. I have two wall power adapters and one car adapter while only spending about 40 us dollars so i can not complain too much about having enough power for my needs.,
"Received the tablet just the other day and being my first tablet, it took a slight amount of  break in time.
The size is just right for me and I am glad I did not buy anything larger as easy and light portability was part of my buying decision.  The color quality far exceeded my expectations.  Played a newscast from NBC and it was almost as good as watching my HD TV. It is a fast device with a logical interface that provides smooth connections to the internet.

I am impressed by how fast the start up and power off works..........literally a few seconds to connect or disconnect.  The keyboard is user friendly and if you purchase the optional 64gb micro sd card, you should plenty of storage space for smaller sized photos.  Apps are also downloaded with above average speed and work very well.

On the downside:

Strength of Wi-Fi signal is reduced sometimes but not really a big issue as it usually shows full waves but when it falters I lose only one of them........still a reliable connection, although my laptop and notebook are 100% in the same area which is about three rooms away from the router.  When the tab is in the same room (or next room) as router it performs 100%.

I know I can buy the screen protector (and I will), but fingerprints get piled up on the glossy screen quite fast.  So for now I wipe the screen with a good cleaning cloth designed for computer screens.

Lastly, I would rate the battery life as underperforming..........2-3 hours if high power is used.  Of course, you can adjust power in settings to save battery power.

Other than these minor shortcomings, I feel that you are getting an excellent valued product for $199.  Don't think you will be disappointed at all.",
"First of all, this is a decent tab.  I like it for what I use it for.  Value wise, it is a 'great success.'  I use it as my car navigation/radio device.  First thing I did was root it (XDA developers is AWESOME).  I left the stock rom on there, but needed root access for the Tasker app to be able to do all the things I wanted it to do.  I use an Akron dash holder to keep it mounted in my car.  When I power on the car, it boots Pandora, Waze, and other apps I want open while driving.  This thing spends 98% of it's time on my dash.  It does all these tasks admirably.  I have no idea how well it will do in the Utah summer heat though.  This is the WiFi model, I use WiFi hotspot from my phone for data while driving.

Pros:
- Bright screen with decent resolution
- Battery life is quite long (even though it is always plugged in while driving)
- It's Android rooted, so you can do whatever you want if you know what you are doing
- Audio is sufficiently loud (I normally have the headphones plugged in to my aux while driving but sound is good)

Cons:
- Doesn't do great in the cold, even though I can't expect that; if it's cold, prepare for cold warnings and no charging, sluggish LCD refresh.
- Menu/Back buttons don't light up on this 7"" model, sucks when night driving while trying to use it
- Camera might as well not even be there, it has terrible resolution and horrible color.  Don't plan on using it for any reason.

Overall, for a dash rider, it rocks.  Using Waze, Torque app for car data, Pandora or whatever music app you like, and Tasker seals the whole deal.  This app has a medium learning curve, but once you master it, you can make you phone do just about whatever you can imagine automatically.  8/10 would buy again.  Good for kids too at home with the WiFi.  If it breaks, oh well.  Not $500 bucks down the drain like an Ipad if it gets broken.  This thing has 200% more VALUE dollar for dollar over the Ipad.",
"Cant beat the price at $150. I bought this for my 8 year old son, instead of getting him a pricier and smaller iPod for xmas. I also bought a 64 gig card with it, so I can load it up with movies and games for him. (I have a program that downscales DVD's for mobile devices on my PC, so all the movies are free for us). I'll put some music on there for him also, all from my own collection. All sorts of free games he loves off of the Android Google Play marketplace. Plus, I can get him all sorts of childrens books that he'll have more fun reading on here than an actual real book. And lots of interactive books, which he loves. I totally recommend this tablet for kids. Just buy a decent case for it, and a screen protector, or take it to one of those cell phone accessory stores and have them put a screen protector on it.",
"I did a lot of research before choosing to buy a tablet to use as an e-reader, and chose this one because of its size, price, and the fact I've always been very happy with Samsung products. The expandable memory allows a MicroSD card to expand the memory from the default 8GB for significantly less than it would cost to buy an e-reader or tablet with those same internal specs. The height and width dimensions are roughly the same as a mass-market paperback and are perfect for carrying it around on a daily basis and fitting in my purse.

The Android OS lets me install all the apps I need for what I read. Along with several news and magazine apps, I use reading apps for Kindle, Nook, Aldiko, and Kobo, and I'm confident I'll be able to find whatever else I'll need in the future to consolidate all my e-books in one place. Each app operates independently, so I can download reading material directly from the internet to the app or device or update my libraries with what I purchase using a computer or other device. The Dropbox app makes a good middleman for getting free books from Project Gutenberg or documents from other sources to Aldiko.

The way the tablet is set up physically makes it perfect for e-reading. There is a button on the lower left which gives different options based on the app being used, and the back button on the lower right toggles you back from the book to the library. To use the Kindle and Nook apps as examples, once the apps are up and running, you would not know you were on an Android tablet and not on a dedicated Kindle or Nook device.

Of course, there are other perks to having a tablet, including being able to hook up to free wifi for internet browsing and email, games, Google maps, music, weather, other cool Android apps (which are very similar, if not identical, to iOS apps), widgets, and the front/back camera. The screen has the option for automatic brightness adjustment, so you're not always fiddling in the settings to make it comfortable to see.",
"I bought this for my daughter. It stopped working 6 weeks after delivery. Too late to return it. I will seek support from Samsung on how to fix the problems.

Update 3/2/14 I followed the directions on the Samsung site of things to try and get it working again. One was to plug it in for one hour and then hold the on button down for 5 seconds. It booted up and works great. My daughter had already tried this a couple of times and it did not work for her. For now, the problem is resolved and I am sending it back to her. I am changing from one star to three (not 5 as it did stop working).",
I've had this tablet for about 2 weeks now... and its like my sidekick.you know how we didnt have cell phones years ago now you have to turn around and go back home to get it cause you just have to have it.this tablet is with me like the pacifier is with a baby. whenever im ready to go I slip it in my purse grab the power cord and im off.love the wifi. so many businesses have free wifi from the eateries I frequent to my grocery store or the car repair spot. I go to town on this thing.i can read pdf excel powerpoint presentations you have a world of apps.i dont know where this thing can go wrong. Im very careful about what I download if I dont use it its deleted.i havent saved much just still seeing how much it can manage.i did say before I started saving pictures & books I would get a micro sd card. the storage is expandable to I believe 64 gb.i can say so far the camera quality is a little ify.it may be one of those where you need bright light and a close up. Will test that more. Using the internet is just as good as the portability. and just when you think it may stall (not that its slow at all just low expectations) you see the blue processing line going across the top of the screen like lightning. So far im very much enjoying the tablet.along with this purchase I bought the tech armor anti glare & anti fingerprint screen protector (love it). I recall the reviews being ify but it was a snap for me its a 3 pk comes with a smoother & wiping cloth. I also purchased a silicone skin cover to protect from scratches. I think i will get a case. Its another level of protection it was a life saver for my last tablet. I liked to open in close like a book. One thing I wanted to mention if your looking at your screen and it looks too dark dont worry it auto adjust to your lighting. If the room has low lighting the screen will automatically dim. turn the lighting brighter then the screen gets brighter.  Oh another thing that drove me nuts was wanting to organize or remove apps or delete one of the 3 home screens. To move the apps around hold drag and drop. if you want on another screen hold and drag to either side you'll see a blue line as if turning the page. It'll go to the next screen. To delete apps hold drag and drop to the trash bin. To adjust the home screens while viewing the home screen drag your fingers across screen as if pinching the screen. the screens will minimize and you can drag and drop to the trash bin,
"First the good, people put down the screen resolution being low, but samsung screens are one of the best , there 1024 by 600 resoution is so much better than other screen with same resolution . Side by side with my kindle fire hd i can barely notice much difference. The tab is not extreme fast but it is not slow either, if you install  a task killer or ram manger , you can keep the ram clear and it will improve your browsing experience. People say it take 3 secs more to open apps, really 3 secs if you cant wait an extra 3 secs, its time to slow down your life.
  I test the wifi and it works great the bars are not correct , when iam outside i get one bar but the tab work perfectly still loading pages and loading u-tube, test it yourself u will find even with 1 bar showing the connection is great.This is a perfect tab for movies and emails, the size is quite small and light fits almost perfectly in my pants pocket.
  Since the price drop you can find these as low as 149.00 , which is a great price for the tab. The tv remote is great for using the tab to control tv.
  Most people make fun or hate samsung touch wiz, but i love it , it has lots of useful features and mekes it easy to use the tablet, i have own the nexus 7 2013 and yes it is faster and smoother, but i like the samsung so much better, with the nexus you have to be very gental as it is very thin I was always afraid the screen would crack.
  Like i said if you install a ram manager or task killer and keep the memory clear , you will find the tab work fine, as long as your not expecting it to be blazing fast....
  Really the only real bad is the 8 gigs of strorage which is about 4.5 gigs useable .....",
"My husband complaint that he did not have a tablet... My kids have one each and I Have 2 (well, for anyone in the house to use).  But my husband wanted his own!  So, what a perfect gift for his birthday!  I have always liked Samsung products, and this one was just as I expected.  I added a memory card and loaded some movies and music; downloaded some games apps and others he may be interested and he is loving it.
The tablet is fast (in my opinion) and the screen is nice and clear.  The camera works well (even though he does not use it much). Mainly at this point he uses it for movies and music, browse web, play a few games and skype.  A very good buy and simple enough for the beginner user.",
"I'm not one to go to the top when rating anything, especially when I haven't had it long. But I like it better than a mere 4 stars. I'm still figuring out all the quirks. I wanted a tablet that I could carry when commuting by bike. WiFi only is fine; I have access to networks in most of the places I would want to use it. It saves paying for a data plan.

This little gadget is fast. The 7-inch screen seems quite generous, considering I would have settled for something even smaller. Now that I have it I'm glad I didn't. This one is the ideal size to fit the rack bags on either of the bikes I regularly use to commute. No complaints so far. I'll probably get a Bluetooth keyboard because it it hard to type on the virtual keyboard that comes up on screen. It's still surprisingly effective even with my fat fingers. I wouldn't want to blog a novel on it, but it will do for quick posts, email check-ins and spur of the moment searches.",
"I was looking at quite a few 10.1"" Android Tablets under the $250 mark but left a 7-8"" option open if I found a decent one . I couldn't pass up $149.00 shipped , using Prime . I have a Samsung Centura phone so I was easily familiar with the operating system and functions . Out of the box this tablet is awesome and does the things I want it to do . It's lightweight , battery life is pretty damn good around the 8/hr. mark depending on applications running and usage . It charges quickly like most Samsung products and comes with a nice Samsung-branded charger .

The only thing I wish it had , is the Multi-Window feature found in the Samsung Tab3 8"" and possibly the 5MP rear Camera of the 8"" , since this one is only 3MP . I think a fair competitor would be the ASUS Google Nexus 7"" which has a NVIDIA Tegra 3 quad-core processor and is priced in the same range . I am very happy and would definitely recommend this Tablet to first-time users and those wanting something smaller but very capable .",
"It's also not that fast.
I couldn't even fully charge without the adapter getting dangerously over heated. The good parts about this computer aren't enough to overcome these flaws and are pretty much standard.",
"Worked great for fist two weeks, then it wouldn't boot up.",
"Randomly locks up -- unresponsive, screen goes blank. Happens infrequently, but when it does my work since the last Save is lost and unrecoverable. Others report similar experience with Windows 11. I've downloaded and installed the latest Windows 11 update. Thought that would fix the problem but it bit me again. This is not something that can be very well demonstrated because it can go days without locking up. I don't have the time or the inclination to try all of the various remedies suggested online. (I did a memory scan, which did not cure the problem.) So I'm going to put it on the shelf and use an old machine. Maybe after a few months I'll download the latest updates and try it again. This is really insidious because it can go a long time before locking up and then the likelihood of losing a lot of work is greater. Probably it would be best to throw it in the trash and buy a Windows 10 machine while they're still available.",
"I picked this up to replace an older XPS-13 and even though this Inspiron 13 is a lower tier model it is noticeably more compact and higher performing in nearly every metric.Wifi, Startup, and Browser speeds are atleast twice as fast as my old XPS.Some small gripes are that it is not made of aluminum, has only 1 USB-A port, has no touch screen, and the hinge design does not allow much tilt angle.Overall at under $600 I am pretty happy with it and dont think I could bring myself to pay over $1000 for the XPS if I could do it again when this model packs so much more value per dollar.",
I like the 16:10 screen for everyday use and for CAD program that I use with woodworking hobby.,
Great computer for the price. Well built and great specs,
"I was hoping to capitalize on the CPU power for simple ethernet work.  Problem is that I have not been able to get this computer to work for longer than 40 minutes before getting a BSOD.  Have tried updating the OS and resetting the OS..  still the same problems.  And never the same error codes either.
In addition, when I try to update the computer to the latest OS feature, it crashes during install every single time.  Needless to say I haven't been able to use this computers potential at all.",
"Split it into 3, with the main drive C being just 150 gb. I didn't even realize that until I quickly ran out of room from uploading videos, forcing me to move videos to the partitioned drive to clear space. By then I would have had to reformat the hd to get the full benefit. Had one other issue. It died after a few weeks. Fortunately the tech support helped me and told me how to fix it. I had to tear it apart and remove the tiny battery type object and it worked again, and is still working 2 years later. Good little computer, but make sure they don't partition.",
"We need another one, it is good for our job",
"The computer never worked, SJ COMPUTERS LLC made me pay for the return to their shop to fix it, and they returned it not working again, it doesn't even turn on. Very bad customer service and bad product. Don't buy!",
"My first review was block for ""not following guidelines"".  To detailed I guess, So let me just say, it is not as advertised, wrong hard drive, wrong placement of OS, no hdmi, no wifi and bad packaging.",
"This has been an absolute nightmare to own.

It constantly freezes. I've reinstalled windows so many damn times.

You get what you pay for! I'm never buying HP anything ever again!!!!",
Absolutely quiet. Super fast.,
"very sound computer :))))
way faster than my 2013 iMac :0",
"most people don't recomend buying a used P C but I thought I would try, 4 months  and won't reboot,  only guaranteed 90 days",
Excellent product. Quiet and fast.,
"The PC case is scratched up, did not include a  WiFi Adapter or HDMI Adapter as promised, there is no COA sticker anywhere on the PC, and the included 2TB drive makes a loud grinding noise and has a manufacture date from 2010! I will be returning this PC.",
"Great performance, exactly as described",
"En perfecto estado, con los accesorios descritos en la compra, y funcionando perfectamente",
"Couldn't ask for a more capable machine for this price, and compactnesss.",
after a month of using this no problems works great,
I use mine for running vms on my homelab,
Very clean and ready to go.  No trouble setting it up. Quick Delivery and good pricing!,
"This is a solid computer, a great bargain. Seller replies to my question very quickly with satisfactory answer. Highly recommended.",
Just so so.,
didn't use tech support. Thickness is fine. Works as designed.,
Great PC. No issues whatsoever.  Thanks to the ssd and 16gb of ram it is very fast and quiet. An outstanding value imho.,
came well packed and looks new. Features were as stated - working well currently - would buy again from seller,
exactly as advertised and the one I got showed almost no wear on the case,
Received my shipment and they did not include the hdmi adapter.,
It’s one of the better desktop unit so I have purchased seems to be pretty fast and I’ve had no issues,
The product received met the stated description. The shipping seemed to take a long time but we received the item without damage.,
Computer was great until hard drive failed on day 4.,
Using this as a host for different VM environments. Installed virtual Machined for training on Microsoft & Cisco.,
Don’t forget to insert the wifi key and run the drive before trying to connect web as I did. Most satisfied with the tower and the deal. Best buy!,
Clean inside and out. Fresh OS install on SSD. Wifi dongle and displayport -> HDMI adapter.  I connected my 4K TV with no problems.,
CS adjusted the order and made it correct and followed up with communication. The unit works excellent and I would recommend  it to all.,
Very happy with this new computer which enabled me to have Windows 10.  Great - and speedy!,
"From my son's point of view,100% value.  I wish it was fully programed with Microsoft word, office and publishsure.",
"Item shipped with an 8 year old hard drive (older than the manufacture date of the computer (2014 computer with 2010 hard drive). Hard drive makes grinding noise when idle.  No DVD drive installed - not as described.

No DP/HDMI cable included as others have indicated. Depends on the seller.",
Computer is exactly as described.  The SSD is blazing fast and keeps up with whatever I throw at it.  Customer service was fantastic to deal with.  Highly recommended.,
"We have purchased several of this PCs from other vendors but MicroBee does not know what they are doing.  It says warranty for 1 year and number they provided (888) 305-3402 has been disconnected.  The operation system was installed, installed on the secondary drive (2TB drive) and the SSD drive was not even configured and the video ports were misaligned (mother board needed adjusting) terrible QAqc.  Buyers beware!!!!",
I have to order twice this item as the first one has arrived with broken parts and uncleaned. The second one arrived with misalignment of display ports at the back of the system. PC door quality is very cheap quality and also the power plug is very loose and it comes off frequently and shuts off the computer.,
"Bought it may 3rd, Set it up may 15th, drive died last night (June 10th).  Otherwise system has been doing well, fast for the things I use it for (web content, documents, audio editing).
Is quiet and according to coretemp it stays pretty cool even under load.

I have contacted the seller, will update the review when they respond.",
"No hdmi adapter as specified in the description.
This is a preliminary rate as I just opened and unpacked the product.  Will update in a few weeks.

Early update. It works fine. I removed all the junk programing it comes with and installed a few usable ones after it did all its updates. So I added a second star.",
"I needed a little more umph in my studio. This computer is great. Small size, big performance. Tech was excellent taking care of a small glitch.",
"This was very easy to set up, have had no problems that I've needed tech support on the computer.  Love that it doesn't have all those annoying apps that comes with new computers.",
"So far this PC has worked great for my home studio.  16GB ram easily handles multitrack recording with lots of VST's on each channel without lag or latency, which is exactly what I wanted!",
"Arrived quickly, not dirty inside, runs well. Thank you.The disk drive and wifi are external (usb) which turned out well because space is left inside for an additional SSD and video card. I like it (after two weeks.)",
"Seemed like a deal and I needed an i7 to run production in a small machine shop. This computer was also going to run some fiber laser programs but after opening and running the machine its be relegated to shipping. Claims to be i7, claims to have wifi built in, niether are true. Initial boot brought me right into windows with a preset user and programs already loaded... sketchy... After a thorough reformatting it seems to be okay speed-wise. Aesthetically there was some greasy looking spots on top (maybe paint) and some gross looking cat hair or fuzz stuck to the stickers residue that were removed. Buy from someone else...",
Just the way discryb the inside everything is new the ouside no scratch tech support fix all your needs will always buy from SUNSET MICRO,
"Great performing system, like new really like it. Great value.",
"This is a great computer for the price. I had a couple minor issues when I received it, but Moe in tech support helped me right away.",
"Purchased this computer for our Church. Added a low profe video card, abd runs our Easy Worship perfectly.",
I don' dislike anything. It takes up less space and has more up to date features than my old tower. I am still learning more about it as I use it and I suppose I will eventually have to update it.,
"This is a great buy, it's fast and quiet, my unit had some sticker residue on it and my display port to HDMI adapter was a little faulty, the seller replaced it without question and the residue cleaned off with a little alcohol",
"Everybody else seems to have great things to say. I wish my experience was the same. I received a computer that doesn't boot up with some damage to the back. Since then I have received NO help. NO conversation. Nothing. You would think with such an expensive item them would be ready to make the situation right. This will be the last time I purchase something expensive over the internet. If I had bought this from WalMart or Best Buy they would have made it right by now.

UPDATE:
Still no response from the seller so I had to return the computer. Now let's wait a week for them to get it and return my money. What a waste. Amazon was of no help either. Seriously consider purchasing your PC from a physical store.",
"Machine arrived without wifi and hdmi adapters. Microbee sent adapters within 2 weeks . I am delighted with the machine now. It looks new and is now complete. Excellent machine for the money. Recommended.

Jerry",
"This desktop is a great buy, it's fast and quiet.  The Microbee Customer Service was very helpful with replacing the DVD player with a DVD-RW for me.  Will use order their products and services again in the future.",
Computer is kind of slow but seems to be working as described.,
"We purchased 2 units for one of our clients and they love the computer.  Fast, reliable and just fun to use.  Internet run like a race car and never seems to want to stall.  With plenty of memory installed it makes multitasking a snap.",
"This is not a computer that you’re going to have for more that 5 months, I brought it less Than a year and it is not working, I contacted the manufacturer and they said that it is to old to fix it (10 years). Don’t waist your money",
"Had an issue with promised accessories mentioned in product description not being included with the PC. The description said PC came with wifi adaptor, Keyboard. Mouse, and HDMI adaptor. Only power cord was in bow with PC. Seller called me and made it right within minutes of posting my complaint.",
"I bought a new video card , and a SATA board to upgrade this.  I also put Windows 10 and Windows 98 on it.  It is very fast and a good value for the money.",
Everything about ordering this was scary for me but I can assure you it was the easiest thing I’ve ever done in the computer works fast and flawlessly! Thank you so much- you guys have done a great job refurbishing this tower!,
"Great desktop, fast with plenty of memory and storage, 256GB SSD with 2TB hard drive is a nice combination. Refurbish was well done, very clean, well packaged  No problems with setup of Win10 license and loading of software, no need for tech support.",
"The computer is as described. It works great. It did have a few scuff marks on the plastic ad the case was repainted, but it is refurbished. I wanted an i7 to be able to use zoom virtual backgrounds.  and this worked wonderfully.",
"I've had computers for 20 years now (have a small on line business).  This computer really had everything I wanted except the most important thing - it needed to work.  It came on for 2 seconds, off for 2, on for two, etc. etc. etc.  I checked everything thoroughly and it just wouldn't even come on.  It was boxed up and back at the UPS store within the hour.  My refund just came through after having been a week since I returned it, so that was good.  I wish I dared take a chance again, but I don't.",
Everything is good and functions perfectly. Only issue I faced is the HDMI port is not working as in I can't plug my cord into it. So I'm using VGA instead. I tried multiple times to try to fix it but it's not working probably from shipping.,
"I am happy that I purchased this HP Elite Desk computer.  At the beginning, there was a little difficulty setting up the disk drives, but Stallion Tek's tech support was friendly and helpful and walked me through the set-up in a seamless manner.  I would purchase this product again and recommend Stallion Tek for their friendly efficient service.",
"Not as described. No HDMI as listed in the description. After two attempts the seller made it right and besides the inconvenience I am satisfied.
I would give 5 stars but in reading other comments this isn't the first time the HDMI adapter issue has come up and they really should verify contents before shipping.",
"My PC arrived in pristine condition looking as new with all advertised compliments in place.  Windows 10 was installed and I was able to quickly customize features to my liking.  The SSD drive is fast and the HDD easily addressed as additional storage.  Overall, I am quite pleased with this purchase.",
"Must have come straight off the storage shelf to me. Needed 16 critical updates immediately. The wireless mini that come with it is virtually useless, slow and not much range -- looked it up and its value is 14 bucks so guess you get what you get. Also, the keyboard and mouse quality is less than a dollar store toy. Flimsy lightweight /thin plastic. Going direct to recycle bin. Once I connected my cisco wireless into it I was able to download the updates and begin accessing the internet. So far its doing fine. On a more positive note - The shipping box was very good and components very well protected with inflated casing.",
"I'll start by saying that I don't use this for gaming. I do use it for processing pictures on photoshop, surfing the internet, word processing, etc. For that it works terrifically. The i7 processor with the 16gb of ram works very fast. The fan is so silent that I had to open it up to verify that it was working.",
"Comes as advertised, had me spooked for a minute with the i5 processor sticker but had the i7 in it. 16gb of ram was ddr3 with 1333Mhz which isn't great but not bad for the price. Came as advertised booted right up and was easy to use. No issues with the fan. The proprietary power supply and motherboard will likely be an issue later on but at the moment this is great.",
I bought this so i could run Photoshop for a college class. I put a GT-730 graphics card in it and it is working perfect so far,
Things seemed to be going well for a week.  I then put my trust in storing data on the 2TB hard drive to free the solid state drive up for the operating system.  The drive crashed and would suddenly no longer boot.  I had to remove it from the PC and make the necessary changes in the bios.  So now I'm out of a storage device and more importantly the art/music data I had created.,
"I really appreciate the Bargain_r_us2 customer service. Even though I didn't keep this computer because it was noisy, they were swift at enabling that I do a quick return. Thank you!",
Not sure I can say anything more then my Title. This is a great little Computer for the money. The Processor is a couple of years old but between the 2 hard drives and memory you cannot go wrong for the price. I would definitely recommend to friends and family!,
"This computer is great so far for my business. Two things to note, it came with a different but better CPU (i7-4790) instead of the i7-4770 and I would have loved to have had an HDMI adapter in the box. I only use display port on high end gaming computers.",
Decent quality good cable management the only problem I have is the mouse and keyboard that came with the PC was broken but thank God I ordered a new set at the same time.,
"I initially received the wrong computer.  While it was frustrating, hear me out. I got the wrong computer at 3pm on a Thursday. I called Stalliontek. I had the right computer by 9am the next day. I am in Alabama, they are in Maryland. Let that sink in. The computer itself is fantastic with the usb 3.0 on the front and is super fast and extremely quiet. Looks brand new. Quality product. Quality product. Mine came with the wifi dongle and the hdmi adapter.",
"It handles heavy usage very well. I can run some pretty CPU, RAM and surprisingly GPU intensive games. It can run basically any application, I wouldn’t count on it for gaming use but I can run many games. All specifications are true. It’s very very quiet, I can keep it running all night without any issues even on high usage (which I wouldn’t recommend but it still works). The SSD is very nice, but the 2TB additional drive makes the PC amazing. For the price, it’s a truly amazing PC.",
"I bought many of theses HP refurbished units in the past years, it's really awesome for the price, super fast. Just be aware that given that it's refurbished there is a higher risk of the motherboard to suddenly die, when that happens you're out of luck, it has no warranty and you have to dump the computer, you could salvage the data from the hard-drive. It happened to me on 2 computers after using it about a year, while many are still going strong after many years.",
Its been a week and this machine has work perfectly for what I needed it for. I use this computer as a media server for Plex. This computer has improved my experience with transcoding outside my network. The only thing that was a negative was the the internal harddrive was not recognized so I had to get the hard drive recognized and everything was smooth.,
"I like the unit as a whole and the size is great. Speed is fast enough for my needs this far.
What I do not like......No HDMI adapter in the box at all. As other reviews have stated they left that out and it was crucial for my use with an HD TV as a monitor. Stalliontek told me they've fixed the issue but I am sure they told the last customer the same tale. So a Best buy trip and $20 additional dollars later I got her running the way I intended. Buyer beware if you need the HDMI adapter prepare for it to not be included.......",
This thing is great.  The internals were so clean you would have thought it was brand new.  I'm well-pleased with my purchase BUT...  a few surprises were no SD card reader.  That's a pretty odd thing for a modern computer to be missing.  The other thing is this computer is never going to win a beauty contest.  She has the heart of a champion but a face you'd rather forget.  The boxy and plain appearance isn't a big deal if you put it beneath your desk.  Tremendous bang for the buck!,
"I purchased this PC mainly as a Blue Iris security camera software server.  Works great, running five 4K and two 4MP cams 24/7 only using and average of 44% CPU and about 20% of the memory.  The i7-4770 processor has ""quick sync"" with its Intel integrated  HD4600 graphics.  Add the 16GB RAM, 2TB HDD, 240GB SSD, and Win 10 Pro makes this a great deal for around $300.  A new i7-4770 processor alone is about $200! (best price I could find at this time).",
"Works great so far.  The keyboard and mouse were wired, and not very high quality, but I didn't buy it for the keyboard and mouse.  Everything works well, and it's plenty fast enough for my wife and her small business.  If I had to pick a reason I didn't give it five stars, it's only because it was a little dinged up on the outside.  Other than that, great for the price!",
"I purchased this unit in mid Feb 2019. After setup all was good and unit was fine. In late June the solid state drive failed. On the description of the unit on the AMAZON site it clearly states there is a FULL year warranty on this unit. Now TekRefurbs AND Amazon are claiming there is only 90 days!! Amazon ""CLAIMS"" the full year warranty is a manufacturers warranty, of course we ALL know the manufacturer has absolutely NOTHING to do with a refurbed unit. I still contacted them as I was asked to do and they confirmed to me that their warranty had expired in 2017, (and had been 3 years long). Still nothing from TekRefurbs NOR Amazon and now to make a bad issue worse, I had purchased an extended warranty when I bought the computer but when I contacted them they also told me the site says it has a year warranty so they will not honor their warranty because it doesn't go effect until the origional one expires! For whatever reason Amazon has now cancelled and refunded the extended warranty I had purchased when I purchased the machine!! I had NEVER mentioned nor asked them to cancel that!! So now I have NO hope of ever getting this covered. Still all I get from TekRefurbs AND Amazon is that the full year warranty is ""manufacturer"" warranty! This is a PRIME example of the beginning of the decline of Amazon. I know as much of my few thousand dollars have already started being spent elsewhere.!!",
"I sent an email to the company about a software issue I resolved on my own, no problem.  I did not hear back from them, however.  I am wondering about that if I ever need tech support.

The key board is the cheapest of cheap, which I read about in the reviews and was prepared for.

The computer set up was easy and it is working great.  I am very satisfied with my purchase.",
"First PC was defective, but Stalliontek customer support responded and sent out a second PC that worked perfectly.  This unit is fast, quiet and with an updated Win10 OS is quite easy to use compared to older Windows operating systems. Upon receiving any reconditioned computer, make sure you check all the hardware ports for functionality and do the system updates before setting it up. Should give you years of safe and efficient usage.",
"This is actually a 600 G1, not an 800 G1. However, I still rank it top notch. It came already with a username and no password, hence I'm knocking a star off. If it had come ready to set up, it'd be 5 stars easy. When a PC is already setup, it takes so much longer to go back and figure out what they did and fix things the way you need them.",
"I've ordered numerous of these for clients. With the SSD, WiFi and 2nd HDD they are a great price for the value. Even the the I7 processors are 4th gen the performance is great when paired with the SSD drive. Don't expect them to be in perfect condition but I haven't had any of my clients complain.
These machines have room for additional drives if needed.",
"Bought this PC for a video surveillance application (Blue Iris), and it doesn't have any trouble keeping up with a dozen 5M pixel cameras. However, the holes that give access to the connectors on the back sheet metal, were misaligned in such a way that it was impossible to plug in the Ethernet or video cables. I had to remove the mother board and insert spacers to make them match up well enough to plug in. These makes me wonder about the thoroughness of the testing after it was refurbished.",
"This product arrived yesterday and has worked fine so far. The shipping box was undamaged and contained the computer, a keyboard, power cord and a wifi USB adapter. I checked the specs and it was as advertised. It did not come with the vga to hdmi connector (-1 star), which is no a problem because I am adding a low profile video card which has hdmi along with sound. The Windows 10 pro key provided worked just fine. All in all it is a fast, quiet computer and quite the bang for the buck. I would recommend to to a friend.",
"This is a refurb, so I expected it to be a little ""rough around the edges"".
The unit was a lot cleaner than I expected.

The motherboard had been seated a little high in the rear, making the ports essentially inaccessible.  A few turns of  a half-dozen torx screws later and it was as it should be.

A few parts were missing from the shipment, an the supplied keyboard was broken.  The vendor. MicroBee (ComSales)  fixed everything without any problem.  They answered the support line within a minute, and resolved all of my issues. The replacements/missing parts were fedexed to me so I had them within a couple of days of my original shipment arriving.

Very happy, and I would certainly do business with them again!  Nothing in this world is perfect, but we can make it better by doing better. MicroBee did better!",
"My unit arrived in very decent shape. Everything worked. Did not like the fact that the user, Owner, was already set up and the computer name was set up. I really want to reinstall everything from scratch but am concerned that I might have issues with the licensing key.

Two corrections on the stated config:
  #1 CPU in my unit is actually a Core i7-4790 (a slight improvement over the stated i7-4770).
  #2 Although the WiFi yin yang symbol is displayed next to the image of the computer on the web page, there was no wi-fi dongle in the box (a slight disappointment - you lost a star for that).",
"So I ordered the listed computer.  Read all the reviews and was hoping that I was not going to be one of the customers that did not receive the HDMI adapter.  Of course I did not receive it.  On top of that the computer once turned on and hooked up right made a loud noise over and over.  Given the fact it was late I waited till the next morning to try and install everything.  The next morning the computer was making an additional sound on top of the other clicks.  Once setup the Windows key did not work.  I restarted the computer and after I entered my password the screen would just go black and nothing would happen.  I called Amazon and they said they can only help with power problems.  With that we did a 3 way call to the manufacturer.  After having him look up the product he said that the warranty EXPIRED ON THIS IN 2014!  How is that even possible?  I literally just received the computer the day before, and on top of that I was shipped what I can only imagine is someone else return as the windows key was already taken.  Not sure if this is Amazons fault or the manufacturer.  I'm lead to believe it's Amazons as I would hope the manufacturer would not have computers that have expired warranties on their shelves.  I told them I would like to give them a second try and ship me one that has a NEW warranty and with the HDMI adapter, and the Amazon rep told me she could not guarantee that.  So basically my only option was to ship back for a refund.  BEWARE to all who buy this computer, even if it is working I would still call in and make sure your warranty is not EXPIRED! I have never left a negative review but I feel this was so bad I had to.",
"The packaging was secured and the PC was in great shape.  It does show wear and tear, but it's a refurbished PC and that's to be expected.  The price was right on for the specs and I didn't want to make a purchase for a new system because it's too much.  We had an older Dell PC that lasted us from 2009 and I gotta say, we got our money's worth.  As for this desktop, it started right up and it was a clean install, meaning I had to setup Windows 10 and it comes with a digital license, so as long as this hard drive doesn't tank, I can reinstall Windows 10 as many times as I want and it will be a legit copy.  Overall, I like this purchase.",
"I bought this particular PC in part because it had a large SSD, and WIFI capability. It was the WIFI that put it over the other PCs advertised as similar on Amazon.

Even though it came with virtually no instructions on what to do, I was able to eventually get the thing running and the important apps installed and working, such as email, etc.

But, now i have to find and acquire a WIFI access card or something. It's a disappointment. I'd be tempted to return it, but, dang it, I live 3,000 miles away from the US land mass in Belize. Returning items is no easy task.

Other than that, what can I say? It's a PC, it runs Windows 10 Pro. All the updates installed successfully, and it will work for me for a reasonable amount of money paid out for it. It just rankles me that a simple task, such as making sure the WIFI card (or whatever was supposed to have been included) actually got stuck in the box, couldn't be done right.",
"I purchased this to upgrade an I7 860 so I could have Win 10 PRO without having to build a new tower.
The 3rd gen 3770k and 16g of ram still scream even though it is and 8yr old processor.
Everything works fine except the 2TB storage drive was 10 YEARS OLD!! It was a WD Black drive.
I understand that they run tests on the hardware before they ship these out but a 10yr old hard drive??
These towers were brand new in 2014 so how does a 10yr old HDD get installed as a backup?
I buy WD Black drives for every PC I have because they come with 5yr warranties. I change them out after about 3-4yrs for safety.
Be prepared to replace the WiFi adapter with something better. They sent a little USB one that didn't work very well 2 rooms away from my WiFi 6 router. I just installed a Pci express wireless card also WiFi 6
Same for the keyboard and mouse.
Those 3 items are the cheapest stuff they could find.
I'm keeping the unit but I am tossing the old HDD because you're just asking for failure.
The SSD is also a brand I've never heard of but it appeared new. It was a ""Super Talent""??
This was for the wife to surf the internet, so no biggy if it's an off brand cause I'll just clone it to another SSD for backup.",
"I received the PC after a couple days of ordering it. Very quickly. When I opened the box I was amazed how well it was packaged. Could have dropped it off a two-story building that would not have hurt it.  The outside of the PC is in very good shape.
Open the cover inside was clean.  Powered on the PC. Windows 10 Pro was per installed waiting for me to do final setup and login.
 With windows installed on a SSD drive the system is very fast when logging in and out.

When I got the PC it should have included a Wi-Fi adapter and an HDMI adapter which were not included. Within a couple of hours after contacting the seller I was notified that they would be sent out.  Received both the next day.  I feel if you have a problem with your order the seller will take care of you. That means a lot to me.

 All in all, very happy with the order and the PC.",
"I've read several negative reviews. These mostly had to do with not working out of the box or no HDMI etc. Everyone must be aware that these machines are sold by different computer refurbishers... you need to check them out. I bought from StallionTek back in Jan `19  and have had no problems. Worked well out of the box and had HDMI, SSD, i7 CPU etc.  I see a number are sold by other hardware refurbishes. Do your homework and read the fine print and check out the reviews of the companies themselves. StallionTek had 96% positive reviews. I have not seen any recent reviews so perhaps they are no longer selling on Amazon... not sure. I see some, like the current seller, has a rating of 65% positive. That should tell you a lot.",
"This computer came very well packaged in one of those dedicated computer air cell packs that looks like a heavy duty pool flotation device folded over and heat sealed. The computer case had some minimal signs of prior use but nothing that would constitute what I would call ""wear"". Similarly inside the case was pretty clean although I could still see some dust and dirt buildup if I looked closely and shined a flashlight into the dark corners. It came with everything described in the listing, had open slots in the bus for a half height graphics card. No open memory slots so if you want to go up there you need to buy bigger sticks to replace the ones in there already.  The i7 processor is an older model that is capable but not very fast, not really anywhere near gaming capable as it sits.  I had to put in a graphics card in order to get a DVI output for our 27"" touch screen my son needs for his home schooling programs.  It is fast enough to stream the lectures he has to watch as well as handle the two-way meetings he uses for some of the classes, when I added a HD camera to the mix.  Plenty of USB plugs, some 2.0 and others 3.0 (I have not bothered to try to define which is which as we are not doing anything heavy enough to stress those systems.  It booted up fine and needed minimal oversight for setting stuff up.  We have had no problems in the first 3 months since we got it.
Although it was not purchased for my boy to do gaming, he did try and discovered a significantly faster frame rate but still not good enough transfer rate to run modern graphics intensive games at a speed that satisfies him, so he is back over on his other gaming consoles for that.
The operating system is set up on the solid state drive so it boots up in about half the time of one booting from a hard drive.  And having the big HDD for long term storage is a perfect match.
I am not sure if I would buy it again or not -- I would probably keep my eye out for a similar package but with a more recent and capable generation i7 processor and matching motherboard.  The small form-size is also a bit of a challenge if you plan on dropping a few cards into the bottom end of the bus as you have to make sure they are low profile and half height as there is some room but not a lot of room on the bus.",
"After reading the reviews and determining that I would either be fine, or not at all... I decided to take the 50/50 chance of receiving a decent tower.

Ordered from Stalliontek along with a 1030 low profile GPU from NewEgg with hopes of using this as my 4K capable living room media PC.
I first decided to plug it to a known, working monitor I pulled from my gaming PC set-up.  There was NO HDMI port as advertised, nor any HDMI adapter included.  Ok.. I read reviews of this happening but no worries as my monitor ALSO takes display port (which the tower had two of) and I was going to use the 1030 GPU's HDMI port when I eventually connected this to my living room TV anyway.

While hooking everything up, I smelled the familiar smell of fresh spray paint.  Upon further investigation, I saw fresh black spots on the case where someone spray painted it black.  Ok, no biggy.... as long as the tower works I'm ok with the touched up blemishes.

Whelp, after plugging everything in and using the display port from the MOBO to my known working monitor, there was no signal.  The PC turned on, but no boot, no bios splash screen nothing.  I started, restarted... plugged, unplugged... I tried it all.
Figured, well... maybe it's the display ports that are bad on the MOBO (I tried both of them).  Plugged in my brand spanking new 1030 GPU and used its HDMI port.
No luck with that as well. Still no boot, BIOS splash screen.. nadda

On top of the MAJOR problem of not booting, there was no HDMI adapter, the case was spray painted AND I was unable to find/locate the windows serial number that a few reviews said was attached to the tower.  Upon inspecting the entirety of the case, I also found a poorly removed/scraped previous OS and windows key label.

I build gaming PC's, but I took a chance on this one because I received $200 in Amazon gift cards recently which made this a decent buy for me for $199 out of pocket.
I will also add that I checked for any loose connections, memory etc that may have come loose in shipping, but came up empty handed.
This PC was just DOA.  Also worth noting to those interested, there is no additional room on the MOBO for another SATA connection.  There are 3 total... one for Disc reader, one for SSD boot drive and one for HDD storage drive.

Kudos to the seller for making the return easy at least. So thanks!",
"I received computer carefully packaged in bubble wrap. Unwrapped to find computer in great physical condition, few minor dents.
I opened case to add nvidia video card and found interior clean no dust bunnies, looked new.
I connected it up and checked BIOS version, it was 8 years old. No problem, went to HP website found the most current and downloaded and updated.
I found the OS was Win 10 educator pro, OK..? No problem, I blow away pre-installed OS's anyway. I reloaded Win 10 pro w/current ver 21H2.
I also noticed no COA attached to the computer but computer has digital license so no big deal.

The supplied USB key bluetooth/wi-fi adapter works great. Windows found and installed it immediately. I paired my headphones to it for a quick test, works fine.
I am using the keyboard & mouse supplied w/computer. I love the actuation force for the keys a little stiffer than other keyboards. I'm not impressed w/the mouse.

Computer used for replacement in den. Old Dell is acting up so I just replaced it, hardware problem maybe.

Computer arrived in doublelayer cardboard box, no shipping damage.
In the box:
- computer
- power cord
- keyboard/mouse set
- usb WiFi/bluetooth
- adapter, male display port to female HDMI

Overall impression good. Love the quicker processor! I would buy another.",
"This is easily the best technology purchase I have made in years.

I bought it to replace my ACER laptop which I bought six years ago. This laptop still works fine but I could see that it was struggling to handle multiple open browser windows.  I often have 12+ windows open across three browsers each.  My Acer is a core i5 4300m, 6GB RAM machine - which was admittedly fast in 2012.

Fast forward to this HP desktop. It's super-fast with its 240GB SSD which I think makes all the difference.  The set up with Win 10 Pro was so easy.  The machine is not pre-configured to your product key but instead to some generic key. When you unpack the box, the product key is clearly visible stuck on the back of the machine.  Just write it down and save it somewhere safe. When Win 10 comes up, try and customize it - like the screen or mouse.  It then prompts you for the product key.  And you're done.

When you set up your browsers, choose the option where they remember all your open windows.  The magic is when you restart the machine and click on your favorite browser.  All those browser windows display instantly, yes, instantly.  Opening a document or saving it is also instant.  The SSD is one of the best technology inventions ever.

This desktop practically makes no sound at all.  It's sitting on the floor of my home office.  Also, it freed up valuable space on my desk.  Previously, I had my laptop sitting next to my desk lamp.  Notice how much free space I now have.

The machine comes with sufficient numbers of USB ports that I put away the two dongle USB hubs for my laptop.  It also comes with a USB adapter for WiFi which is plug and play.  Also an adapter to convert your video port into HDMI.

All in all, I'm super impressed with the product.  Great value too, considering that new machines with this configuration cost hundreds more.",
"Just got it this today.  Popped the lid to look inside, everything is tight and in place.  No evidence of damage or whatever.  Fired it up and started my customizations.  So far everything is working fine.  The refurbisher did try to paint over some cosmetic scratches and that's fine but what I am interested in is the condition of the system and so far its fine. Its a couple of notches above my current system so looking for performance improvement with heavy lifting tasks.  Will come back later to update but so far this seems to be good value over a new system.

Update - 4/26/2019 - Have been using now for a few weeks and it seems to be running as expected.  My HP desktop that was failing was able to repair (CPU fan blade had splintered and it cleared) so I have two really good systems.  Since I am not a gamer, the limitation on the video adaptor doesn't concern me.  Since my old system is working again, I can phase in the installation of apps as time permits.  I have read the stories of some folks getting DOA units but mine was solid out of the box.  I am good.",

_____________________________________________________________________________________

It seems this Chromebook has a problem with a disappearing cursor.  You have to logout completely for the cursor to reappear. Horribly aggravating and I feel the 2018 Chromebook should not be sold for that very reason.  Do a Google search on Chromebook Cursor and you will find lengthy discussions on the issue for 11 inch Dell Chromebooks built in 2018.

UPDATE: After a long while, the disappearing cursor is not happening anymore.",
Got it for my granddaughter she said no problems ...,
"Love this notebook. Chromebook is a wonderful, simple operating system!",
this is my third chromebook. should have bought another ACER. Ths DEll is the slowest of all the and the ACER is over three years old.,
"I really like chromebook, but these so-called ""refurbished"" units need to be pulled from the shelf & thrown in the trash. I sent back the first one I received and had a replacement sent to me. Both of them had the same problem.... powers on long enough to go through the setup, then it just shuts down. No power, no lights, nada, nothing. I spent an hour on the phone with Amazon and Dell support who finally said it was ""bad hardware"" so they sent me another one. And....you guessed it, the 2nd one did the exact same thing. Another person I know said he's tried 3 of them and they all had the exact same problem. So, why is Amazon letting this junk continue to be sold just to have frustrated customers and product returns???",
Great laptop for all ages. I get annoyed when people say these are only for kids. I'm 30 and bought this for myself while I'm in school. All I do is browse the internet myself anyway. All my other media is on my Android phone. It's a great buy for us adults who are going back to school or just people who use the internet.,
No work.,
Not even close to the description.,
Compete waste of money. Had to return this as it was barely functional.,
Arrived in non working order,
Brand new laptop and 2 keys already broken and no way to contact seller,
My mousepad disappears. I have to restart the chromebook everytime for the mousepad to work again.,
Not at all happy with this chrome book. Doesn’t let me get past the first page to start it up. Would not recommend,
"I ordered and paid for a brand new chromebook.
This was not a new chromebook.  It is used with fingerprints all over the case and screen.
This was a completely bad purchase.",
Perfect as described,
Christmas gift,
Very good!,
Great for kids in school,
very easy to use and fast!,
Great value for brand.,
Space saver and provide all functions,
"Well worth it, great price.",
"The quality of this machine was not what I expected. At this point, it is a $300 brick. The keyboard stopped working and I was told that it would cost $125 to replace the parts. Paperweight would be a better investment.",
My grandson loves it!,
Exactly what it is advertised as.,
A gift for my nieces graduation. She loves it!,
I used this laptop for a gift,
"I chose this chrome book because it is advertised as coming with an ssd hard drive.  It does not, it has a eMMC hard drive.  I am charging it now and have not used it yet, so I have no idea how well it will perform, but I am greatly disappointed that once again Amazon has misrepresented a product",
My middle schooler loves it for his homework needs!,
This does what I wanted it to do....,
It was a gift; the person is very satisfied.,
"Came when it said it would, everything was exactly as specified.",
My son uses it for school and he loves it.,
My 11year old grand was beyond excited for her gift. Perfect!,
Love this notebook. It meets my needs and more. So glad I purchased it.,

Got it for 11th grader to do homework- works Perfect for that,
Great starter computer. Works great for my kids in elementary school,
"Excellent product. Unpacked it, plugged it in and it worked perfectly. Battery charged quickly.",
Battery doesn’t hold a charge .,
"My 14 year old son hasn’t broke it after dropping it 5 times, I highly recommend!",
"For the amount I paid, it wasn't worth it.  I am a college student: Word does not work right, most Apps don't work right.  I would not recommend buying it at all unless all you want to do is go on Facebook and read e-mails.",
"I thought this chrome book use for touch.
But it not.
It’s very disappointing",
"Feels a bit cheap, but this is a great, affordable tool for my kids online homeworks. Love chromebooks!!!!",
Bought two of these at Christmas for our teenage girls and they loved it!,
"This product was advertised as new. When I opened it, there were two user profiles already set up (see photo) and the language was set for a non-English language. When I called Amazon, they sent me to Dell. When I called Dell, they said the computer (which I purchased on 9/21/19) was originally purchased/set up in June.

I am returning this. I bought it for my kid. Kids can be rough on equipment, so I want to give him the benefit of starting with new equipment. Also, who knows what the prior owner did with it.",
This seller is a scumbag. Computer was freezing over and over while I was trying to set it up. I knew something wasn’t right. I wasted over TWO HOURS trying to get this thing setup. I call dell support and sure enough this laptop is NOT NEW.  It was purchased from Best Buy originally over 245 days ago. Even after a google “powerwash” whatever the $@&! lame excuse that is for a reset the laptop was STILL crashing. Screw you Happy Ranger/Oceanus. Buy new tech in a store where you can clearly see it’s new.,
"Love this monitor, got it as a second display for my work laptop. Love the extra screen space!",
This chromebook is a great purchase for my needs. The price was excellent and delivery was a breez.,
"purchase for grandson for school. exceeded all expectations. Chromebook is not designed for gaming, hence no rating entered for that category.",
it is to be used for business and we find it to be very user friendly and easy to manipulate,
Love this machine.  For the money can’t be beat. Not great hi def.  but really clear and a great product.,
household,
"I had a mac desktop for 8 years and it crashed. I had to get something  inexpensive fast, so I bought this one. I absolutely love it.",
Great product for school work!! I am a college student and wanted something small to take on the go! It is just what I was looking for.,
Not sure if it's her or the computer but was disappointed that she couldn't download any games.  But it's great for her college courses.,
"#2 key stopped working after five months of use. Not happy, getting a refund, not a replacement, not happy about that either.",
"I gave it to my grandson for Christmas, and he loves it.  He can replicate his school work at home, as this computer is similar to his classroom Chromebook.",
Purchased for educational purpose for children. Decent product. Does the job.,
11 year old son bought this with his own money and it is AWESOME. He researched and this was one of the best rated and its so affordable! Definitely would purchase again.,
"Didn't notice that it wasn't a touchscreen. Returned it.  Actually said in the details ""non touchscreen"" so when I searched for touchscreen Chromebook, it came up in the results.",

It's very nice I got it as a gift for someone.,
"I love that this is just like the one my granddaughter uses at school. This makes it easy for her to interface with school apps that are available for home use. This Chrome book is lightweight, yet sturdy enough for a ten-year-old. She is loving it.",
"Good buy. Got it for my wife, who needed a new computer for an online class but didn’t use a computer enough to warrant a PC. Works well, has good screen resolution, and a long battery life.",
"It started giving me problems after  a month of use, cursor freezing, the touchpad malfunctioning, I had to do hard reset several times and 'restore to factory setting"", and I might take them on the warranty as it is not working very well.",
"My son is using his for everything, he loves it. Great buy for the money you can't beat it.",
This computer does the basic functions as expected. The screen quality is not great but I purchased for my 10 year old and he is hapy with it. I would just be aware it isnt AMAZING by any means. But it is good for price :),
Bought this for my son (who is 8). It is exactly like the one they have at school. He loves it! It's a great chromebook and he loves logging into his class link account from home! Considering a second one for his younger sister.,
Sometimes it takes a second to boot up but other than that super awesome quality for price!,
"For a slow web browser it works fine, I enjoy it use, me and my son playing d&d with zoom app, video communication is good, it nice it auto updates and I keep it running to watch YouTube or write with google online , I enjoy the product",
"There is a reason this item is priced economically, they really skimped on the screen.  There is a mouse pad, but there is not a left or right click button.  Not a touch screen either.  This is a bare bones item.  Not sure why they call it ""Flagship""",
"After much research...I'm sooo glad I purchased this Dell chromebook for my 6th grade daughter!! Its the same one they use in her class and she can now research and work/catch up on her school apps, essays, slides etc. It's A.W.E.S.O.M.E. not only the price! ;) Highly recommend!",
"First, this is not a $1000 desktop computer.  What is it?  Everything I need!  I can browse the web all day long, I can watch Netflix or Hulu, i can video chat, it does everything I need from a computer.  I'm super happy and ended up buying a second one for the missus.  Battery lasts forever and i can put it in my backpack and take it anywhere.  Love it.",
Still getting to know how to use it.  Liking it so far. Good for business work,
"The chromebook arrived without a power cord for the charger. Vendor must not have a very good quality control program since this is basic to the operation of the chromebook. This also indicates that this is not a new unit since Dell would not have omitted the power cord.
Amazon support provided a credit to cover the cost for a replacement charger.",
"Despite being a 2018 model, it does what we wanted it to do, very well. Bought as a Christmas present for my wife, to browse the internet.. it works well, & much faster than her tablet, that it replaced , as it uses Windows.
She's been using it since Christmas day & has no complaints.. & is happy with it's performance",
"It was a good cheap computer, so good and cheap I went for one on amazon when the clearance section sold out at beat buy, I read the reviews about these being refurbished without advertising so, probably could have got refurbished for under $100.  Anyway slate was wiped pretty clean but just found that this new chromebook has been synced to some speaker I don’t own.  Fuxk these guys I’m gonna live with my cheap ass computer.  Good luck out there.???????",
I got this Chrome Book for my Daughter for Christmas and it would not turn on because 1. I did my Christmas shopping more then 30 days prior to Christmas and 2.  Dell is stating Amazon had this product since July so I do not even have the full warranty Dell says its Amazons problem not theirs  Amazon and Dell will not Replace the item. It has to be sent in to the factory which will take 2 weeks to repair.  Don't even waste your time and money with this product I do not recommend Dell Chrome book or Amazon for Computer purchase since. you do not receive full warranty time protection.,
"Most people do not fully understand what a Chromebook is or is not. If you know what to expect then this is a nice compact option. Mostly people who have problems with Chromebooks don't realize they are different from a Windows or a Mac. This is much more like a smart phone that looks like a laptop. A shrewd person will be able to do most anything they need to do on this platform. It's not for gamers or artists, or anyone who needs to use Windows/Apple OS. This is a perfect computer for 99% of what most people get a computer for.

You can use everything the internet has to offer and use Google docs to write and make presentations. Things save to your Google drive so you can get up them from any computer whenever you need them.

Future of laptops right here for under $200.",
Does everything as advertised and is pretty fast for not being a core processor. Great laptop and very light weight. Recommend 10/10,
Just  as expected...  Thank you,
Works great and cant beat the price. Certainly not a laptop quality but works great for watching youtube and watching the ships coming and going from the lake superior harbor cam!,
"I bought this chromebook because of its price and my needs. I feel like chrome books get a bad rep, because people always want more for less. I am a graduate student who needed a lightweight computer (its super light) because I am placed many different places. I primarily use the google drive function and just surf/use for streaming. It won't run complex games, nor do you have the ability to really use as many program functions like on a pc (you don't carve a turkey with a butter knife, so don't use a chromebook to run complex programs). It has AMAZING battery life! I used to have a $1100 notebook that was lucky to survive 2 hours, this lasts all day on a single charge, easily around 8 hours of use. You should know by now that you also need internet for everything except you can edit docs offline. If you want nice leisure computer to do some light work and streaming, I highly recommend it.",
Sometimes there can be micro flaws in refurbished laptop screens and you won't know until you close the lid and open it again to a hairline crack down the screen.,
"This is advertised as having the Mediatek MT6592 chipset. This was release a decade ago (2013), and despite being an octa-core it was didn't perform well for it's time either. Essentially newly packaged e-waste.",
"Very slow. Don't has dual band WIFI . Shows an icon of 4G with inserted SIM card , but internet too slow, impossible to use. The battery lasts about 1-1.5 hour . I recommend not to go near it.",
"Was not expecting much from a tablet costing $68 including tax, and running the outdated Android 10. Just wanted a workhorse tablet to read ebooks on.

However, there is no sim card / TF card slot, although the website description says: ""Card Slot: Dual Card Slot (Two sim cards and one TF card can be installed at the same time).""

On first boot, the tablet opened directly to the home screen with a desktop background of flying birds, not to the expected Android first-time set-up screen.

Settings > about tablet confirms 64 GB of on board storage, but could not find a way to confirm amount of RAM.

Battery runs down shockingly fast, even when the tablet is idle. Could not find a way to confirm battery size.

Extremely rapid battery drain and the lack of the promised external storage slot are dealbreakers for me.

When I tried to return this item, I discovered that I would be expected to pay for return shipping to China, so I am stuck with a ~$70 paperweight. Extremely disappointed.

Cannot recommend item or seller, unfortunately.

UPDATE:

Was on Alibaba and saw this tablet for around half the price I paid here. Scrolled through the photos and discovered that the top of this tablet, at the camera end, is removable and reveals...SIM CARD SLOTS! At a loss as to why this information was not included in the product manual that came with the tablet, nor in the product photos on Amazon, or, indeed, on the tablet itself. But, I am retracting part of the above review, and adding a star since the product is as described.

Battery life is still abysmal though, so can't recommend, unfortunately, unless you plan to keep it connected to its charger while using, which kind of defeats the purpose of a portable tablet.

But, SIM CARD SLOTS! *tiny high five*",
"Product screen was defective

I returned it as per amazon rules on 19th and it was received by them 2 days later

Amazon will not return my money  ,they say, until July 26. Buyer beware.",
Terrible laptop.  Gives me all sorts of problems.  I wish I spent my money on a better one.,
"Purchased two days ago, arrived yesterday, and so this review is NOT based on longevity (I'll come back in a month or two for that), but on features, build quality, and overall feel. Build quality out of the box is good. Body is aluminum and has a nice MacBook (I have an older Mac Air) feel to it. Not much flex when typing (I'm using it for this review), chiclet keys have a good feel to them, and not too cramped, which I like. Back-lit keys are a necessity for me (once you've had them, you never want one without) and this has silver keys with a white backlight. Very clean look. Screen looks great, full HD 1080p, which on a 15"" screen is perfect (4k just seems like overkill on a small screen). Boots FAST, shuts down fast, of course with a solid state hard drive (the future of all computers) no hard drive bottleneck. Fingerprint scanner (on right side near the ""-"" button works most of the time, but honestly, putting in a 4 digit pin is just about as fast. BIG touchpad, with great response. And finally, HP did it right with the Intel i5 and i7 (not Ryzen) models, room to expand. Yes, just pop the bottom cover off, and ""voila!"", you have a spare hard drive bay, and guess what, they installed a single 8GB stick of ram and left the other ram slot empty, so no ditching your existing ram to upgrade. Just purchase another 8GB stick of DDR4 laptop ram and pop it in, 16GB. One downside is the empty hard drive bay does not have the cable you need to go from hard drive to motherboard, and I'm still not sure where to get it. If you find one post below and let me know. Okay, that's it...with 18 months same as cash, this is a great laptop. Sell your old one on eBay! Hope this helps. :)",
I love,
Great laptop,
"It’s missing some of the features of the newer HP Envy models sold in stores like Best Buy, but it’s a little cheaper. It doesn’t have a camera kill switch or a adjustable keyboard light, and it has an anti-skid pad across the top front which is a bit unappealing. However, it’s a serviceable mid range laptop. Works in terms of not being trapped in Windows 10 S. It also has decent battery life (5ish hours of streaming on battery before dropping under 10%). Reliable, but not lightning fast. If you’re interested in gaming, it can run some older games just fine; Diablo 3 ran well at typical settings, Starcraft 2 ran, but was ugly.",
"Bought this laptop for my son, who is a college student and was interested in a touchscreen laptop. After 3 weeks, the touchscreen stopped working along with the touchpad, gyroscopic driver, and keyboard. After countless hours of talking to customer service from HP and even letting them have remote-access, they simply do not want to help. In addition, they kept telling me about the raving reviews they had for the laptop. Well, looks like I'm writing the first review. After this debacle, I wouldn't recommend this product or company to any of my fellow Amazon customers. Please consider purchasing a different laptop from a different company who will actually provide decent service.

PS: HP will refuse to help you unless you've purchased the laptop from HP, so this is in no means Amazon's fault. Amazon's hands are tied in this situation and HP simply sold me a faulty product and will not admit it or replace it in a timely manner.",
La mejor opción en allí in one,
product as described good value for the price,
Touchscreen works well. Keyboard can be click noisy and battery can last half a day because of Chrome browser eating up 50% of your CPU.,
So far so good!!!,
"everything is so perfect , I Bought it for my husband and he loves it ??",
"Very nice used laptop, works well.  The mouse pad sensitivity may be a little worn out it takes a firm touch but I bought a wireless mouse which is more comfortable to use anyways.  The touchscreen itself works very well.  I am enjoying the computer, I bought it mainly to use Photoshop and it has a great screen for digital art.  I liked the price for this quality of computer.",
"This was replacing a 5+ year old laptop for me so anything new was going to feel fast, but this laptop checks all the boxes for me. I don't do anything very taxing on it but it is very snappy for web browsing, word processing, and even some light photo editing. It is very thin and lightweight and has good battery life. Personally I don't find the 360 ""tablet"" mode very useful as it feels awkward to hold since the keyboard flips around the back of the screen but the mode works fine if you're into that. Only problem I've had with it was the fingerprint scanner stopped working after a forced update, but I was able to revert back to the previous fingerprint scanner driver and have no problems since.",
"I get this overpriced but, overall its a good laptop, but get the amd gpu version is just much better",

"I love my new laptop, extremely powerful, handles games with such ease and hardly any heat so far. I am very happy with it and definitely recommend this laptop. Only I would wait until you can get it for the proper price and not buy from these thieves on Amazon bc I paid about $500 more than it actually retails for.",

Everything perfect,
Perfect,
"The worst laptop I’ve ever had. The wifi card is useless as it never connects (I have to disable it and reenable it every time), won’t never pair other devices via Bluetooth, and it crashes randomly while playing games. Never again.

Update 2/1/2003: now something is wrong with the graphics card. The screen will randomly be all black lines on the bottom half. I've never had so many problems with a laptop.",

-Su rendimiento excelente.",
Ordered in to Cape Town. Took 7 days total and was a super smooth process. This is a work machine upgrade from a Dell G3. Very happy with my purchase and my work collogues I'm sure will go the same route when upgrading laptops.,
"First off, does NOT have 4x USB slots like they say, just 3x USB 3.1.  Second, the software for the lighting effects stop working and you're stuck with a rainbow effect keyboard as soon as you update.  Thirdly, which has nothing to do with the laptop other than it uses it, Windows 11 doesn't allow you to close the laptop lid and keep laptop functional unless you have an external mouse attached, so no auto updates of any kind unless you're laptop screen is on...nice job Windows on being counterproductive trying to be a ""power saver"".",
Video Player is loading.,
"The hardware in the laptop itself is as expected and great. The RTX 3060 In this is the Max-P higher wattage variety. Straight out of the box it benchmarks well, and will play games without much issue

*My main gripe with this was related to gaming. Admittedly I jumped into buying this a bit negligently. This model includes the 144hz 1080p LCD. It's not color accurate and it has a painstaking 25ms input delay!

Being sensitive to ghosting, I cannot keep this machine.

Just do your research before purchasing. The 165hz and 300hz models exhibit much better color accuracy AND 1ms input lag.

FINAL NOTE:
The backlight bleed is horrible on my particular machine. See my attached images.",
"Portátil optimizado para juegos, con la RTX 3070 sale la gran mayoría de juegos en alta calidad y rápido

Cuenta con excelente ventilación y no se sobre calentará (dependiendo el juego), la batería dura lo suficiente para una sesión de trabajo óptima

"This laptop sits on my desk and is gently used to be used for editing social media content. 4 months in and the keyboard started spamming the motherboard with ""A"" key intermittently. I'm a computer engineer and diagnosed the issue as a faulty keyboard chipset. Asus refused ANY sort of support for an issue that is clearly not the fault of the user. A laptop of this price tag that becomes unusable with its built in keyboard is surprising to say the least. Other aspects of this laptop are good so it's quite a shame that this is my first and will be my last Asus laptop.

Buy from another vendor that will actually back their products.",
"When gaming, I've had several times where the game crashed, saying it ran out of memory. Brand new computer, 16GB memory, and nothing running in the background. That's not right.

Zoom meetings and Slack huddles crash on screen share

I've lost wifi functionality twice where it decided to uninstall drivers randomly.

Should have bought a ps5 and a MacBook instead",
"Review is for Asus ROG Strix G513QM Ryzen 5900HX and RTX 3060. This is a great gaming laptop, if you buy on sale or under MSRP (1499usd). Ryzen 5900HX is top AMD CPU for laptop, good performance but a bit hot. RTX 3060 6GB 130W, powerfull enough to play 1080p most AAA games at good FPS. 3DMark Time Spy about 8927 with fan Turbo Mode. SSD is SK Hynix m2 nvme PCIe 3.0 x4 3597/2946Mbps. Panel is low range IPS-Level 144hz, good enough.
You can disable discrete GPU and use only iGPU to save battery (about 7-8h videos and web browsing).

CONS:
- Asus use low performance RAM Samsung DDR4 8GB 3200 1Rx16, same problem than Asus ROG Advance and Legion 5 pro (Jarrod's laptops review).",
"I love this laptop, but I've had a couple problems. There is only windows modern standby (S3) available for sleep modes  while plugged in and this thing is constantly turning on my display and fans at night. If it's not in your bedroom - probably not a problem. But it's bad enough for me to knock a star off.

Second - a few times for a few months after it arrived, it would hard lockup while sleeping. No input would wake it and I would have to shut it down with the power button. Don't know if it was some kind of bios or driver issue, but it seems to have gone away and haven't had to do that for quite some time now.

As for the pros - It's a beast of a machine with an RTX3070 and a ryzen processor which are kind of hard to find together. The screen is beautiful. The keyboard is functional but not particularly good or bad. Wifi and Bluetooth are similarly passable. RAM is kind of low on this model and you'll want to upgrade. Note that it contains two 8GB sticks, not a single 16GB so if you want 32GB you need two 16's. M2 socket to add a harddrive is easy to use, but the case is a little challenging to open. Make sure to watch an instruction video.",
"I bought the Strix in February of 2022, it's now October. Ten months in, and this laptop has been great, keeping up with my friends' desktop builds and outperforming many of them. I run Tarkov, Rust, Ready or Not, and very long games of Civ 6, Hearts of Iron 4, and Cities Skylines with no issue. This laptop performs very well, though it has increased in price considerably.",
"It is a gaming PC, so I won't complain about the processing power and ability to take heavy load. But there are countless issues with hardware. There is no webcam for a laptop that costs this much, and yet any external camera won't work reliably. Disconnects me automatically after a few minutes. I failed multiple interviews because of this. Now it seems like there is a problem with wifi as well. Everytime it sleeps, the connection loses, and I can not find any network unless I restart. Also, the performance is getting slow with every update. So I am not sure what to do with this overpriced junk",
"No me agradó mucho el decorativo rojo lo hace verse un poco informal.
 La pantalla se siente amplia, bastante buena y es mate.
En cuanto a la batería, si navegas solo por internet la bateria dura bastante (4 a 5 horas) y se mantiene frio. Ademas tiene un modo igpu que apaga la tarjeta grafica nvidia. En ese caso la bateria dura entre 6 a 8 horas. Si le pides gráficos la bateria se va rapido y se calienta, aunque todo dentro de lo esperado. El touchpad es agradable y la sensación al teclear es buena. Esta version no trae numberpad, asi que no esperen eso en esta version, yo me lleve una pequeña desilusion con eso, pense que todas las versiones lo traian. La pantalla se siente amplia y me gusto la disposicion del teclado. Me parece un buen equipo. Ojo que no tiene webcam por diseño y esta version no trae periféricos.",
"This is a great laptop.

Had another bombastic review written but some Karen seller probably negged it so here we go again.

Last computer was a dual xeon workstation. 64 cores and cpumark was only a few k higher but power consumption at idle was what this thing uses at max.

Equivalent performance. Serious energy savings.

Mines the coin with the right drivers and has almost paid for itself in idle production.

Wait for a fifteen hundo price point (this is prolly where Karen negged me cause sellers be tripping like pronoun peoples when you point out their mental illness). I Digress. This is a fantastic laptop for any sex, male or female will enjoy it immensely.

Whether it's my little pony or cyberpunk it'll run it maxed out 2k with full eye candy.

Make sure you check msrp and hold the line at fourteen ninety nine. Karen will love you.

I own both the 17"" and the 15"" models so I have options when I travel. Both are great. The big difference is an additional full size Sata in the 17"". Cheaper storage upgrades.

I upgraded to 64gb Sammy rammy. Runs it all. Werd.",
"I am a creative professional, who needed a laptop to edit, pictures, videos, make some motion design stuff and experiment with 3D stuff. Now I was coming from an all in one desktop set up called Lenovo 520, which limited me from trying many things, such as 3d but it was good enough for 1080p video editing.

However since I was always on the move with clients, I needed something portable, reliable and strong enough to handle almost everything I throw at it, I was looking at zephyrus g14,g15, legion 5 pro and many laptops in the same class but this one stuck out to me cuz it was giving the best processor available at the time, 5900HX, and the graphic card I wanted, RTX 3070.

Now even though I bought this laptop for professional creative work, this laptop is a gaming BEAST, it handles everything with so much ease, and does it really well. Almost all games are able to achieve higher than 100fps, which is insane, especially for someone like me who has played on consoles all his life, 30fps was usually the limit but theres so many possibilities with a gaming computer.

As for my creative work, it handles everything like a champ! even on battery and igpu turned on it performs extremely well and I see almost no issues, when working on photoshop, or editing my videos.

However not everything is perfect, while this laptop is great in almost all regards, I am often really worried about its longevity. I expect to use this machine for at least 5 years, my issue comes down to how the heat is handled or how toasty it actually gets. I don't mind too much fan noise cuz I have my headphones plugged in and its non existent to me, but while I game on performance mode, which is the default profile setting for cpu,gpu and the fans, I see temperatures around 80 or sometimes even 85 while playing Witcher 3, on high settings, I bring it down to medium settings and it almost makes no big difference, and sometimes even in my creator tasks which aren't very demanding, it again reaches around 70 degrees celcius. I have however found a solution to this, and use manual profile, which does get a bit loud but the temps are great. however I do worry about the fans and their lifespan cuz of it. you can always get a cooling pad and help yourself as well. i heard people get great results from that as well.

in conclusion, the best laptop I have tried, amazing performance, amazing size and fun to play on. worth it in my use case, only downside being the temperatures but you can work around the problem in various ways!",
"It's able to run two high graphics demand games at once while streaming, which I tested just to see what limits it might have. The only thing I feel should be pointed out is that after downloading the newest Nvidia drivers it will no longer be able to run in turbo without crashing. Be aware and stick to the Nvidia drivers that are compatible to avoid this. Version 466.11 is the latest compatible version.

The computer runs hot, but that's to be expected from a laptop trying to run the way it does. My advice is buy a cooling pad and never run it without it. Ventilate it properly -this is not a laptop to sit in your lap or on fabric. It will damage itself with the heat buildup if you don't properly care for it.

Overall I'm extremely pleased with it.",
"I didn't bought a gaming laptop in years because they were obnoxiously heavy and loud. I'm really surprised that a light laptop can pack more power than my old tower.

The pro :
*The performance is amazing. It's really an out of this world experience to have something that light that pack more power than a ps5, playing AAA games at max setting.
*Great value (well it's expensive but nowadays, finding a 3070 is not cheap either)
*Really great screen, smooth 300hz experience is amazing
*The sound is very good for a laptop, usually it's crap
*I really find the keyboard spaced out and confortable for my big old hands
*The Wifi is great
*Rgb is fun if you're into that

The con:
-A kind of ""gaming look"". As a professional, i would have preferred a more muted look but the zephyrus is hard to find those days.
-No webcam (but you get a finer bezel, for me it's worth it)",
"This computer is a beast. What I was really impressed with is how long you can use it on battery if you aren’t doing heavy gaming. You can set it to igpu mode which will let it last 8-9 hours on battery as long as you put it on silent mode. For streaming, browsing and doing documents it should last at least 6 hours.

I really wanted a 1440p screen but with this screen at 300hz it’s beautiful! I’m not a big fan of LCD but it’s a very high quality screen. Pictures don’t do it justice. If I want 4K I’ll just hook it up to a TV.

I like that it’s a very small 15’ laptop. It’s not chunky at all and it’s not over designed. I thought I would have heat issues with a 3070 but the laptop handles the heat very well. It’s not burning my legs when gaming.

I’ve had no problem playing all my games maxed out. A lot of the benchmarks I see for this use poorly optimized games so it’s not fair to this laptop.

The keyboard is nice. I didn’t want a mechanical keyboard because they get noisy. With LEDs off on everything it looks low profile. It’s really easy to turn the LEDs and to customize.

I really haven’t seen any bottlenecks for what I use it for. This laptop is the sweet spot. In my opinion this is better designed than the Zephyrus because the rear heat exhaust isn’t hitting the screen.

Only thing I would have liked to see is a numpad with the keyboard and an aluminum frame.",

"You will become a third party- not covered by ASUS. Buy Directly from ASUS.
 I bought this ASUS ROG Strix G17 in June 2022 through Computer Upgrade Express. Graphics card has died 8 months later after purchase. Dealing with ASUS warranty is painful and frustrating to say the least. I'm hoping ASUS will eventually allow me to send the laptop to them to either fix it or replace it.
 Update ASUS will not cover the 1 year warranty with a third party seller (Computer Upgrade Express and Amazon). Now I have a broken laptop and Computer Upgrade Express mentioned that they could repair it, but they are no longer responding to messaging. At this point I would NOT recommend buying anything for Computer Upgrade Express.",

"Being my first Mini Computer I was impressed with the size vs advertised specs.  To my surprise after hooking the machine up everything seemed to be in order and functioning.  UNTIL!!!

Literally days before the unit's 90days with me arrived, disaster.  Unit boots, black screen, BOIS.  Anytime and Every time.  Tried all the troubleshooting I could come across.  So as i gave up hope and contacted Amazon (still 2 days it it's 90th with me), who informed me they would not issue a replacement nor would they accept the unit as a return.  They instructed me to research the manufacture myself for contact info.  Way you go Amazon CS you really followed through here (Amazon CS did stay true to themselves - BECAUSE THEY TREAT ALL MY RECENT ISSUE LIKE THIS).  Long story make slightly shorter, after finally finding some link/email for manufacture but received no response  from them (1month to date).  The seller was very reluctant to offer their help it seems.  Partly due to there being no data recovery policy in place for this unit and or situations similar to mine. So far best offer to fix this is 1.)I pay for shipping to manufacture, and SUBMIT the bill to seller for reimbursement 2.)Some time after shipping unit to manufacture and submitting proof to seller, SELLER will send me a similar replacement unit as soon as they can. (NO TURN AROUND TIMES GIVEN FOR ANY OF THE 2 ABOVE ACTIONS OR FOLLOWING) 3. Instructed to remove the SSD from the defective unit and connect it to another machine somewhere to retrieve my info - Who ever thought of that procedure and implemented it in real life situations needs a vacation.

Nice Quality Product i am glad to have. A word on/to reviews/ers: If you don't know how to upgrade hardware,  use it like it was sold to you. i.e. Don't tear it up from inability, then give the company/seller a 1 star rating. Sure the sata cable connetions on most these minis are flimsy, like some excuses. If you want Tough: buy a case,powersupply, motherboard, cpu,ram, drives, All of good quality,, and build you one that doesn't flex here and there, and has real upgrade options.

It can get annoying trying to watch Netflix or YouTube and it constantly needs to be plugged in. While gaming you definitely need to plug in or your games will run half as slowly as they should be, it’s a feature to save battery but it makes the gameplay horrible. I can say this laptop replaced my gaming desktop and I’ve used it basically everyday for 2 years, and it’s still running smooth.

I would definitely recommend getting another stick of RAM for the laptop, there’s a free slot already so you just need to get either an 8gb or 4gb stick of laptop ram depending on what you already have, just match it up and your games will be running amazingly.

It can easily play GTA V, Fortnite, Warzone, basically anything you throw at it if you play with the graphic settings. I also recommend buying a gaming mouse because using the trackpad can be impossible for certain games.

The most annoying thing about the laptop is that all the ports. 3 USBs, Ethernet, charging, is all on the left side of the computer so using wired mice and headsets can get annoying, and you have to loop it behind. Just the one complaint i have over the years.",
"this thing crashes constantly. battery sucks. trackpad sucks. comes with bloatware. fan is noisy.

fast, and looks nice-- when it works...",
"This alluring beauty didnt run without its hiccups, had a few issues updating the drivers where it would hang and lag. However it was necessary to get the best out of it. Heres what i did

1) update to the latest amd drivers. Got amd link to track the cpu n gpu usage on my phone

2) getting an extra ddr4 ram to  give this bad boy enough juice

3) exploring the settings where they have different charging modes for either UPS, balanced or full charge. Which limits the charging to 60%/80% or full charge

4) applying thermal paste

5) undervolting this monster of a machine. I find that even undervolting by 100mV via amd overdrive was good enough to reduce the thermals on it, minimising thermal throttling",

"Do not buy this laptop, trust me.",
This item is defective I return to the seller.,
"Garbage build quality. Immediately upon opening, the plastic build quality began creaking. Destroying my confidence in my new $1000 laptop, the screen has started to come loose. Never ASUS anything.",
"RAM was corrupted when received, but after replacement it runs well. Laptop's do run hot and loud and this isn't the exception.",
"Muy buena, buen detalle en el plástico cepillado, y buena lapto",
This is my second laptop from Asus. I have had both about a week. both of them broke and started blue screening after about a week of use. I don't know what type of second hand hardware they put in this piece of crap but I repeat.  DO NOT BUY. it will break faster then any other laptop I have seen.  Also Really horrible customer support. DO NOT BUY,
"I was trying to play Doom Eternal and couldnt run the game at higher than 40fps on all low settings, while trying to update drivers and configure display i found out that the monitor is in deed not 120hrz but only 60hrz. seeming as how this was the only reason i got this computer in the first place it was a total wait of money. save your time and money and dont buy this product.",
"I've never in my entire life had so many blue screens in so little time. I tried to update every driver, made memory diagnosis several times, and to no avail. It would be such a nice product otherwise, but, given that I can't have this thing running for more than a couple hours (most of the time much less), it deserves nothing but my disapproval.
Btw, I'm using the FX505DT, which comes with Ryzen 7 and GTX 1650",
"I really wanted this computer to work. It’s a beautiful computer! But it’s just not good for even low level multitasking. At least a half a dozen times a month I received the “blue screen of death” - “Thread Stuck in Device Driver”. I even had it exchanged out, same thing. :-(",
"got it in prime sale with 100$ sale. just best laptop at this price point.
and gtx 1650 model also has RGB keyboard.",
bought this for my brother for his graduation gift. the ram is good. works efficiently. the battery life is so and so depending on how you use the laptop.,
everything is cherry after new bios update...,
"Small and powerful, It's handled everything I've thrown at it pretty well
except Netflix or streaming video / swapping windows.
I've spent days making sure every driver is up to date, installing / resetting
drivers yet this device blue screens about once every other hour.

Gaming would be great if you didn't have to reset your PC fully every hours,
however the SSD makes resetting the computer rather fast. The BSCOD error
code is either Fatal Hardware Error, or Threat Stuck Errors, which have been
constant since purchase no matter the updates. I often update this laptop just
to see if they have resolved the issue, however no evidence points there.

Great laptop, just wish I could use it. Brand new the battery lasts about 3-4x minute
episodes of shows before shutting down. It's got shiny RGB's on the keyboard as well .",
"I love this laptop. I'm still learning about some of the settings, because I haven't been able to take the time to read  everything about it.",
When it goes to sleep half the programs won't work properly. Battery life isn't that good.,
"Don’t be fooled by the specs, even though the screen is 120hz the laptop does not manage to get frame rates higher than 90, tried a few games already... highest FPS possible on league of legends is 90, same with cs:go
With that being said the 120hz screen is extremely useless.",
"For this new laptop, you have to know how to system works because its original system is not very stable.",
"I was excited to finally have a decent laptop with fantastic features and life like screen, but beneath the features this Asus FX-505DT laptop has major issues....despite long talks with Asus techs, and hours at home, this laptop fails to measure up.  All i wanted to do is use a USB device to run/install some programs and install a dual boot operating system,  despite hours to get the BIOS to respond, this laptop refuses to recognize ANY USB device, any USB device, thumb drive, external dvd player, any USB device.  Even with a purge of the BIOS, and complete reset of Windows 10, this machine refuses to recognize any USB device... A necessary feature in the bios , CSM fails to appear...unable to disable UEFI...and there's .more, which i wont bore you with.  I spoke to Asus techs who told me the USB devices should be recognized if windows 10 was installed and active.  This made no difference...enough.  To say the least, i am disappointed.  I have great respect for Asus brand products for desktop computers, but for this laptop, my first Asus laptop, two thumbs down.",
"Met my needs for a new gaming laptop perfectly. Pros:
• Solid, sturdy build
• Powerful- game performance exceeded my expectations, even with just 8 gig of RAM
• Keyboard is surprisingly comfortable to type with
• The laptop's monitor is high quality, and the high refresh rate makes watching live sports or gaming look great

Cons
• Fans do a great job keeping the system cool, but they can be loud
• The trackpad is poor, especially for someone that's used to Macs. Since this is billed as a gaming PC this is a minor issue- stick to using a mouse and you'll never notice

For the price I couldn't be happier with this laptop. If you're looking for an affordable gaming system you can't go wrong with this.",
"7 months after purchase, dead pixels on the screen. Surprising because I keep it clean, in a safe environment and don't abuse it . Seems you have to spend a minimum of $1500 in order to get a truly reliable laptop these days. This thing eats the built in an apparently non-upgradable battery. Good luck if you didn't pack the ac adapter when traveling with it. Pros: nice size, durable outer shell. Cons: dim backlit keys, loud fan, hard drive could be larger considering this is a gaming unit, battery life is absolutely abysmal. Laggy wifi and spotty Bluetooth.",
"I have had a few blue screens with this, but only when I'm taxing it- world of warcraft on high, six tabs of Firefox with Netflix running on the second monitor I hooked up to it. Installed extra ram, and haven't had a problem.

The selling point is the fans. I have a bird, and despite keeping things clean, I have lost a computer to the PERVASIVE dust that comes with a bird.

I open it up every two weeks to dust it with some canned air and every time, it's perfect. I put a white cloth by the wall near the fan exhaust and a week later, there's the dust that isn't in the laptop.

Amazing. It's not perfect and takes some tweaking of default settings to get the wireless stable but otherwise, a great laptop!",
"I bought this laptop specifically so I can play First-person shooter games at 120 fps and use that 120hz screen to my advantage. Unfortunately, the Ryzen 7 3850h alongside the GTX 1650 M is not enough to play games such as Fortnite at 120 fps. I had all my settings set to low except view distance and 3D resolution, and I was barely getting 80 fps, which would drop down to 50 during heated fights. During night time in-game, I would hardly see anything because of how dim the screen was.
Overall, the device is worth the price but might not be what you are looking for. I would suggest their A15 model equipped with the RTX 2060 and the Ryzen 7 4800h for First-Person Shooter games such as Fortnite, Apex, CS GO, etc.

To conclude, the Asus fx505 is a device that is worth its price but might not be for heavy gaming because of the low specs it has and its dim screen. For 300 dollars more, you can get the A15, which is more equipped for heaving gaming.

Oh, and the fans get loud during games, but it doesn't bother me.",
"I'm solid ASUS, my last one still works had for 8 years. Actually gave it to my daughter. I have all Samsung ram, hard drives upgrades.
I haven't had more blue screens of death. I have about $1,600 wrapped up in this damn thing. Problem is a Zeus don't kick out any driver upgrade software. And neither does Microsoft. For all this money I shouldn't have to pay out the nose for more software.
The problem is is AMD has software, Asus has software, Samsung, and every other little driver. Well they all put their little storage banks on the hard drives then adds up real fast.
I just need the driver's I don't need all this bloatware.
They are conflict in each other.
I've had probably 15 blue screen of death and it's never the same thing.
I've had to reload Windows 10 pro probably five times in the last month or so.
I don't know a Zeus has a software program that is a program but you must have the Microsoft app to go with it which I think Microsoft apps suck and is part of the combat compatibility issue. But as soon as I load them drivers my crap freezes.
I'm just really disappointed. I pretty much have a $1,600 brick. You must really know what you're doing to tolerate this poo. Make sure you have a thumb drive bootable. might as well put all your software on on another thumb drive too.
I bought this for a good motherboard and foundation upgradable for reason.
I last a Zeus notebook upgrades no problem.
I have wanted to throw this off the third story building, and smash it to pieces I'm not upset then I realize how much money I have into it.
Also noticed my wireless mouse 2.0( in 2.0 port) has issues bad wont work with 3.1 drives 3.0 ports (2.0 compatible) Mouse freaks out and wont work at all. But as im writing this I have two 2.0 thumbs in the same ports and works just fine.",
"I was very impressed by the item description and read a couple of reviews and quickly purchased the ASUS TUF (2019) Gaming Laptop, 15.6” 120Hz Full HD IPS-Type, AMD Ryzen 7 3750H, GeForce GTX 1650, 8GB DDR4, 512GB PCIe SSD version.  While waiting for UPS to deliver the laptop, as it needed a signature, I started reading all the reviews. I quickly became very concerned with the reviews detailing the BSOD's and black screens. I then googled video reviews, and found that almost all reviewers by professional techs recommended this laptop as a beginner's gaming machine.

I have now used the laptop for approximately 12 hours and have these observations. First the negative. I HATE that all USB slots are on the left side of the laptop. There is nothing on the right side. I spend a lot of time gaming and laying down with the laptop on my belly and I have my left hand resting on the left side as I constantly use the Function 1-4 keys. The USB plug in adapter is rubbing a blister on my hand as there is no way to avoid it unless I don't use a mouse, which is unacceptable. The arrow keys are a little to far towards the middle, so I had to program the number pad keys for moving in game. Also, the F1 key starts too far to the right, so I have had to program my gaming keys somewhat.

With that said, the laptop runs smoothly, is very quiet and does not run hot at all. Now I only play Everquest which is not a demanding game for a PC, but there is no heat or noise from the fans. I like the keyboard other than what I described above, and have no idea why some people have complained about the keyboard and touch pad. The lighted keyboard does change colors, but it isn't a distraction for me at all, so I haven't tried to change it to stay at one color as of yet.

So I like this laptop. If I experience any issues I will update my review.",
I use this product most of the time for games. it gives a great refresh rate and no lag while playing game set all high on apex legends,
"Do yourself a favor and buy one more stick of ram. This machine is a beast. The fact that I can play Cities skylines AND No man's sky without a drop im framerate speaks for itself.
If you are having problems update your drivers and download C++ all the way back to 2008. Works like a charm. Best bang for my buck ever.",
"I had high hopes about this laptop, as I saw that it was well rated and ASUS is a dependable brand. However, within three months, the hard drive failed completely with without warning from the SMART system, and I lost everything on it. At that point, I reached out to Snow Bell for a refund for the cost of the hard drive, which they quickly got back to me about and everything was great.

Since then, I've just had a world of problems with this laptop. The system device and display drivers kept failing, making my HDMI port unusable. Several of my keys are discolored or partially burnt out. The function allowing me to change my fan speed didn't work any longer than the first day I used it. The track pad, as some other users have complained about, is slow to respond and often rebellious against what you actually want it to do. The screen flickers like a candle when the brightness is anything but 100% when it's running on battery, and the fan on the left side rattles loudly if the laptop is anything but perfectly level.

Of course, I reached out to Snow Bell again, but where their customer service got back to me in a matter of hours before, it's been days and they seem to be nowhere to be found. Even Amazon failed to connect me to their customer service call center. Maybe I just got a dud, but I'm thanking my past self for purchasing a warranty, as that seems to be my only option for this lemon now.",
My husband loves his laptop he doesn’t play hardcore games that require crazy amounts of graphics so this laptop runs every game he plays smoothly and also browsing the web and watching videos is so fast. The SSD on this laptop is very fast the computer turns on super fast.,
My wife uses this for her real estate instead of gaming but the Chroma RGB keyboard and the extreme graphics make it fun and easy to view photos for her clients.  My son can't wait to inherit it so he can play high quality games as well.  Full recommendation on this great laptop.,
"When i first got the laptop it was fast. I had issues with the operating system, apparently I received a corrupt OS. After reinstalling windows which is no problem at all fast and easy process I'm back to normal. Overall a very fast laptop.
Gaming: I can run Metro Exodus on high settings WOW no problem. Honestly, there is really not a game that you cant play on high settings and get a decent frame rate plus the screen makes the games look AWSOME. Also the fans get loud to keep the beast cool, but who cares if your buying this for gaming your going to have either headphones or a headset so that doesnt really matter to me.
BUT do yourself a favor and get another stick of RAM to unlock the potential of this computer, because the laptop is gimped by that one stick of DDR4.
General Use: I mean it has a sdd lets be honest its quick in doing anything browsing the web and those sorts of things.
OVERALL: Would i buy again? Yes i believe if you have any sorts of knowledge about computers your going to buy this and be able to fix any problems you come across. Its a powerful computer that's portable for gamer's. I'm extremely satisfied with this computer. Only thing i might upgrade now is another ssd in the computer for more storage.",
"I was looking for a budget laptop for both blogging & gaming & the ASUS TUF (2019) Gaming Laptop is perfect for my needs. It runs the games I play regularly, WoW & The Sims 4 on ultra settings without issues. However, I do recommend an external hard drive or upgrading the hard drive. I opted for a 2 TB external HD as WoW & The Sims 4 with all expansions are pretty large.
Battery life seems decent as I was once playing WoW & didn't realize that my laptop wasn't fully plugged in for quite & while & was still at 80%.
This isn't going to play Cyberpunk or brand new games on ultra-high settings, but for a laptop that is under $1k, it is a decent gaming laptop.",
"Laptop has a bright, high definition screen and great refresh rate. It's good for gaming especially FPS and watching videos. The laptop speakers are okay, sounds are definitely better with headsets. I use this for school and casual gaming.",
Amazing Computer for a great price! Exactly what I needed for school!,
"We bought the computer for my daughter as a starter laptop. It did not work, came with no power cord, and there were fingerprints all over the touchscreen. It was apparently a Best Buy product. It was supposed to be new. It does not look new at all.  It was very disappointing. Will not be buying another laptop from Amazon.",
"I purchased this laptop about 3 months ago.  I really love it.  It is fast, nice keyboard and screen.  Perfect for searing the web and games.  I would recommend it,",
I just love it I have a bigger laptop but my smaller Chromebook is so much easier to use.,
Love the touch screen,
"I bought 5 phones, 3 are working fine and 2 are damaged. The issue appeared after a while of use.  in short the issue is best explained below:
The phones once configured works for a day or less  and then stops working, no call incoming or out going, the configuration has to be redone to use it again.
 The directory does not show the extension number & the name, instead it shows the email ID's.  We need extension number & name to appear on screen",
"Excellent corporate grade video phone devices and high quality as you’d expect.

They are intended to be registered to your CUCM environment.",
works great,
"I did not open it. The tablet itself is 9.7. The screen is smaller than my 8"" tablet.",
I didn’t think it is right that just 10 days after the it is not covered I would never recommend this tablet to anyone,
nice item for a good price,
This has become the most used computer for web purposes in the house.  Asus doesn't ship their computers with preinstalled trash on them.,
"Screen Quality is good, battery life is fair.  The touch screen is very frustrating, it picks up on half of what I type or touch.  This review has taken me about 5 minutes to type.",
"this is the biggest RIP OFF I have ever experienced. With the battery freshly charged and turned off over night and the battery completely died. You people are incorrigible. I will NEVER  buy anything from Amazon again. FORSHAME FORSHAME, YOU SUCK",
"Exactly what I expect! I love asus products especially their Zenpad tablets, they are truly amazing with the gadgets they make!",
"I needed my own laptop. So I decided to buy this one because it looks really nice, and because it works great.",
"It came with an audio issue, it sounds like interference, it's been hard to get warranty or return it because I livr out of USA",
"This product works fine EXCEPT for the sizing/partitioning of the hard drive. The product description indicates a 192gb hard drive, which is does have, however, it was received with the drive already partitioned into a c: drive of 62gb and a d: drive of 128gb. It would be expected that the drive, if partitioned at the factory, would have a much smaller d: drive loaded with recovery data for consumer to use in the event of an issue sometime down the road; giving the consumer the option to partition the drive to his/her particular desires. Though that issue can be corrected by the consumer, it is disappointing that the option is not readily available to less-experienced users.
UPDATE: Purchased in June 2022. Trusted Amazon and HP - my mistake. This product is a toy compared to a real computer. I am disappointed in its performance but even more disappointed in the inability to upgrade the unit to make it more in-line with what I use a computer for - had no idea it could not be tweaked to improve the internal storage and memory. Basically piece of garbage - will rework my Toshiba laptop even though it is older technology and will not accept Windows 11 but that is a secondary issue - at least it is a better overall machine!!!!!!",
"Computer came with Windows 10 Home, NOT Pro as listed. Computer froze immediately on startup and gives errors. Less than a day and it's a mess, I wrote the seller and will update if they can resolve this blatant rip-off.",
"cant get online. Says i have to first register windows, but when i try, it says it cant register my version of windows (which is listed as windows 10 and has what appears to be a valid product key), and i have to first visit ""the store"" and purchase A GENUINE VERSION OF WINDOWS. . .So i guess that means this computer came with a fake version of windows that allows you to turn it on and set it up, but wont actually allow you to use the computer and go online or anything. I cant even use Word because it too has to be registered online, which requires that i first register windows, but again, i cant. Already loaded too many personal files on it to be comfortable returning it, so i guess what i bought is a really really expensive external hard drive to store my media on, because that is the only thing it will allow me to do.

I stopped buying Dell over a decade ago because their quality went way down and their stuff just wasnt worth anything to me anymore. I decided to give it a shot again cause i just needed something small and inexpensive to use mainly for writing. I wasnts expecting anything great, but I never dreamed that their quality would be so severely lacking now that i wouldnt even be able to use Word or get online to download another word processor!  Ill never buy a Dell ever again.",
"Every resource this device has is working overtime just to start all the bloatware that is Windows 10. That and all the crap loaded by Dell stretch this device beyond its limits. Turn it on, go and get a cup of something and hopefully by the time you come back it will be useable. Also; the power button for this device is in the most inconvenient position possible. The touch function is sub par and if you forget to deactivate the keys, you'll be wrestling with it for hours.",
"got this today from dell on black friday. I am surprise how fast it is even it comes with a HDD, and I upgraded to SSD, it turn on and off in few seconds, cant complaint for $299,LOL.  However, keep in mind that i dont see a RAM slot, may be the RAM is built in and can not be replace.

I have to say the built quality just so so, I also own inspiron 15 7000 and the built quality is much much better. I am not too crazy about the touch pad as well, so I use a wirless mouse instead.

the resolution is the biggest drawback for me, my eyes hurt after i work on my project for half hour. God, i get spoiled by the 1920x1080.

overall it is good buy at this price. HTH",
"I got 3 of these during the black friday sale on dell.com and they have all had problems!  I never write a reveiw and am only on here because I've wasted so much time with this product.  I'm sorry guys because I buy a lot of good products and I rely on customer reviews and always want to leave one but am never motivated enough till I've lots so much time and money.

One of the three was DOA and was sent back for a refund because the other two seemed to have Chinese malware installed and I manually removed but didn't want to do it for a third one (all gifts) after that.

Of the two remaining, one is rarely used because the person said its too slow!  You will click a button and then watch it click on the system a second later and then start a really slow load.  The person using it is young and so hasn't used it much or complained but I know its just junk.

The third one that has been used for school is broke after 7 months of causal use.  The F1 key popped out 1st.  The left hinge stopped working a month ago.  Now the ""reduce volume seems to be stuck but if you press it, it responds so it must be a software issue but it's volume down icon on the screen is stuck and keeps trying to go lower.  We have tried to do a factory reinstall but it's still stuck.  Dell wants $219 to fix the F1 key and hinge and can't say if the volume down software issue can be fixed.  I paid $299 for these devices on black friday and have lost hundreds more in time trying to clean them up and maintain them out of guilt for the recipients.

This is just a truly sad product and I hope it just all came from a bad batch for Dell and their customers sake.",
Is everything that I expected.,
Great computer. Using it to write this review,
keyboard is unresponsive.,
The computer is great. It came right on time.,
got 11 insted of 11.6 with no backlight,
"this was for our granddaughter, small and light, just right for her. She's 10.",
Okay laptop but I am now on my second one that just died.  Won't turn on.,
"SO SLOW!!!  Because it is so slow, I rarely use it. A total waste of money!!",
It has broken three times. The power plug in site pops and crackles. Cannot charge. POS!! Customer support was awful. I’m very disappointed.,
Received on time. Very good laptop.,
I love my new computer. I am getting use to the apps on it. Would highly recommend it.,
"Even for a kid computer, this machine is so slow making it almost unusable. Just doing basic functions is almost impossible.  Save your money. Should have sent it back.",
absolutely love it!  wanted a smaller one than my current one so the keyboard is a bit of an adjustment but this is to be expected.,
"Love it, still learning on it.",
Lightweight and ideal for its intended purpose.,
"The computer is not fast, frequently seizes up, and is not user friendly.",
"Good
It is small and portable.
Processing speed is slow.",
"I ordered a new computer and it came with scratches. Within the first 4 months of normal use, it started crashing. Now I have already reset it twice and works terribly. The rotation is locked and won't unlock. The battery lasts very little. extremy disappointed. Wasted my money in something that's not useful.",
"Love my new laptop.  Works as expected for the price range.  Has plenty of storage, and adequate memory.  The portability and the fact that I can use it as a tablet is a plus.  Good battery life.",
This is by far the slowest lap top I have ever used. It is stressful how slow it is and all I use is Microsoft Office and the internet. Looking to see if Dell will allow a trade in. This computer is terrible.,
Never had do many issues with a computer,
the touch tablet doesn't work when i flip the computer to the tablet mode.,
The microphone does not work but I found out after a couple of months when I flew for the first time after getting this laptop.,
Worked great for a year and and 2 months and then screen and the keyboard would only work intermittently.,
This is a pretty good computer. The sound is ok and the picture is good. For the price its a good little computer. Only 2 issues is the power button is at a bad spot and the battery life is short. Other than that not bad.,
"Bought this for my mom. She wanted something light weight and she liked the color. This piece of garbage isn't worth a $100. I didn't expect it to be a fast computer but slow isn't the right word for it. Sometimes it just stops. When it gets like that you may as well set it on the table and leave it until it finally starts doing something several minutes later. I'm talking about basic tasks like opening a web browser or even logging on from startup. It would just get stuck. We kept it up to date and ran virus scans regularly. She only used it to check facebook, email and basic web browsing. It should have never been released, especially for $500. If it's trying to do a windows update you can't do anything else with it until the update is complete because it doesn't have the processing power to do more than one thing at a time. A $500 computer should be able to easily handle basic tasks. We will probably wipe it and give it to a thrift store. I wouldn't give it to anyone I know. I'm definitely disapointed to know Dell would sell something like this. Maybe we got a bad one but I have seen enough bad reviews to know ours isn't the only bad one.",
This laptop is a nightmare. Never worked right from the start. I've tried everything and now that I'm fed up and want to return it I realized I'm a couple days past the return window so I'm stuck with it. All I wanted to do was use Word to take notes in class and print readings for school. It can't even handle that without freezing. I just spent 15 minutes trying to print a PDF before giving up. Do not buy this.,
"Scored 723 on the novabench benchmark - which is enough for my application.  It is priced very competitively.  The only drawback is the location of the power on/off button.  It is located on the right side of the computer near the front.  If I reposition the computer with both hands, it is quite easy to touch the power button - which is pretty darn senstivie to the touch.  The computer will go to sleep when this happens, and I have to ""touch"" it again to wake it up.",
"Love it.  Fast, 500GB HDD and really fun and cute.  So easy to travel with or just around the house.

Wireless is fast and so is the processor.  Dell is easy to work with and Amazon delivered it.

Replaced a very expensive Sony Vaio but don't even remember it as this little Dell is so much fun without paying for the things I never really needed on the Sony.",
"I've had this thing for about a year and a half now and it's probably the most mediocre computer I've ever owned.  The hardware can seemingly just barely keep up with even the OS, so oftentimes getting it fired up can take awhile.  Add-ons from Dell like Support Assist, which seemingly does nothing useful by the way, slow down the computer even more. When it decides it wants to work, it generally works fine, but getting to that point seems to take some effort.  All I use it for is browsing the internet and it can't even keep up with that.  What you pay for here is the touchscreen and not the computer.  I just know I've said, ""D****it I hate this computer!"" more times in the last year and a half than I ever did with computers I owned in the past.",
"I purchased this device as a replacement for my Dell Inspiron 11 3147. My older device was having issues with the touchscreen (as well as other hardware issues) and was no longer under warranty so I decided to find a replacement. After a LOT of research into other brands, Dell was the only brand I could find with an 11.6"" screen that had a decent processor, so I bought a newer version of my older model.

The Bali Blue is really nice. The color has more purple in it than the pictures would lead you to believe, which was a little bit of a let down, but still looks great. However, the case is very cheap plastic, think those old lunch boxes from the 90s, it feels a lot like that. This is a definite downgrade from the 3147 model, which had a sturdy metal casing. The screen also seems to be of lower quality than the 3147 had. Even looking at it straight on, you will notice that the bottom of the screen is brighter than the top. If you pull up an all black image (like the Dell boot screen) you'll notice that the top is black (as it should be), while the bottom is a bright gray, approaching white). This is not usually an issue when using in laptop mode. However, if you switch it to tablet mode and rotate into portrait mode to say, read a book,whichever side was bottom in laptop mode is noticeably brighter than the other. It makes the text appear to become boldened as you read. Also, if the book you are reading does not take up the whole screen, you will have black bands at the top and bottom, which is normal. But, with the brightness issue, if you move the tablet even a little while you read, the brightness seems to flicker and can be really distracting. (To note: it does not actually flicker, it just appears to due to the screen not appearing the same from all angles).

First and second boot ups were really slow when compared to my older model, but it seems to be doing better now. (Probably had to do with background apps downloading updates, etc.)

The keyboard is firm and responsive and feels like an improvement over the older 3147 model. Time and use will determine if this is the case.

You cannot upgrade the RAM in this unit as it is soldered to the motherboard unlike the 3147 model. Processor also cannot be upgraded for the same reason.

TL;DR: This was given 3 stars, because as a standalone it's a fairly average and inexpensive device. Compared to the previous model this should probably be a 2 star rating due to cheaper materials/hardware and cosmetic changes. Ultimately feels like a downgrade over the older model.",
"The build quality of this computer is very good.
The battery life is acceptable.
BUT
This is the slowest computer I have ever used in my life. It takes FOREVER to start, to open a program, to load a webpage or just about ANYTHING else.

The advertisement when I bought it said that the 2MB memory can be upgraded. It CAN NOT be upgraded!!! Which is part of why it is so slow. But it is still slower than it should be for having no memory.

Without a shadow of a doubt, this is the worst computer I have ever owned in 30 years of computers and the worst Amazon purchase I have ever made.",
"Overall I'm satisfied with this laptop.  The size is small and it is very light to carry around.  The processor speed is fine for basic web browsing and video streaming.

One major negative of this laptop is that the standard Dell Wireless card is very poor.  It is only capable of 2.4GHz and I only got 20 Mbps speed.  Even opening a website was slow and sometimes it didn't work properly.  My dual band router or its settings could have been a factor but I could not find a setting that worked.  The wireless speed was so bad that I thought about returning it.  However, I found a simple upgrade that allowed me to connect to the 5 GHz band and get back the wireless speed at 800-900 Mbps.

I bought the following wireless card from Amazon and used the YouTube video link to learn how to access and remove the existing card.
-- 7260NGW Intel® Dual Band Wireless-AC 7260 802.11ac, Dual Band, 2x2 Wi-Fi + Bluetooth 4.0
-- [...]
A minor drawback is the keyboard and touchpad.  The keyboard keys feel stiff and the touchpad feels cheap and sometimes not sensitive or responsive.

But I think the laptop meets my needs pretty well at a decent price point.",
"No problems so far. I once made the mistake of buying an expensive Dell thinking it would last me longer. Not true when the mother board stops working and it's outside the warranty. So now, I buy cheap ones like these and just replace them when they stop functioning correctly without it being a big hit to my wallet. It works just fine for all my needs - mainly internet use. I store all my files in the cloud now (another lesson learned) so it doesn't bog down my memory and I don't lose everything when it inevitably won't turn on one day. My only frustration with this model is that the power button is flush with the right side of the computer. Sometimes when I am trying to move the computer around, I accidentally hit the power button. I would prefer if it were up near the keyboard so I don't bump it accidentally and put it in sleep mode. The lid is ultra glossy so I am sure it will get scratched very easily. I bought a simple neoprene sleeve (amazon basics) to store it in because I don't want it to look like garbage within a short time of having it. The power block on the cord is smaller than my last one, so that's nice. It's light so easy to carry with me and does the job. I'm satisfied.",
I bought this tablet in August of 18. As of today January 11th 2019 it won't charge. I've tried various chargers. Iwouldnt buy this product from this seller.,

My son loves his tablet. :),
Works perfectly so far. Great price,
Favorite tablet. We have 3.  Works great and nice screen size,
Replacement of a like item I broke.  I'm stilling it's capabilities.,
"Do not buy. This tablet will black out any time you change the screen, look away, open an app, in the middle of doing something important, etc. Sometimes 20 times in one sitting! Very frustrating and wasteful of my time.",
"did not come with 32 gig sd cards as stated could not contact seller ,bought two tab A s gave a 2 star for lack of advertised sd cards",
Love having a big tablet.  Works great and very easy to operate.,
Disappointed in the life of the tablet.,
"Loving it,  Great value",
great clarity.,
Very pleased with purchase,
Works great and it has long battery life,
"Was a gift, recipient is vey happy.",
Came with an sd card and was just as expected,

The headline says it all,
This is second Tab A my family has purchased.  Great value.,
Absolutely love it. Traded in my fire 10 for this one. Best decision,
Works perfectly and looks great as well ~ exactly what I wanted at a great price with free SD card!,
Have same item purchased at costco a year ago. So far working without any differences. Both also had 32 GB SD card.,
Replaced an old Galaxy TAB 2 with this and absolutely amazed at how fast it is.  Everything else works as expected.,
Battery has failed after a few months. This tablet was only used in my house. It never sat in a hot car or got wet. There is no reason it should have failed. It started with very sho re t battery life and now will not turn on at all. Even Apple products have better reliability than this tablet. Really havent used this tablet much at all. I am going to contact seller for an exchange/refund and will update review if received.,
Great picture.,
Absolutely love it.  Stays charged a long time,
"excelente  en todo sentido rapida , buena memoria",
This was a gift and my husband loved the size because he could use it in bed,
"I have bought two of these, great for long car rides with the little ones.",
We bought this as a gift for our 7 year old granddaughter. She loves it! Works great.,
Purchased for my aunt. Just like her phone but bigger so she was used to the interface. Perfect for her to relax and play games on the couch.,
This stopped working after a few months of use. Will not power on. Tried all the suggestions on u tube and Google. It was not supposed to be refurbished.  My son's last Samsung tablet lasted 6+ years and this one only a few months.  Would like to find out if we have any options to return or exchange?,
It was working very good. All of a sudden I can't use Google play store and the apps that I already download wouldn't work because it say I need Google play services which is not compatible with this device. Any one have same problem?,
I love mine my husband likes to play pub g and he say the quality is not the best,
Great upgrade from my old 1st generation Galaxy. Im very pleased overall. The switch from old to new was seamless with Samsung.,
No problems whatsoever with its operating.  Great Samsung quality.  I would definitely order from this seller again.,
Got this for WiFi capabilities (has pretty good reception characteristics),
"I bought this for my 83 year old mother and am glad I did, she couldn't be happier with the performance",
seems to be working fine so far,
Works well,
"Good tablet, nice for the price, ssd card is a cool add on. A little slow running, and occasional screen glitches...not sure why.
Major issue for me, arrived not factory sealed. No way to know if it`s reconditioned...and that's not indicated.

I bought a new tablet, not a used ot fixed one....and an update 3 weeks later!

Piece of junk....defective....screen whacked out. Some kind of glitch prevented reset couldn't send it back with all my data...

Do not buy!

Will never buy from this seller again...if it had been factory sealed an easy 4 stars...tablet issues would probably not exist either..

Rather angry about it....",
Sometimes it locks up when I play criminal case but I belive it's the game not the pad,
Perfect for my kiddos. They love them and they already had samsung kids downloaded which was perfect.,
"If you love android, this is your product!
My handicapped sister can use it and enjoy. Nice screen resolution and easy to work.",
Granddaughter loves the Samsung tablet.,
I liked that this product did everything I wanted  but at a lower price than i expected. Good to have the big screen and easy to use.,
Os is sound,
I love this thing. Not the highest end tablet but def works well for what it is. price wise its excellent.,
"aun se usa, y funciona perfecto",
"This is my first tablet, I've always just used phone or laptop before, but this gives me a nice in between option. Loving the size and the Samsung quaity is second to none!",
"I use my Samsung galaxy tab for everything from news, paying Bill's, banking, to playing games. I can slip my Samsung tablet in my purse  when I am on the go...fits my needs perfectly.",
"This was a present, it was the most favored of presents. Performs wonderfully.",
I purchased the galaxy tab A 10.1 inch tablet for my 3 year old son as a Christmas gift he loves it so much and can’t stay from off it he’s learning even more...Satisfied customer,
"Other than that, so far, it's a good product. Works as described.",
"I returned this because our original, which had died, was revived. That one has given great service for some years, and I'm sure when it does finally give up the ghost we'll replace it with something as close as possible.",
"This tablet is perfect!  We got it for our 12yr old son and he's loving it.  Very easy to use.  Beautiful, big screen.  Very happy.",
"This is my second Samsung Galaxy Tab A. The first one met our expectations. Decided on a second one for myself. Easy to transfer all my contacts from my Samsung S9 phone, and synced with Firefox was real easy.",
"Hola, a 1 año de uso se malogro hace 15 dias mi tablet, lo mande a servicio tecnico de Samsung de lima Peru, que es donde estoy en estos momentos y me cobran muy caro, mas rentable es comprar 1 nueva, me indican que la pantalla esta fallando, esta mal. Cual seria la solucion a este impase.
Gracias.

Carlos  Benites.",
"We bought this tablet for our mom for her birthday to replace an older model my sister had given her about 4 years ago. I love that the tablet is Android so it is easy to use and set up. BUT...3 months later and the tablet has had to be reset 4 times and will not operate properly. It works for a handful of uses and then will not turn on again. Our window of return closed in Sept and our service window closed in Oct. Wouldn't you know the next month the tablet starts giving us trouble! Very disappointed in this table as I have bought several Samsung tablets for my grand kids and have had good luck, guess my mom is just out of luck.....",
Good budget tablet. Touch screen sensitivity isn't to good. I had to reinstall apps to get them to open . Now that the kinks are worked out it seems to work fine.,
"My daughter bought this to play games and do school work on.  It seems like a good tablet. She doesn't need to crank the brightness up much to make it easy to see in a sun-lit room. The high resolution is excellent for reading text but the processor might be a little underspec'd for playing games (Minecraft and some other games are a little sluggish).  Overall though, it's a good deal.",
I love my Samsung Galaxy Tab A  10.1 tablet. I have not had any issues with it at all. I would recommend this tablet to anyone. It comes with so many different apps.  It was already set up and ready to use. Price was fantastic also. You can't go wrong with this tablet.,
"Not really an apple fan, so bought this as a gift.  Works as advertised, the recopient loved it.  Still does everything an apple product does without the pretentious attitude.",
Overall my only concern is misinformation in regards to the product capabilities. The only reason I purchased this specific item was because it was a dual sim card phablet.. the misrepresentation is extremely disappointing and heartbreaking and pisses me off!!!! But the speed and space are a plus so I can get over it??,
I’m very satisfied with this product. Especially the display and the quality (looks new). Was a bit sceptical about it cos I always read both the very bad and good reviews. However I decided to take a chance and I’m happy with it. Works well and no issues so far (1week+). I’d update if anything happens a while later.,
"Bought as Xmas gift for my retired husband. He's on it all the time, reading his kindle books, checking email, browsing internet, wasting time on Facebook, and streaming Netflix. A nice change from his heavy laptop and much better for traveling, small and lightweight. I bet he's on it over 10 hrs a day. He even lays in bed with headphones on watching cop shows until 11 pm at night. It's been great for him, but not so much for me. I'm now calling his tablet ""the other woman.""  Marital bliss, right?",
"Great mid-range tablet, so far. If you immediately update the firmware and the rest of the software on it you won't have any of the automatic shut off problems other used to list. It seems Samsung has fixed the problem quite a while ago. In terms of battery life, it's surprising how long this thing can hold a charge. If you're a heavy user (i.e. movie/shows back-to-back, digital drawing, constant web surfing) expect it to last all day. I'm a light user and have had the charge last me all week. As for the included SD card, while nice, you should really opt for a 256GB one. The paltry on-board space and the included SD card will fill up fast. If you can't, be aware that some apps can't be swapped over to the SD card to free up space on your tablet. For example Amazon's Audible app and Kindle app can be sent to external storage on the SD card, but Prime Video cannot. Also since this is a Samsung tablet it's full of their bloatware that most people don't end up using and takes up valuable space, though you can disable most of them so they're at least not taking up system resources. The tablet surprisingly boasts some nice privacy options for those uncomfortable with the prospects of being tracked or giving up personal data to Big Tech. Though if you're going to use this tablet you will probably need a Google account, but at least you can decide what info you wish to give them. The tablet feels sturdy and looks to be made with quality, but you'll probably want to get some sort of case and screen protector for it. Play it safe.  It comes with your standard micro USB charging cord, and an outlet charging adapter. I may be wrong, but I believe it's a fast charging adapter. I say this because I bought a magnetic charging cable for this tablet to reduce the strain on the charging port, and the magnetic cable claims to be fast charge capable as long as the device and its outlet adapter support it. So I tried it out and was able to charge this tablet to 100% in 45 minutes. Not too shabby. It also supports capacitive styluses if you feel so inclined to use one for note taking or drawing and editing.

So if you're looking for decently priced tablet as a starter, or one for your kids, this model ain't so bad. It won't have all the bells and whistles of say, a Galaxy Tab S5E or an iPad Pro, but that's ok, I'd rather not part with $500-$800 on a tablet anytime soon.",
"Admittedly, I hated Android and still hate Android devices. Clunky and hard to use, unintuitive. And prone to security hacks. Plus Google’s constant watch over everything you do. This is a fine device. I was forced to buy this Android device for a work project, and it works, although I would never purchase it by my own intention. It is inexpensive, however. My adage with Android devices is, however, you get what you pay for.",
Bought 2 and for price they work great. The only problem I had was after 9 months one stopped charging but spoke to Samsung tech and was given a repair ticket and free shipping both ways via ups. They repaired at no cost. Would definitely buy another Samsung product due to their customer service.,
This is a nice tablet and works great for the price. 16gb internal memory kind of sucks but put 128gb in mine and have all the space I need now. I like Samsung products and this tablet doesn't disappoint,
"Purchased this for $210 on Amazon. The quality and screen are excellent. I've put almost every App I use on my phone on here including Netflix, YouTube etc. Everything runs fast. 16GB memory not an issue - only using half that so far. The 32GB sim card included holds all the photos and audio files I need to carry on this tablet. Thoroughly recommend - not sure why you would spend upward of $600 for a 10.1 tablet - this one is excellent. By the way, I also purchased a MoKo case for $13 which was very good quality also. Thanks.",
Everything about this tablet and the description is exactly what you get. Very good for watching HD quality material the cameras very good and it comes with the 32GB card so you have a lot of extra space for the price well worth it. But I don't like is that on YouTube unless I'm not seeing a setting for some reason you cannot see or read or make comments on this featured tablet other than that I love it,
"This is amazing.  Have been using this tablet for a week checking out every feature.  Great screen, fast performance and the perfect size.  Found not a single problem with the software.  Connected a Bluetooth mouse (one that does not need a dongle) and a Bluetooth keyboard.  When connecting the mouse, a windows style mouse pointer appears on the screen.  The keyboard used is the Rii BT11 Ultra-slim Wireless Bluetooth Keyboard available on Amazon.  Cool keyboard because it works with Android and Windows.  I use one with my desktop because they are compact, have great feel, and are super portable.",
Not enough RAM. I returned the item,
Perfect,
Only had 32 gb CPU.  Received windows update right after I bought it and did not have enough cpu space to download update.  Returned laptop.,
"Product arrived broken. Touch screen doesn’t work properly. Can’t use touchpad is also broken, it doesn’t work.",
I'm so disappointed with the laptop I have been charging it for two days and it doesn't work,
Returned,
Esperaba un producto nuevo no usado,
"order was not as pictured, stated it had an HDMI port, it did not. Cover is also trying to peel.
Would like to return this item for a full refund.",
"It was super slow. I understand that it's not new, but I do expect a decent operating speed. Had to return it.",
"Be prepared for a life of constantly trying to find room where none exists just to keep the OS running.  Forget installing anything like a couple of videos for a trip or some music to listen to while you read the tablet.

Also, the switch between desktop and tablet mode (and why else would you be even looking at this thing?) is clunky.  Sometimes it switches, sometimes it never will, sometimes the screen flips but the keyboard remains active.

The world would be better off with any real tablet, or any real laptop.",
Good for a teenager,
"Slow processing computer. Good if just need a computer, not good if you need to get things done in a timely fashion",
"Purchased this laptop for work as I am a data processor and the screen rolls all by itself, very slow to access web pages and very slow at start up and I have literally not even installed anything on it! Definitely not a item to purchase for work or business purposes",
This little guy works wonderfully for me.  I absolutely love it.,
It's slow really really slow,
"This is a great little 2-in-1 tablet.  We use it in a warehouse environment, and with the covered ports, it's been doing really well.  It is on the heavy side for use as a tablet, but then again it is the smallest and least expensive option that would run the software we needed it to run.  It has our warehouse management software installed, and we use the built in WiFi for a connection to our domain and the server.  It works, but it does get a little touchy about keeping the connection to the server active when it goes to sleep.

For the price, it's a fantastic buy, even better than some of the more expensive ones out there.",
Love it for school work,
"My main issues with the laptop:
There was virtually no space, I literally have more space on my phone than this laptop.
The laptop felt very heavy for a small laptop.

If you work in (for instance) a warehouse environment, than this laptop would be a good fit. But if you're a student looking for a lightweight, low spec laptop, that's small and portable there are better options. Overall this laptop isn't that bad but it's just not a good fit for me personally.",
"Got this as a replacement for another laptop that had seen better days. This one is much smaller, lighter, and turns into a tablet if you don't want to use keyboard & mouse.",
"I needed a laptop that ran Windows OS for cheap, and I found this. First thing I noticed was everything was wrapped in a cheap plastic, which caused heating problems in the device. Upon removal of the plastic, scratches can be seen that were clearly trying to be hidden. This device also runs crazy slow, as I could not even download a single word doc without an issue. It may be cheap but still is nowhere near worth the price.",
"A little slow, but being a refurbished product it works quite nicely. I used to use an older laptop that wouldn’t update past windows 8. It is amazing. Most people’s expectations for this product are too high. Set your bar low and you will come out on top. Not too heavy, easy set up, all around a good work laptop for the price.",
"Great buy! Everything as described by the seller, easy to use, and it works great. I recently order the jumper Mini PC with 16GB RAM and 1024GB SSD, powered by the Intel N100 processor. I must say, this mini desktop computer has exceeded my expectations.

Easy to set up. It came pre-installed with Windows 11, which is a welcome addition as it offers a sleek and user-friendly interface. The 16GB RAM ensures smooth multitasking, allowing me to effortlessly switch between applications without any lag or slowdowns. The 1024GB SSD provides ample storage space for all my files, documents, and media.

The Intel N100 processor delivers impressive performance, with clock speeds of up to 3.4GHz. Whether I'm browsing the web, streaming videos in 4K UHD, or running demanding software, this mini PC handles it all with ease. The processing power is truly impressive, making it suitable for both work and entertainment purposes.

Connectivity options on this mini PC are top-notch. With WiFi 6 and Bluetooth 5.0 capabilities, I can seamlessly connect to the internet and pair my wireless devices without any hassle. The dual HDMI ports and Type-C port allow for versatile display options, making it convenient to connect multiple monitors or projectors. Watching content in 4K UHD resolution is a treat, thanks to the excellent graphics support.

I appreciate the compact and space-saving design of this mini PC. It fits perfectly in my setup without taking up much desk space. The build quality is solid, and the device feels durable and well-made. The overall performance and functionality of this mini PC make it a reliable and efficient companion for my daily computing needs.

In conclusion, the jumper Mini PC with its impressive specifications, ease of use, and excellent performance is a great investment. Whether you're a professional looking for a compact and powerful workstation or a home user seeking a versatile and capable entertainment hub, this mini desktop computer ticks all the boxes. I highly recommend it to anyone in need of a reliable and feature-rich computing solution.",

"Upon first power on serious problems with screen interface and user interface existed. Allowed several updates to complete with some taking overnight, problems just got worse. Finally there was no task bar. Returned to Amazon, they accepted return but messed up marking as returned. Had to call multiple times with agents admitting to Amazons error, problem would be taken care of, got charged again for no return when tracking number clearly showed it being returned. My account put a hold on the money and Amazon stated I would have to wait until bank processes the erroneous charge before a credit could be issued and then processed and I’m still out the money as of this writing.",
"The description ""Wireless LAN, Bluetooth, Ethernet"" is wrong.
The computer does not have an Ethernet port.
There is no way to use a wired Ethernet connection.",
"It looks like NEW!!!
Thanks.
It's really nice.",
Really fast - no glitches,
Item is not good,
La laptop no me funciona. Muchas vueltas el servicio técnico de HP. Al final la arregle yo comprando un disco nuevo. Ahora me funciona bien. Pero la calidad del disco anterior es muy mala.,
"The laptop did not come with an ethernet port as described. This product did not have the additional cables included in the listing. If any of these are must for you, do not buy from this seller.",
"I have protection on my computer so this is not a virus. The computer is horrible. It'll be working just fine and then all of a sudden it freezes and the only way to get it to do anything is a hard restart. I work on computers doing support so I know different workarounds, but it's the computer. I don't know if this one mis faulty or what, but it's awful!

I have done everything and yet it's still doing it. This is basically now a piece of garbage and I don't think they care because once you give them your money, they move on. Too many people buying from them and no accountability!
____

I was able to send this back to get repaired and wanted to update about interaction at that point. I sent the computer to be repaired and the seller had provided a label so that was free. My tracking number indicated it had been received so I waited to hear from them telling me they'd gotten it. Nothing. So I emailed them and they finally did say they'd gotten it and I should give them 10 days and they'd send it back. No updates, nothing. I'm just supposed to divine, I guess, what they're doing and hope and pray that I get the computer back working. Not happy. I mean, glad they're willing to repair this, but it would sure be nice if they would take time to update me.

I have returned it twice for repairs and it's doing the same thing. And the restocking fee is $125. This is a big scame. Please don't fall for it!!!!!!!!!",
"First one came with a cracked case, and the replacement crashed after 5 months.",
Excellent,
Product did from day one...setting ig up....,
It does not work straight out the box,
Perfecto,
Does not work. I bought a refurbished one. Horrible do not buy. Returning this one.,
Lasted four days following erratic freezing and loss of configuration.  Fourth day went into endless reboot.,
"Funcionó solo unas pocas horas, luego comenzó a reiniciarse y no funcionó nunca más, tuve que devolverlo a Amazon",
"The tape of Linksys already remove.
Signal very low, drop randomly. Distance of good signal very short.
Dont buy this product anyway!",
GreT WiFi router with excellent range.,
"Great and fast wifi, but only for 10 seconds a time.
Router keeps rebooting every 10 to 20 seconds, so it's impossible to work with.",
Plugged it in changed admin password and everything already works,
The router would fail to transmitt or reciece after just a few hours requiring a restart. Might have been a hard to detect defect but it appears to be a common issue.,
"I put 1 star because don't have 0. The product not working,  costumer services not help me went I call they. I return  and want my money back. Lost my time .",
This product did not work at all their customer service sucks and I'm returning the product You don't even have people on the other end of the phone that know what they're doing or that speak good English,
Easy to install but still get some skips in my streaming.,
"The people who check this items do a terribly job, the router star all light but did not emits any wifi signal, and don;t do the reset even you waits a minute. I did not recomend this item and this seller.",
"The worst purchase ever. The unit worked great straight out of the box. Then one day later it was losing it's 2.4/5ghz radios. I understand I could have called tech support, but really I expect simple things to work straight out of the box.
Also I purchased a second unit frtom amazon and the exact same problem happend. I'm now rocking the netgear nighthawk x10 with no problems whats so ever.",
"I was previously adviced about this linksys routers, just for being very practical: This line of router almost all router of linksys have an a distressfull factory damage in the hardware and software that cannot be solved yet, they reboot and reboot and reboot neither a hard reset nor firmware update can solve that. Tech support is the worst waste of time 1:30hrs on the phone doing the same unusefull reset. Do not waste your money or time buying linksys, buy Netgear or Asus.",
"I purchased a refurbished linksys router.  After 2 or so days of normal operation, the device stopped broadcasting on the 2.5 ghz channel.  Probably why it was returned in the first place.  I spent 45 minutes on the phone with linksys support and they couldn't get it working (resetting router, updating firmware, etc.).  I did some internet research and found that the issue I experienced was fairly common.  I returned the router via amazon.

I ordered another refurbished model (this time I stepped up to the EA9400) and it worked for about a day before it became stuck in a reboot mode.  Even a reset attempt of the router would not get it out of this reboot ""loop"".  Found many others had experienced the same and it required sending back the unit.

I WILL NEVER BUY A REFURBISHED LINKSYS PRODUCT AGAIN.  THEY OBVIOUSLY DON""T DO ENOUGH TO FIND THE ORIGINAL PROBLEM ON RETURNED DEVICES.  THEY SIMPLY FLASH THE SYSTEM, DUST IT OFF AND PACKAGE IT BACK UP TO BE SOLD TO THE NEXT UNSUSPECTING VICTIM...",
Delivered as promised and great product,
Bought one it came with the wrong power cable send that one back just to receive one that’s just plain non functional. Don’t buy renewed from amazon. It’s just their used garbage. I mean both of them looked used af.,
"First one worked for less than two days before getting constant disconnects on the 5.0 GHz band. Returned that unit and promptly received a replacement. The second unit worked for two weeks before the 2.4GHz band went down completely, no RF signal detected by any device. Rebooted and the the 5.0 GHz band had the same symptom. A factory reset didn’t resolve the symptoms. Returning this unit for a refund.",
"This review is for Linksys EA9400 Max-Stream AC5000. There is a mix of reviews for different models.

This is an older model with a lot of issues. The first one I got did not work well. The speed was good as long as it stays up. I'm returning this and tried another one. It works great with no issues.

The first  EA9400 Issues:
1. Wifi signal comes up very slow. It took almost 5 mins to see the wifi signal
2. Dropped the wifi signal 4 times within 24 hours. You have to restart and wait for 5 mins to show up.",
"Don’t buy the Renewed product. This unit was great for about 20 minutes after that the unit starting resetting it self. It would never come back online. It’s not worth the hassle to save a few dollars. I am returning the unit and buying a new one.

In most cases refurbished items are quality control inspected for optimum performance but because this unit is a renewed product, I have to believe it was not properly refurbished. Buyer beware save your self a head ache and buy a new unit.",
Great price on well executed renewed router. Looks and works like new.,
"Tried to set the router up, but wes stopped at every try. Called support and after a good bit of workaround, got into the setup. Connected the unit to our netwrok (small business) and then attached the USB external drive. The router started rebooting on its own. Got past that and set up the driver for access. Hung up with support, then the entiire unit went offline again. Reset it, then tried to connect to phone. Wireless strength was only 1 or 2 bars right next to the unit. Also no internet connection on wireless, but did have internet connection on ethernet. Nex day called support aagain. Began another long, drawn out process to troubleshoot, then tech stopped and said to return unit to Amazon. Hh then wanted to upsell me to the EA9500 for $160 more than I paid for this unit and buy it directr from Linksys. I said no thank you and ended the call. Complete disaster. DO not buy the EA9xxx series of routers. There is serious trouble. Do some internet searches and you will see. Buyer beware!",
"Tengo menos de 3 meses con ella y me sale pantalla azul. Se desconfigura la tarjeta de video cuando quiere. son las dos cosas que me ocurren, así como las luces del teclado las apaga y prende cuando quiere. Por todo lo demás es un muy buen equipo para programas de diseño de ingeniería.",
Very powerfull small computer.  Very fast processor.,
"Everything as described, no issues so far. Shipping was fast, highly satisfied.",
This product beats the competition. light weight with lite keyboard,
"Light and quick - starts up instantly, great machine.",
Excellent experience for this product,
Great computer,
The hard drive was moved around and computer completely useless now. Before was a great computer. Get a solid state drive not this exact computer,
The,
Perfect,
Until moment very good laptop. I like it,
I even don't have a chance to turn it on it was a broken laptop,
"Laptop did not work. Was a gift for my wife so cant return it since when she oppend had pasa the 30 day return.
Old text files on the computer, so it must be refurbished!!!",
Great laptop. Lightening fast. Dell did it again!!,
Perfect fit for our small needs,
Perfect laptop for my needs!,
The laptop was super fast but the SSD crashed after dropping it.,
Be careful. I bought this laptop 10 months ago and have emailed the seller twice and still not response. The laptop is dead and will not boot up. I have learned my lesson the hard way.,
"No es el equipo que pedí. Me llego un equipo de 15 pulgadas y un procesador I5, no es por lo que pague.  Yo pedí un equipo de 13 pulgadas con procesador I7.",
Really good laptop for the price.,
Good powerful laptop at a great price.,
Everything is as expected,
We are waiting for more use to comments,
early Christmas gift for my daughter.  she loves it.,
The product is good,
Perfect Laptop for student. Its really friendly for student like us.,
"Within 6 months of buying it, the keyboard started giving me trouble. Some of the keys just stopped working. At this point, the entire keyboard has stopped working. I feel like I wasted $800. You are better off not buying it.",
No problems with it. My college bound engineering student was thrilled.,
"I ordered this laptop on March 5th and the battery has already lost most of its ability to charge. For example, 20 minutes ago the laptop was claiming that I had 2 hrs 48 min remaining of battery life. Now, it's saying that I have 19 minutes of battery life.",
"This computer is fast, slim, and easy to use. It fits my needs perfectly.",
"First, I was disappointed with the poor quality of the package. It was not safe enough to protect a laptop. Then, I am returning it in a day after I received a laptop because the speaker has a problem with making noise when it plays. I may pick a wrong egg, but it's very disappointing anyway.",
"Apenas acabo de recibir el computador y me está dando problemas con la señal de Internet. Me sale un mensaje que dice: ""El adaptador qualcomm qca61x4a 802.11ac wireless adapter está experimentando problemas de controlador o harware""
¿Que debo de hacer? ¿Cómo reclamo?
Tengo muy poca experiencia en compras en línea.. ..",
"The touchpad didn't work, I had to return the laptop to Amazon",
The best part is this laptop came with a 4k display but battery does not last very long,
"Great laptop, quick, quiet, excellent graphics and sound. After many Lenovos a real step up in quality!!!",
Liked the price,
the Amazon part was great. the computer died during a software update and had to send it to the Dell for repair.,
So much on the internet forums about how this Dell makes your speakers pop.  With mine.  It was true.  Also had a problem with saying it didn't recognize it's own power charger.  Yet another thing everyone talks about on the web with this laptop.  Nothing but headaches.  Returned for refund.,
Purchased this for my 16 year old son for school. Cannot praise this laptop enough,
Nice I enjoy it,
No complaints so far. Comes with the pen but it's not that good. I have had it for a month now.,
"Good laptop/tablet indeed. I was surprised that it is even cheaper than Costco, and with the high-end screen. I am pleased with it.",
This Laptop i'm using for 9 months it's super fast!!!! very portable as well!!!!,
I love it. It just rocks in performance. It kills anything you throw at it. Intel quad core cpu's are performing really well.,
Compré tres computadoras de éstas y ya no funcionan dos . Duraron menos de un año y otra sólo 14 meses . A una no le funciona la pantalla y a otra le falló el teclado . Son una porquería . No las recomiendo  porque nosotros somos muy cuidadosos con las mismas y las usamos muy poco .????????,
Ordered it for my sister and she had it set up with no complication at all... maybe I should get one for myself????,
"Excellent buy, saved few hundreds and my son loves it. Highly recommend this laptop.",
"Good delivery speed. But the quality is no good.
There’s no display after setup. Only HDMI workable.",
"I ordered this item on Oct 30, 2018, when it was advertised as ""2018 Dell Inspiron 13 5000 2-in-1 13.3 inch Full HD Touchscreen Backlit Keyboard Laptop PC, Intel Core i7-8550U Quad-Core, 8GB DDR4, 256GB SSD, 2 USB""

On registering this device on Dell's website, it became obvious that an older 2017 laptop with 'almost' expired warranty was fraudulently passed off as  a newer 2018 model!!",
"I love this laptop! I imported it all the way to south africa, and I couldn't be happier. The seller even included the dell active pen :D",
This product was a waste of my money. The charger is so bad. It hasn't been working well and i had to borrow my brother's. The screen also freezes time to time. Now i have to buy a new charger and at some point a new laptop. I had this for less than two years. I'm really disappointed with this.,
Got this for my wife and she loves it.  The computer talks to you and does what you want it to do.  Need to train it to walk the dogs!,
"So far so good!  Almost returned though because of the ""adaptive"" charging not allowing it to charge past 55%.  Had no idea that this was something that machines do nowadays!",
The only thing I dislike about this product is the computer bottom gets very hot in the middle when used.,
So far I love it!! Can hook my wireless mouse up or use the pad or touch screen! Don’t really care for the bulky charging cord but other than that haven’t found anything... adjusting using windows 10,
"Looks pretty, works awfully. Most problems are with keyboard and touchscreen. If I lived in the US, I would undoubtedly send it back to the seller. Bad choice, I`m really disappointed with this purchase. Atfer all the updates had been installed, virtual keyboad stopped functioning too.  Now it is impossible to enable it absolutely. It`s my first and the last dell product. Many ""thanks"" to both dell and this seller for the troubles I haven`t expected. In comparison with Lenovo Yoga 910 I bought a month earlier, this item is rather f piece of shit than a nootebook.",
"Brought this laptop month back.
Fully satisfied",
Excelent product.,
"Received this ~4 weeks ago. I added a new partition to the SSD and installed Arch Linux on that partition. I'm able to boot into either OS without trouble.

The touchscreen is responsive but not impressive. The construction seems good.",
"I like it, but I have to return it because it is getting too hot in the bottom. I did not see other users talk about this problem in their reviews.",
"I bought this in fall 2018. By January 2019 the fan was extremely loud. Contacted Dell and sent the computer in to have the fan replaced. After my origial laptop was lost in shipping, I was sent a replacement. One year later the fan is back to making the same exact noise as before (and now past the warranty). I would recommend a different laptop.",
General recordkeeping and videos,
"Everything was great....until a dell update crashed my Inspiron 13 less than 4 months in. The touchpad wasn’t perfect, and the battery didn’t last very long, but I had absolutely no problems and would have given it 4-5 stars, until the damn automatic dell update. Now I log in and the restart screen pops up freezing everything until it restarts and repeats the process, over and over... After reading the reviews, most seem to be within a few months of purchasing. Are these things just built to not last? Not sure if it’s an isolated problem or Dell, but it’s unacceptable regardless. Be cautious before purchasing as it’s going to be a pain trying to get repaired/replaced",
"Purchased in August 2018.  In the last two months, the keyboard malfunctioned (various keys simply do not work), the laptop simply shut down and would not restart, and now again various keys are not working.  Dell has ""fixed"" each problem without cost to me, but it takes about 10 days to two weeks between malfunction, call customer service, receiving a shipping box from Dell, and then waiting for its return from the regional service center.  When it is not broken, it is fast, screen is bright and does what I need.  But 30 plus days out for repairs in 9 months is unacceptable.  Will not purchase a Dell again",
Use as both laptop and tablet. Very versatile.,
"So far absolutely no issues, works great, fast, and I like the keyboard backlight.  I am a realtor so on it continuously,  battery life holds well.  Set up was a breeze, very happy with this purchase",
Good running product however had dead pixles on the screen when using the stylus would not pick it up sent back to try another one hope it's just a one time incident. Other than that loved it.,
Nice laptop but it says in several places that it has 12 GB RAM while it only comes with 8.,
"best computer i have ever bought personally.  fast, been using on and off for two days on same battery.  came with pen, idk who i bought from but if it says windows ten home you wont have office on it.  still a good buy.  i recommend thus far.",
So far I have only used it as a laptop.  Hope it is as good as a tablet.,
"In terms of performance, pretty good. Quick and great touchscreen.

But it is LOUD. The fan runs near constant and after just a couple days I now have a loud, high pitched squealing.

Great performance. Poor construction.",
"Love this laptop. It is fast, easy to use, has touchscreen capability, and can fold into a tent or tablet. It's reasonably priced new and is certainly quite durable. The screen reaches fairly close to the edges and is a great viewing size. It feels well made and durable.",
I bought it for my office work. I am satisfied with the performance but feels it should be better if it had more memory space.,
Laptop is very good but the noisy fan is soooooooooooo irritating.  I am going t take it in to have it checked out. And now 4 months later this laptop has crashed!!!! Seriously! Now I am looking for dell support because I cannot return it!!! Smh...,
"Since my purchase my laptop has seen and been through a lot, can handle daily use, travel, hours of work and/or play. I love my laptop. The only thumbs down is it's battery life. Depends on how often you utilize it, you'd be looking at buying a new battery replacement within a years time.",
"Had planned to go back to HP since my first Dell Inspiron didn't last 2 weeks before the screen cracked from a very minor drop and continued to get worse so no touch screen. However, I just could not find an HP that had all the features I wanted and could afford: Touch Screen, Backlit keyboard, 360 2-in-1, CoreI7, black keyboard with gray trim - I love it!",
Everything run normally except the fan noise a little bigger than my expectation. Can I adjust the CPU Frequency from 1.8G to a higher frequency?,
This dell 2 in one is different then the old designs. Material is Plastic. Old design material was metal made.,
"love it, just what i needed. I've had it for a month now and had no issues with it, the size is perfect not too big not too small and is very light easy to carry around, the screen flips which is awesome for watching movies on bed, it came with a pen but i don't use it",
"I have been using Dell for 9+ Years and i have changed almost 4 models till now but this model Inspiron 5379 is really giving my nightmare. I have contacted customer care 4 times(every time there's new operator and you have explained everything from beginning) for support and even sent to texas for repair still same problem is repeating. I asked Dell for a refund so that I could upgrade my model but no commitment on that. Laptop have an amazing configuration in cheap price but it's not worth risk buying it with such annoying noise. I thought it's only me but there are lot's of people facing fan issues with this model. Anybody who's considering buying this please think over before you purchase it, better spend a few bucks and get a good one instead of buying this one. I am really unhappy with dell support on this matter and dealing with the issue.",
"The computer I purchased is supposed to come with windows 10.  Once you start the computer up, it requires the windows product key to activate it.  I was not provided a product key to enter.  I called Beach Camera customer support and told the rep my problem, and she recommended I call Amazon.  Then she told me nevermind, call the manufacturer.  This is not the customer support I felt I should get.  There is no reason purchasing from a third party if they cannot facilitate successful installation and startup of the product they sell.  I won't buy from Beach Camera again.",
"Don't listen to the one star reviews. This is a great laptop for serious workloads. If you are getting this as a gaming laptop, just buy a gaming laptop or a gaming PC. It drives me crazy how many people just don't know how to take care of a computer and then give it a 1 star rating when they break it. A computer is only as useless as its user.",
"The computer gets very hot. power just go  off sometimes, while fully charged. The eye scanner identification tried many times before it works. Maybe my computer is defective. Just purchased 1-2 weeks brand new.  Like the touch screen. Size is good, I like the computer, if it will just work well??. Am first time am writing a review lol.",
"Got this Dell laptop 4 months ago, to date, performed nicely and speedy. The only drawback is the casing feels a bit flimsy. Great great product for the price.",
"Excellent dimensions, quick response, great touchscreen, my opinion is generally positive.
Very happy with that purchase.

The only issue is that the laptop is overheating, but only sometimes. Sure, that is not a reason to avoid buying this laptop. Having a cool temperature in the room should fix that problem, or even buy a stand or a cooler. When you take care of your things they last more.

Recommended!",
Battery life deteriorated quickly and wifi stopped working completely which turned out to be internal hardware issue. Factory warranty ended within a few months of purchase as the laptop shipped to me was at the tale end of this warranty. A friend if mine works for Dell's supply chain supervision and he said Dell's parts are becoming worse and worse as the company looks for cheaper parts to have their products compete with it's Chinese competitors. Essentially a race to the bottom in quality and the people working for Dell know this. It was a great laptop when it worked. However the quality of it working lasted just months not even a year.,
"The most speedy delivery ever. I was not expecting pen, thanks to the vender. I appreciate. I was using Dell xps before. I almost fell in live with this one in 2 days. Really worth in this budget.",
"I have not had this computer very long and have not had time to really take it through it's paces thoroughly. But that being said, it definitely does the things I need from a small laptop, and I would recommend it.",
"Like another user mentioned, my laptop had bad issues with overheating - like it burned my legs if I had it on my lap. I returned it and ordered another, assuming I had received a bad egg, and while it still gets hot (especially when using in tablet mode due to where the air vents are located) it's tolerable. It's key to just be aware of where the vents are while using it and not sitting with it in tablet mode for too long.",
"This is one of the best laptops I've owned in every regard except for the battery life. My old laptop (an Acer) lasted days while this laptop lasts for hours. Also I'm still getting used to not having the number pad on the side, but that's a non-issue",
"This laptop is just fine till you figure out that it Doesn’t charge !!! There is obviously something wrong with the charger that came with the computer. Now every-time I plug in the computer it says:” AC adaptor is unrecognized. It might not charge the computer and it will run slower”. I plugged it in over night just to wake up and find battery didn’t charge. Now, I can’t use this laptop unless it’s plugged in and it runs slow !!! It makes me wonder whether the charger that came with the computer was ever an orginial one in the first place!!! For the first month it worked just fine although I had the same message popping every time I charge it. Now, after several months it won’t charge any more !! I need a solution for this, I shouldn’t be paying to get another charger because there was some problem with the original one.",
"I am going to be frank. I read the reviews and decided to take my chances as there seemed to be more positive than negative reviews. That was my mistake.

Over the last few days I had been having some issues with my laptop because it did not seem to be charging. At first I attributed this to the charger and ordered another one. Well, when it got here and there was no sign of the laptop charging I knew that this was something else. I tried the old charger in a last ditch effort and the light from the charger would be green right up until I plugged it into the laptop then it would turn off.

I called Amazon and they directed me to Dell support where I was told that it was something in the hardware and that these things happen and not to worry.

Well I am very f-n worried because I had a ton of assignments for school on there that I can't access because the laptop that I paid good money for turned out to have shoddy craftsmanship. I now have to wait 10-12 days for repairs. I have had this laptop for less than 3 months. In what world do things require repair when you've just bought them?!

Do yourself a favor and look somewhere else if you want a laptop that will last. If you'll excuse me I'll be trying to redo my assignments from scratch for the next several days ??",
"The machine arrived as scheduled and was correct in the box, but the laptop was not without it's problems.  Upon setup the fans were loud and the machine became very hot.  The active pen that came with it worked the night of setup but not the next day.  After 1.5 hours on chat with Dell support they were able to install different drivers and troubleshoot the fan and the heat.  Now it runs quite and cool.  They could not fix the pen and promptly shipped a new one for exchange.  I'm very happy with it so far and would recommend it.  Just be prepared to contact support.",
"I'm a mac user ,well was until I got asked by my teacher to change because of certain differences that office has in mac. I honestly thought I wasn't gonna like dell that much. But it did surprise me. I have only used it for some days, buts it's been great. the size, the efficiency, the software is awesome. I love the simple that is to do some things compared to mac. It does get a little hot, but just if your using at the most, it doesnt affect me atleast, in my day to day internet searching and netflix. Something im adjusting to is the touchscreen, maybe is my first impression, but i find difficult to use the computer using my fingers, it only works well with the pen that includes the computer, but in general good.",
"My first Windows 10 computer, and my first flipbook after using a MacBook and then a Chromebook. Overall, a solid computer. But the touchpad is not sensitive enough. Clicks don't get registered the first time. Moving the mouse just a little with touchpad doesn't work, usually. I had to turn off pinch to zoom because it was always activating when I didn't mean for it to. Same with right-click in the lower right corner. And still I have problems, even after those changes to settings.

Use of some websites is frustrating because of this. And this after turning touchpad sensitivity up to high. On one job app website, I had to click everything two or three times to get it to work. Even typing this review was frustrating because the cursor would jump around.

Otherwise, a fine computer for the price. Far less frustrations in tablet mode. Maybe a firmware or OS update will resolve this issue. Or maybe someone in comments can fill me in on the right tweak to settings.",
"I have had this laptop for about 2 years now and I use it almost daily. This thing is fantastic. I have not had any issues with it besides that fact that it gets a bit hot. The vents in the back are not large enough to support the laptop cooling well on its own, but I just purchase a cooling pad and keep it on there and the temps run just fine. The newer version of this laptop accommodates for this issue and I know because I just purchased it for my partner and he's loving it. This is a really great series of laptop and I highly recommend it. It functions great and has features that we needed: backlit keyboard, touchscreen, 2-in-1 (can flip it flat), and then the hardware specs combine to make this one great purchase.",
"Face recognition isn't the best, and have had weird issues with internet connectivity. Anytime I turn this laptop on, the wifi completely cuts out, and this has never happened with any other device, with there being a total of 4 laptops and 1 PC in the house with other devices. Thought it was our router or provider, but beginning to think that this is an issue with the laptop drivers with the way it came. Good laptop, but the internet issue is a massive pain",
Nice computer. easy to start up and load my programs.  Love the touch screen feature.  I add more memory so the computer runs super fast.  Ordered on Sunday and had it delivered to my house by Wednesday.  Easy to get up running especially for someone who is technically challenged.,
"I was a little apprehensive ordering this laptop due to the lack of enough reviews, and also from reviews from other tech sites. Some about the brightness of the screen, some about the quality of the RGB color gamut range, some about the ""junk"" included with the laptop.
I received the laptop fast with Amazon Prime, in very good packaging and good condition. Initial setting was a breeze, and immediately had a good feeling about the speed of the hardware/system. Once all windows updates were applied, I always go to control panel to remove all unwanted ""junk"". Surprised that there was not any at all. Pretty clean, and I did not have to remove anything. There was not MacAfee,  nor other annoying trial versions of any programs. Only some Windows apps, mostly games, that it was easy to remove from the store. That was very good, and went on installing my own programs such as Office 2016, ACDsee photo suit, etc. No problems. The screen quality is pretty good, I did not get this laptop for photo editing, I do that on my desktop. As far as the screen brightness is concerned, people seem to not take under consideration that a good part of it is tide to the power plan used by the user. That is very easily changed under the notification panel on the right of the taskbar, where the brightness of the screen can be control to taste. Then you can have a much brighter screen. I am not sure that it will be bright enough for ""interrogations"", however is bright enough for me.
Bottom line, I am very pleased with the laptop. It's portability is a fun aspect of its use. It is a good looking laptop, and yes, so far I love it.
I would recommend this laptop for general and comfortable use. Please remember, it is not an $1,800.00 machine, but it is perfect for what was meant to be used on this price range, and a joy to use.
Additionally, it is upgradeable, so one will not have to pay that $1,800.00 price for more memory and larger storage capacity.",
"This laptop is perfect in every way.

It's pretty compact and light - so it's perfect for bringing to work or classes. The laptop is well-made and can probably sustain some abuse.
The battery is outstanding. It easily gets 8 to 12 hours on a single charge. This is with normal usage (normal screen brightness, browsing/using Word with no volume).
The touch screen and touch pad both work great. I haven't had any issues with either of these.
Sound quality is very good. The display is beautiful.

This laptop also has quite a bit of horsepower. It can process quite a few programs at once, and it boots up quickly. I'm always too lazy to close unused programs, and this laptop has been pretty forgiving in that regard. Oddly, this laptop is also good at connecting to the internet. It's great at great strong signals.
The keyboard is great. Keys are well-placed and easy to press.

This laptop isn't the best for gaming. It can run games, but not nearly as well as something you'd get from a gaming laptop. I don't use it for gaming, so that's fine. If this laptop were $1500, I wouldn't question it. You're really getting a lot of bang for your buck here in terms of specs. And I haven't had any glitches or problems to speak of. Just get rid of the anti-virus program, it's annoying.",
"I bought this laptop after my previous unit crapped out on me. Considering the price tag, I expected it be pretty decent, however, I have had problems with this Dell literally from the beginning.

From the first time I booted up, I was presented with a screen stating ""AC POWER ADAPTER WATTAGE AND TYPE CANNOT BE DETERMINED."" Despite this, the laptop charged just fine, however, just two days later, the laptop will no longer charge, and when I hover over the battery icon, it says, ""(plugged in, not charging)."" When I check the BIOS at startup, it says AC Adapter type is ""UNKNOWN."" I am using the same 45W Dell AC adapter that came with the computer. The adapter appears to be in perfect condition, and the green LED light is on. I have tried plugging it in to different outlets in my home, and I receive the same result. I tried updating the BIOS. I used Dell's online diagnostic tool for hardware problems, as well as the diagnostic tool specifically for this AC charging problem, but no problems were detected.

I emailed Dell's Tech support, detailing all of the information above, and they clearly did not read my email, because they asked me to do all of the things I already mentioned. They then told me I could send it back for repairs that will take 10-12 days to complete.

What bothers me most about this, is that if you do a quick Google search regarding this AC adapter problem, you will immediately get results regarding Dell computers, so this is clearly a problem they are aware of. I did not spend $800 in order to receive a faulty product that the manufacturer is aware is faulty. I use this unit for schoolwork, and being without it for 12 days is an unreasonable expectation. At this point, I am debating whether I want to get it fixed or just send it back for a refund. I did not want a Dell to begin with, but this seemed like a good deal. I am now regretting that decision.",
"I was very excited to receive this 2 in 1 earlier this week! The quality and design or the machine seems sturdy and functional. Unfortunately the machine freezes regularly and i must constantly restart. Now the track pad doesn't work at all. I had worries when the computer arrived unprotected bouncing around a big box without any documentation and without a stylus. I suspect the seller sent a refurbished model.
  •• update ••
I returned the first computer and bought the same model again from another seller. So glad I did!! Thankfully Amazon makes it so easy to return! The new one arrived with proper packaging, documentation and a stylus. The previous one was clearly used before. Th is one arrived with a clean install of Windows 10 and is working great. As mentioned in other reviews the bottom gets hot. I put something between the laptop and my lap so that's not too much of a concern. This is the perfect size to carry around is very sturdy. I am enjoying being able to easily switch to tablet mode.",
Setup was easy and have been really enjoying the significant upgrade in speed compared to my old ASUS. Touchscreen has worked well and just used the pen to ink my signature on some online forms and it worked great. Don't know about long term durability but initial quality has been awesome.,
"I've only had this for a day so far, but it's amazing! Nice display, great speakers, supported by Waves Maxx audio. Also great performance, thanks to the 8gb ram and i7 processor. It will get hot, but it won't affect the computer's performance, just might cause you some discomfort. Everything is quite fast, especially the SSD. Moving over from a traditional hard drive, and it makes a HUGE difference in speed.",
"Very sluggish. It might be defective so I decided to return it without replacement. If I buy another tablet, I need to get a more expensive one.",
"Impossibly slow. Can’t run a single “default” app like GMail without hanging for 10+ seconds at a time. Heaven forbid you reboot, because it’s unusable for 2+ minutes afterwards.

You get what you pay for.",
It started off working ok and as the day went on it got slower and slower then it stayed freezing. NOT a good look I retired it 2 days later,
I'm planing return right now tablet is terrible all around except battery duration,
"Bought it for my autistic daughter. Worked fine for a couple of days; and I’ve tried everyday for the past few days, and it will Not take us to the apps we’ve stored, and now I can’t even take them off for this return. Always live Amazon, but this was very disappointing ??",
This thing isn't worth $5 I got it so I could connect a wifi app and have it run. That was the only thing I downloaded. It crashed more times then I could count. Not worth it,
Very slow in operations.  Am returning it.,
The tablet is not worth buying it freezes or the URL doesn't work or some system things don't work and nothing will download and nothing works on it it's the worst tablet I've ever owned that's why I'm returning it it been sent back by ups on July 18.,
I got my item LIKE,
Super super slow. Touch screen is not very sensitive. Have to keep pounding. Save your money.,
"I got this tablet for my son's birthday, and he wasn't playing with it, I got on it and when it does work it's very very slow, don't waste your money. If I could give zero Stars I would.",
"It’s just garbage nothing else. Doesn’t work at all, it takes 3-5 mins to loading app. After use while it get stopped by self …????
Do not recommend this product at all 24/7",
"This mini PC is just that ""MINI"" this PC is just over 5 inches square and 1.75 inches tall but don't let that bother you it preforms well as a desktop computer.  I have been using this PC during the past couple weeks for internet access, word processing, minor photo editing and low level game play.  The response time for these general tasks has been very good.  There have been no problems or errors, everything is running smoothly, and the noise level is almost non-existent limited to an occasional whirl of a small fan. I believe this computer will work well as a desktop computer but lacks sufficient graphics power to play any but the most basic 3d games,  and has insufficient CPU capacity to be used as a workstation for number crunching computer programs, but for an extremely small profile computer it works well.",
"VNOPN K5-F14H mini pc is quiet and very capable of performing day to day tasks nicely. It appears to be well constructed, tight seams and smooth surfaces with even paint job.

There’s a total of 8 USB-A ports, unfortunately not all are USB-3, only front 4 with single USB-C port along with 4 video outs which is a combination of 2 DP and 2 HDMI on back.

Case cover is constructed of plastic with honeycomb pattern, not a fan as it makes cleaning harder, along with fan intake on top and side vents. Intake opening are fairly large and no removable mesh filter helping to keep particles out.

Windows 11 setup did not go through normal out-of-box experience process, like selecting preferences or connecting to Wi-Fi network, it automatically sign in as administrator. Appreciate it did not come preinstalled with bloatware which is nice, unlike some other manufactures, just standard Microsoft junk.

I’m able to run all my applications without issue and even able to play older game like Mass Effect Legendary Edition at higher resolution. Noticed fan continuously spins up and down even when not working on anything intensive, like web browsing.

Minor annoyance, not all USB-A ports being USB-3, there’s no justification for having older USB-A ports.

Be mindful, device is stuck with loaded BIOS as vendor doesn’t appear to have website for support.",
"Lightning speed fast! With the i7 quadcore and a minimum of 8g of ram, this laptop can do day to day tasks without breaking a sweat!  So far we’re loving it! And for the price - get it now before they’re gone!",
Very user friendly.Easy to set up for you use.,
"I’m using this for schooling, and it a great computer.",
This laptop is used by one of my salesmen who was just not getting enough performance speed out of is 8GB laptop. He loves it.,
"mouse pad lags NOT VERY SENSITIVE, Battery Life is weak 40%",
Overall a good product. No issues so far!,
I only gave a 4 star because I thought I read that the key board was lite and its not.  Otherwise very happy with purchase!,
"I was so excited to see the box arrive!! Opened everything up, read the instructions, plugged it in and whole it was charging, I started to put all the boxes in the recycling bin. Get back to the laptop and start going thru the start up process and find out that the touchpad, touch screen and stylus don't work. SO DISAPPOINTED! Had to get the boxes out of the trash and box the unit up in order to return it.",
This computer has suited all of my needs so far. I bought it because I am half way through my bachelor's degree and plan to go on to get my masters. I needed a computer that would hold up over the years with vigorous use! This laptop has an abundance of storage and holds its charge very well.,
This laptop is great for our college student.  She is required to make videos for homework and it works perfect.,
"This doesn't come with much documentation, other than ""turn it on and set up Windows 10"", and it took me two days to get the touchscreen and the touch pad to work (become familiar with downloading and installing Synaptics drivers from the HP website).  Once I was able to get Windows to recognize the touch screen and pad, it runs pretty well and is a nice machine.  I was surprised to find that it came with a years subscription to Microsoft 365, so you get all the Office stuff right off the bat.",
it’s definitely light weight & my games work on it great. definitely worth the money.,
"First computer was defective, touch pad and screen did not work. There was no cursor. I sent it back. The replacement laptop works perfectly. Great screen, keyboard and fast. I upped the ram to 32 gigs. This a great bang for the buck. Any comparable computer was several hundred dollars more expensive than this one. I hope it gives me several years of untroubled use.  I have only had laptop for a few days, time will tell.",
It made a good gift for my teenage daughter. She draws all her artwork on the device. No more expensive portfolios.,
"Firstly, I don't want to spend a lot of money on it. This is exactly within my price range. It is good quality, has many functions, great buy.",
Item was delivered faster than normal.,
Quick Delivery. Product works great,
"This was precisely what I was looking for, and it hasn't let me down so far. Rapid start-up is super simple to set up.",
"Great, I arrived earlier than the specified time, protected well, the packaging was not damaged, and the product quality is excellent. Recommended.",
Excellent mid-range devices for entertainment and academic research.,
Love this new look. Take it everywhere!!,
"I bought it for my son and he really likes it. It is very suitable for his school needs, and we have not encountered any problems. I will buy it again!",
"This is really well made and great quality.I rely on it daily for my college assignments, It works smoothly and reliably. I'm would definitely buy it again if i need other one.",
"I bought this for my office PC, very simple to set up( Installing drivers was smooth for me) and has quick, smooth 4k desktop performance as well. Its capacity definitely exceeds my expectations but the greatest part is its size, with all the cables you need (HDMI 2.0, USBs, type C ports) it offers me not only a good performance but also portable convenience that I could easily carry around with me while I was traveling or had to work overtime at home.",
"Flawless, runs fast and reliable. What a great little mini pc!",
I couldn't make any of these NUCs boot.,
This PC is capable of streaming from one HDMI port and video o the other. What I really like is streaming on one side and surfing and downloading on the other.,
"Fast Delivery, excellent packing. The NUC12 is an awesome machine and the seller did not load any bloatware. I highly recommend both the product and the seller.",
"I bought this NUC12 i7 (running Windows 11 Pro) to replace my aging NUC5 i7 (running Windows 10 Pro). The upgrades (2x HDMI, 2x TB/USB4, USB3.2 Gen2, WIFI6, Intel 12th Gen i7) are a big plus compared to the NUC5. A 3 year warranty comes with the computer. So far, no issues. The (standard) shipping time was amazingly (2 days) fast! The NUC12 will be my new main computer moving forward.",
"This is a very nice computer in a very small form factor. The i7 is very capable.  I am able to use two Monitors and I added some expansion ports for additional USB and other connections.  The 520 Gb drive may be adequate for some purposes, but larger drives are expensive when purchased from Intel with the Computer.

I added a 2 Tb Crucial SSD for additional storage.  Very compact and capable. The drives are encrypted which means that you must use a backup program that can backup an encrypted drive.",
"Ordered and had NUC within 2 days.  Exactly what I ordered fully loaded 16GB RD + 512GB SSD WIN11.
Had an issue with Windows 11 boot record and thought it was maybe the SSD failure - contacted support via email on the sticker on the NUC and within 4 hours got a response with 3 options including replacing the SSD.  Resolved in less than 24 hours and up and running.  I'd order and have ordered more - recommend vendor to source NUCs from.",
"The computer  arrived on time and was well packaged. I purchased it to replace a 12-year-old i7 tower desktop. I immediately began to test its functionality: I partitioned the internal SSD to create a small disk for onboard files. Next, Updated the OS with version 22h2 and the latest BIOS with ease. Then,  I installed basic applications from my old i7. I added a 500 gb hdd and backed up the system. Next, I created a recovery DVD on my Blu-ray and made sure the computer would start from the recovery disk. Using a docking station, I was able to access both 1080p monitors through each usb-c  port. Naturally the 2 HDMI worked well also. I was even able to boot the computer using a 16gb usb 3.0 attached to the docking station. The computer had no issues recognizing the 8 TB external hard drive, DVD drive or usb jump-drive. The internal fan is quiet and  keeps the computer mildly warm.
I have purchased 2 Gen-10 NUC's previously and they have been very reliable. I am looking forward to experiencing the advances this NUC 12 Pro provides.
See Photos, attached.",
"Built an Ethereum validator with this unit. Initial concern, worried the item Nuc,12 I7 barebones unit wouldn’t come with power supply. Some sites sell without. I contacted the seller and got back to me asap! Assured me they only sell top notch no worries items, it came with the power supply.  Item was as described sealed new in package. Added  64g ram ,4tb sd running Ubuntu. This unit is rock solid no issues. Item came super fast shipping. I’m very happy with my purchase and would recommend this unit and seller to anyone.",
"From the headline, you can see you bought a 12th Intel Core i7-1260P, 32GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD.This computer has been great  for light gaming and web surfing, arrived quickly and worked straight out of the box!

Cathy in Geek+ tech support was excellent - answered some of my configuration questions immediately and provided some very helpful documentation.",
"I purchased this NUC12 Pro (32GB + 1TB) to use with a 50 inch Samsung 4K UHD TV.  I use this system to do CAD work (Fusion 360), circuit simulations, video editing and live OBS sessions with multiple cameras.  It works great.  I was previously using a Surface Studio, but it was having trouble keeping up with the video loads and did not play well with the monitor, though that could be the fault of the DisplayPort to HDMI adapter I was using.  The direct HDMI outputs of this NUC produce an excellent picture on the 4K monitor, even when viewing subtle shading changes that I could not easily see previously.

I received the NUC, plugged in a keyboard, mouse, network cable,  and the 4K monitor and fired it up.  After a few minutes of updating Windows 11 to the current release level I was able to load in my software and get going.  I have had no problems whatsoever in loading lots of software and data and running multiple compute-intensive programs simultaneously.",
"I purchased this little fast Nuc and I absolutely love it! Not only did I receive an amazing computer but I also received the most amazing customer service from Cathy, who made sure I knew exactly when my computer arrived, and was reminded the day it arrived, even though it was a Saturnday :)

A really cool thing about this NUC is that it is so small that I can fit it in my handbag when I travel to Denmark to visit my parents or go on a cabin trip with my kids so they can ski and I can work from ""home"". It's perfect for me and I  have had no problems whatsoever with this little cute computer (fist time I have considered a computer to be cute Lol).

Thank you Cathy! I will most definitely shop with you again! :)",
"Doesnt do anything.  Power button does nothing.  There are no instructions, at all.  I am not even sure if there is a power lite or anything to confirm it has power.  Amazon ""product support"" is useless.  After about 5 minutes on hold, they offered to dial intel for me.  I TRIED ANOTHER POWER ADAPTER, BUT STILL NOTHING.  I HAVE SEND BACK VIA UPS, AND NOW I HAVE ~$700 ""IN THE WIND"" FOR A MONTH OR TWO; UNTIL AMAZON ACTUALLY REFUNDS ME.  This was supposed to be ""like new"", but the box was damaged and it was clearly sent back as non-functional.  Simply, NOT GOOD, at all.  I feel cheated, am I am, until I get my refund.  After that is just the waste of my time dealing with Amazon Warehouse.",
"Runs fast, I am using this for video conferencing and it is a wonderful machine!!",
"I initially had some issues with a hardwired LAN connection not working but it magically seemed to resolve itself within the first week and never had an issue since. I'm running Linux on this machine and it's been great. I'm not overloading the machine and it works well without a fan.

FYI. There is a top cover and there’s nothing wrong with it but I have it removed for the pictures for no good reason.",
The product is actually very good and mini PC is amazingly powerful. The compact size is making it even more attractive,
"I've been using this as my primary desktop computer for a little over six years.  I probably use is it for 20 hours/week or more.  It won't play modern games but it plays Starcraft like there's no tomorrow.

The purpose of this review is to point out that durability.  It stopped turning on about a week ago.  I replaced the CMOS battery, and I'm back online.  You can't ask for better than that.  (The unit wouldn't boot, no POST, nothing, until the battery was replaced.)  I'm not usually that big a fan of Intel branded products, but this one has just been outstanding.",
"Excellent machine, good permanence and small size.",
Really good. Thanks a lot. :),
works well,
I like everything that apple did. These NUCs are great little computers.,
"Simple, fast, small, and dead silent.  This box is great and does what it says on the box.",
Running Debian 9 on this. No issues. Love these NUCs.,
I just love it. It is much better than I expected. I've installed ESXi 6 on it and it is amazingly fast.,
"This product has an incorrect description
and when you buy it I did not come with the decribed
I bought 4 units and came without disk or memory
although its description says 16 ram and 128 disk.
for this reason I have lost money and time",
"This has been an excellent unit and very cost effective.  We are starting to move in this direction any time we need to replace a machine.  We mount it to the back of the monitor to clear up desk space.  This is perfect for help desk, sales, and accounting type departments.",
This replaced a desktop. What a great choice! Only problem I had was with attached USB hubs. Attached USB hubs will occasionally keep the device from booting. Once disconnected - all is OK. I just reconnect after bootup. Still worth 5 stars.,
"I am building this a local VFW.  They will not be stressing the CPU, so I went with the i3.  So far the operating system(Win10) has loaded flawlessly.  I had to update the Video, USB and network drivers from the Windows default.  Overall I would purchase this again.",
"Works Ok. I found that you cannot successfully install Windows Server 2016 without workarounds for the networking, which isn't cool, but I did get around it. In there defence, Then do not state support for Windows 10/Server 2016. That really is a shame.",
"Intel's AMT was confusing to set up at first due to a lack of clear instructions anywhere.

Bought what I thought was the correct wifi module but turned out not to be compatible.

Performed well, VESA mount was effective. Easy to assemble.",
"Compact and Speedy.  With 16GB RAM and 240GB SSD, this is a perfect knowledge worker machine.  For a power user the lower core count and clock speed might not be ideal, but for a VSA mountable task PC, it is hard to beat. This model has vPro, so AMT allows full remote manageability and remote KVM!  Had to go this Gen 5 version as the Gen6 does not have a vPro enabled (""M"") version yet AFAIK.  Hightly recommended.",
"This is the 4rd NUC model I have purchased for the university I work at (the other models being the NUC5i3RYH, NUC5i5RYH, and NUC6i5SYH) and it has been a charm to work with. I ordered 14 these to update a teaching lab. I chose this model mainly due to cost but also because of availability. I would have rather purchased a model with a full-sized HDMI port on the back but I wanted at least a NUC5i3 model, and the NUC6i3 models are too expensive and seem to be having some reliability issues.

Each of the 14 I ordered was equipped with 8GB of Crucial DDR3L memory and a Samsung EVO 2.5in ssd (the M.2 version simply cost too much), and then attached to the rear of a 24in monitor. The end result is a very nice package that I am hopeful will last 5-7 years.

One wish: That I could have found a 6-12in length HDMI-to-miniDP cable. The shortest I could find was 3ft and that simply clutters up the back of the monitor/NUC combo.",
"I'm very happy with the performance of this PC. Granted I don't play games, but it handles all the graphic design multitasking I do like a champ. I run dual monitors at 1920 x 1200 without any issue. It is configured with a Samsung 850 EVO 250GB Sata III SSD and 2 x 8GB Crucial Balistic Sport DDR3 RAM. You will need 2 micro DP to DP to hook up the monitors and also this is something to note, you will need a USB 2.0 extender if you plan on using a bluetooth mouse directly into the PC. I contacted Intel on this one, for some reason the USB 3.0 ports are not shielded and create interference with bluetooth dongle. The extender just places the dongle at a distance far enough away so that the EMF of the port doesn't interfere. Another way around this is to connect the dongle into your monitor and run a USB out from the monitor into the PC.",
"Nice little device that cleanly replaces a traditional bulky and noisy mini-tower computer. I chose this particular NUC5I5MYHE model specifically because of the dual Mini Display Ports as all my computers have a dual 19"" 4:3 monitor configuration.

In addition to the base NUC unit, I purchased the Crucial 8Gb RAM kit (4GBx2 DDR3 1600 MT/s PC3 - 12800 CL11 SODIMM CT2KIT51264BF160B), a Samsung SSD (Samsung 850 EVO 250 GB M.2 MZ-N5E250BW) and Bluetooth/WiFi combo module (Intel 7265). Installation of these components wasn't difficult, especially if you have smaller hands. The one problem I ran into was that the units antenna wires that connect to the BT/WiFI 7265 module kept popping off due to their rigidity and routing within the enclosure.

All said and done, the hardware (NUC+RAM+SSD+BT-WiFi module) cost $584 dollars (plus OS software of your choice) -- that isn't any less costly than a traditional desktop (mini tower) computer, so you should only consider the NUC if you're looking for small form factor and quiet operation.

I chose to install Windows 7 64-bit. On the OS/software side, the only problem I encountered was that the Bluetooth driver and software stack wouldn't work properly with my Apple bluetooth keyboard and/or Microsoft bluetooth mouse -- not until I upgraded the BIOS. On a side note, finding the proper drivers and BIOS file are a bit of a pain with Intel's site -- Intel could really benefit by learning from other tech giants when it comes to implementing a simplified ""enter your device's model number or serial number and here are all the drivers and files you need"" approach.

On the plus side, the unit runs cool, quiet and the Intel i5 is fast enough for the non-gamer applications I use on a daily basis.

I do have a few criticisms of the hardware design:

The first and biggest concern of the device's design is that there aren't enough USB ports. There are only two on the back and two on the front. I'd like to see at least four on the back for keyboard, mouse, scanner and cable to feed my monitor's integrated USB hub. The two ports on the front would then be sufficient for the occasional use of my external DVD and memory card reader.

Speaking of memory card reader, I've seen others post that it would be real nice to have a SD card slot integrated into the unit. I see this as a really nice to have, but not a need to have. For the $1.50 it would cost in parts, it would be nice to see it built in to future NUC units.

Also, why Intel located the audio output jack on the front of the unit doesn't make a lot of sense to me. Why isn't this on the back like a normal computer so that I can route and hide all my cables?

Lastly, the design of the power supply leaves a bit to be desired. The connector to the NUC is not locking, and for reason's unknown, the barrel connector is a right angle which doesn't make a lot of sense given that all other cables (USB, Enternet, display ports) exit straight out the back. More importantly, the 'brick' plugs directly to your outlet, rather than with a lead cable -- for me this was also a problem as my power strip will no longer fit under my desk with the NUC's power brick attached.

All-in-all, I'd buy one again and would recommend these to peers -- but I'd make sure the limitations outlined above wouldn't be a problem first.",
"A bunch of functionality of this device doesn't work properly (UEFI firmware compatibility with supposedly compatible Windows OSes, TPM 2.0 support/integration, etc...) doesn't function properly and Intel hasn't addressed it during the time the product has been on the market.  Intel's support continues to be the slow ""we'll-get-back-to-you-in-a-few-days"" nightmare that has sent my unit out of Amazon's return policy and into the land of being a desk decoration.  I've spent far more time working with various support experts trying to get this thing to work to the point where ten of these wouldn't be worth the time I've spent on it.  Good luck, buyers.",
"I've had this about two months, and liked it so much I bought a second one. I put 16GB of stock Crucial RAM, a HyperX Savage 240GB SSD, and an Intel 7260N wireless NIC into it.  The only problem I had was finding the antenna wires for the wireless NIC, but they were there.  The unit is nearly silent.  It's quick enough for all day to day desktop functionality but it's clearly not a gaming machine (although it runs older games without a hitch).  The video is faultless under normal load.  I used Rufus to build a Win7 install USB stick, and installation of Win7 took a few minutes and was problem-free.  I downloaded the current drivers from Intel's site and had no problems with any of them.
This has become my day-to-day default machine, and sits on top of the 6700K/32GB machine I had been using daily.",
"Pricey, but performs *very* well, and can handle 16GB of RAM and an SSD.  Mine's hooked up to a 4K TV and a pair of 24"" 1920x1200 monitors (with VGA to USB3 adapters) and I use it to remote into other systems.  Quiet, takes up no room, and doesn't generate any appreciable amount of heat, which helps in a small office that gets hot in the summer.",
"These little machines are amazing. I've purchased two dozen of various NUC models over the last 6 months because they are small, light, easy to pick up and move to a different desk if needed, and most of all they are incredibly powerful!

This particular model is a 5th generation i3 processor by Intel. I have 16GB of DDR3 RAM and a Samsung EVO 850 250GB M.2 SSD with it. I can't believe how fast this thing performs. I use it with PhotoShop, ConnectWise (line of business application), MS Office 2016, Windows 10, and Chrome browser. I will quite often have all of these apps up and running simultaneously with 15+ tabs open in Chrome. It never misses a beat.

If you want a tiny desktop computer, build yourself a NUC.",
"Surprisingly when I opened up the bottom cover my NUC had been fitted with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB M.2 SATA hard drive. I purchased the NUC 5 Pro series as a bare bones PC. Normally this means I would need to add Storage and memory (RAM). The options for storage M.2 SATA (B key) socket and a standard SATA socket and space for 2.5"" SSD.  I messaged the company because I felt it was the right thing to do and offered to exchange it for what I had payed for. They emailed me back and thanked me for letting them know but told me I could keep it. So I purchased a used barebones NUC 5 Pro for $175 and ended up getting a well built complete system. The new price without the RAM and storage is $499. You add in the price of buying the RAM and memory which that's another $130. So yes I am very happy.  The product it's self  didn't look used it came with the peel off plastic protection on top and the front buttons. There where no scratches or marks of any kind and the it operates well. The only thing I would like to see included is a mini DisplayPort cable or adapter. That is the only outputs. I ended up purchasing  a mini DisplayPort to HDMI adapter from the local Best Buy  for about $9 just so I could get it up and running and test it. Otherwise I have no complaints. Of course I thrilled that I got more than I ordered but the product itself is like new and does what it's supposed to do. It cam with the power cord and metal mounting bracket, as well as all the original paperwork that would come in a new boxed item. Then when I contacted the sellers they were quick to respond and seemed very kind. What more could someone ask for. I would have written the same kind of review if I had gotten just the product as I had ordered it because of it's quality.",
"I took a video of the unboxing, I purchased this gaming computer on may 4... I am very happy, I received everything presented to me, but I'm a bit disappointed, since two of the RGB lights are not working on the computer. I have looked up several YouTube videos on how to turn them on, and wondered if it might have been, just a wiring error and to my disappoint no.. Minor not major overall I am happy with the pc.",
"I'm a retired computer engineer, but it doesn't take one to see their design is flawed and their science is wrong. Look at the photo I posted of theirs. The back fan is the only one I can tell is correctly setup.
1) your front 3 case find should ALWAYS be setup facing inward. Meaning they are all blowing fresh cool air into your case and over your motherboard and components.

2) if you can, ALWAYS, mount your AIO liquid cooler radiator on the top of your case. (And here is where they messed up, they aren't creating a negative or positive pressure system, air will just find its way out of any tiny openeings) the way this is set up you will need your fans running at 100% just to fight against each other.
After mounting your radiator to the ceiling you then mount your 3 fans for a 360mm so that the fans are blowing air through the radiator and out the top.
3) Doing it this way cool air will.be brought into your case from the front 3 fans,, as the air passed over your motherboard and videocard its going to begin to warm up as it cools down your components. What does warm air do naturally? Warn air rises. Which is why you have your radiator fans set to pull that warm air up and through the radiator cooling the radiator down and then it's really gonna be warm air. Do you want that hot air being sucked into your case and blown over your motherboard? NO, that one exhaust fan in the back will have to work on 100% just like all the others as the fans fight each other against air pressure and gravity.

It's very simple when building a PC. Hot air always rises. Your radiator is going to get warm but not scalding hot. But you don't want any of the hot air from your radiator going back into your case, do you? I'd you do just get rid of the water cooler and put a fan on your cpu and let it blow hot air all over everything.
The warm air coming off the radiator will rise out the tip of your case on its own. That's why you attatch 3 fans to the bottom of it and have the fans blowing air UP not DOWN like these people have it doing.

The 3 fans will pull any air in your case that's warm and push it through your radiator and out the top of your case. The rear case fan is to help blow any left over warm air out of the case as well and to help pull the air blown in from your front fans right towards rhe radiator fans as it warms up when it cools your ram etc. Whatever warm air doesn't get blown out the top of your case will exhaust out the rear of your case.
That's how you set up proper cooling for your gaming pc.",
"Overall, I’m fairly happy with this build. Got it on sale during cyber money for $1500, which is a great deal for the components provided. For the normal price of $1900, I would consider it a little over priced. But, my biggest issue (and why I can’t rate it higher), is the fact that you cannot change or customer the RGB! It sounds minor, but when its filling your office with light, being able to dim or edit the color pattern to irritate your eyes a little less would be nice.",
"Just bought this.  Seems like a nice box.

Two issues:
First, it would have been nice to place stickers over legacy ports (Video) which don't work.  It's fine they don't work (use the graphics cards ports instead) but setup would have been easier without having to go through all the docs.

Second, their web site has no downloads available for this model.  Just a spec sheet.  Had to contact support to get a link for the correct version of Firestorm (Graphics card configuration/monitoring software) and then I had to grab an MSI app from Windows Store for LED control.  Would have been better to have all this info in one place.",
"I’ve had this computer for about 2 months. So far, I haven’t run into a single issue.

Gets 150+ frames at 1080 on pretty much any game. I mostly game at 1080 & 1440 and have been seriously impressed with the performance.",
"Excellent. The MEK Hero G1 A5837 met or exceeded my expectations. First it was well packed, with a large foam insert protecting the graphics card so it didn't get banged around during shipping. It started right up. Windows said it wasn't activated and it wasn't obvious how to do that, so a quick email to support resulted in a fast reply giving me the command to find the Windows product key which worked with activation.

The keys to a gaming machine are making sure it doesn't overheat but that cooling it doesn't generate a ton of fan noise. The Mek has eight fans in it - three at the front, one at the back, as well as two on the graphics card and two on the CPU liquid cooler. I've monitored temperatures during gameplay and GPU and all CPU cores run cool, maxing out at no more than 70C. The fans are relatively quiet and not noticeable above the usual volume of gameplay. So excellent cooling with low noise.

For expansion there are two open DIMM slots and two open PCIE slots, although one of them would put a PCIE card very close to the graphics card fan so it may not be the best choice.

The only minor con I've noticed is although there are a ton of USB ports, there is no USB C. This is a nit because USB A to C cables are readily available. Also it would be possible to add a cheap PCIE USB C card if necessary.

In summary I'm delighted with the Mek, and my one minor interaction with their support team was positive.",
"So far so good with this machine. I've been running it for several weeks now. Its very quiet, and doesn't run hot. The case was in good shape. The VGA connector on the back was bent, but I don't use that anyway. The included Bluetooth fab and WiFi fab, both worked as soon as I plugged them in - as they are not on the mb. I added a 4 port network card after buying this box and it didn't work as expected in the PCIe 1x (small)slot. When I uninstalled it, and plugged it into the PCIe x16 slot, it worked right away. There are no more slots available however - those two were the only ones on the mb and I'm not sure the small one even works. Thus 4 stars.",
the dell optiplex 5050 is a fast compact pc with windows 10,
"not as speed as mentioned. I do know whose mistake is that, my screen has some marks on it. I can see them clearly  when lappy is off.",
Works great especially for the price. Would definitely recommend for anyone looking for a good home / office starter.,
It took 3 times to get the correct one I ordered but we got it and it functions great.,
"I bought this computer last fall to run a little home business. I haven't used it a lot, but I'm having trouble with it already. My latest trouble is that it sometimes cuts off and on at random and I never know when I will be able to use it or not. I plan to get a computer tech to look at it. I have an older IBM laptop that I bought reconditioned for $175 years ago, and I have never had any trouble with it.",
I received the laptop within a couple days of ordering (speedy delivery). I was able to fire it up and began using it within minutes. It's very fast &  I really like the touch screen. The display is very sharp and clear.  I'm very happy with this laptop.,
"the screen touch, working deficiency",
"Less than 3 months after purchasing this laptop it stops recognizing the AC adapter, so now I can't charge my laptop. This laptop has a nice bright screen, however it is difficult to click on anything because the touch pad is super sensitive. You may find yourself clicking on several things accidentally apart from getting frustrated at the touch pad's terrible navigation. If you still intend to buy this laptop, it may be in your best interest to also purchase an external mouse and an extended warranty. Good luck.",
System came upgraded to Win 10 from Win 8! Both the audio and video drivers were incompatible and unusable. Also the recovery partition was unusable. I believe the system was also infected with viruses. I am highly disappointed with the product and the vendor. I requested a return 3 days ago and UPS has yet to show up...,
This laptop is giving me lot of trouble.it is not showing up the task bar every time when on my laptop.and the search button is working most of the times. and whenever i use brightness button to increase my brightness my screen will go off again i need to go nd press the power again to restart  i did not like this laptop its very heavy to carry as well.As it giving lot of troubles and it is testing my patience  I want to return this laptop.,
"maybe the single worst thing I have ever purchased .Warranty is only 30 days , on the 31st day it began tomfreeze up shut off and reboot . Dell told me it was the software which ""they ""put in the computer . I likened it to buying a car,  the motor blows uo and they tell me the oil was bad and the motors  not their responsibility . Dell concierge was my only option sans throwing it in the garbage . More wasted money . 6 ,7 different attempts and they still cant fix it .",
"Just bought a $349 Acer to replace this $499 paperweight.  Wicked slow.  All of a sudden dvd/cd drive is ""not connected.""  USB ports have been jankey since day one, doesn't recognize stuff arbitrarily that my old seven-year old Acer never had a problem with. Never used the touchscreen.  Didn't think I would but it didn't cost extra.  Why would anyone use a touchscreen laptop?  Anyhow, going to chuck this piece of junk into the river behind my house when the new Acer arrives.  (Just kidding.  I don't pollute.)",
I loved this computer. However after a year and a half of lite use it started acting up. For a few months it wouldn't always turn on. I had to do a lot of playing around with it. Then it just wouldn't turn on at all. I had someone look at it and he ended up trying to take the hard drive out and he said it was  wiped clean. Nothing on it at all. He said it is basically a paper weight.,
"Item arrived on time and in its original package. The seller's description of the laptop is accurate, and the laptop looks fantastic.",
Amazing.i wasnt expecting my package to arrived before christmas.but it did arrived early.over all performance on Dell was so great and i was satisfied.,
"This laptop is exactly as advertised and I'm glad about that. Only thing is the advertised ""pocket sleeve"" did not come with the laptop.",
"The paneling breaks incredibly easy (something Dell admits). Additionally, if your charge breaks, good luck finding another charger for it. It won't recognize any other charger except the default one (even OEM chargers that work with basically every other dell laptop). If you want a new charger, the only place is to get it from Dell for like $80.00.",
This was a gift for our son for school. Very intuitive to use and the set up was very easy. The screen is nice and clear with good pixelation. The computer is fast and responsive and does everything he needs. I wish it came with Microsoft Office but it seems they are all going away from the included software.,
Performs pretty good for most of my needs.  I have a couple of applications that an i7 processor would have been better,
Computer was fast but it would not hold a charge. It had to remain plugged in the entire time it was on. Sent itback for a full refund. Sellers were very polite and remedied the issue without complaint.,
"I love this laptop.  It has the power to do what I need it to, and it does it flawlessly.  This thing runs better than my friend's $700 laptop.  I am so glad I made the decision to go with this.  Believe it or not, my cart was filled with different choices that I narrowed down to this.",
"This PC replaced a dead HP-G72 and has been a pleasant surprise.  I've never been a fan of Dell but, my experience with this laptop has been very good.  I've been using it a great deal during this first month & a half.  Aside from the usual windows updates and reinstalling my software, there have been no Dell related issues.",
"Not impressed. My son saved his money for a laptop and after much deliberation decided on this one. He's had it just over two months and already it won't charge. Spent 53 minutes on the phone with a hard to understand rep only to have them send us a new charger. New charger arrives and not only does it not fix the problem, now the computer won't even turn on.  Looks like I'll be wasting more of my time on the phone again. Next time we will be purchasing another brand, most likely saving for an Apple. We hadn't purchased a Dell in about ten years and now I'm remembering why!!",
"battery issues after less than 9 months... computer doesnt charge anymore.
kinks in the sense of the light button use puts computer to sleep.

not sure I can recommend it.
but it runs fast and the screen is nice.",
A great computer at a great price. My only complaint is that I am not used to the keys yet and the touch pad is way too sensitive.,
"Let me start of by saying that the package was delivered on time; no issues there. Also, no issues so far with the supplier. The issue is from the computer itself. After only two weeks of ownership, suddenly the monitor screen just goes black; it does come back on after I move the screen. I'm reaching out to Dell for assistance however if it cannot be resolved, I'm sending it back.",
"POS stay away this thing has been nothing but a problem, black screen of death within the first month , should have sent it back but no ... figured it was just a fluke, 8 months later the touch screen started acting up, 4 hrs on phone with dell they say virus,  hardware , all kinds of excuses , total reboot lose all your info nothing any better throw it in the corner 3 months later before warranty goes out here I am 3 hrs on phone again, they (DELL) are bouncing all over the place try to get this resolved, on hold etc....... computer still acting up , no good answers. never again total waste of money",
"I'm an apple person, but this computer look nice for a good price. I've being using it for college and is perfect. The battery runs out a lit too fast tho.",
"I've had this laptop for a little over a month and I am not disappoint works great, never owned a Dell this is much more than I had expected very satisfied",
"Hard to get it going.  Hard to get Japanese installed.  But after a computer guy worked on it and I spent $100, all became well. It's now a good little computer.",
Started my laptop up for the first time this weekend.  Windows 10 was NOT pre-installed as advertised!  I am now on day 3 of downloading and installing the operating system (my data usage cap caused a slow down).  If I had known I would have to install the operating system I would have done things differently.  Very disappointed.  I may be returning this if I have any other performance issues.  We'll see after I get a chance to actually use it!,
"Absolutely fantastic. Very fast. The 1080p touchscreen looks great. The design is pretty nice. The area around the keyboard is a rubber material which makes it comfortable to type on. Its a big laptop but still comfortable to use. Battery life is average not the best, that's my only gripe. But for $500 you can't get any other computer that comes with an Intel i5, 1080p touchscreen, backlit keyboard and and CD drive.",
"I have had this for only a week, but so far so good. This laptop is definitely worth the price for it's clarity on graphics and large storage capacity of 930GB- about 1tb.
I personally had two negative opinions on the laptop:
1) The touch pad wasn't to my liking- there was touch sensor on the buttons of the touch pad
2) Although graphics were on top specs, some colors were dull",
"This is a very neat looking computer. I love the touch screen, as well as the backlit keyboard. Graphics are above average, and the sound is as well. Would prefer to give it a 4.5",
"This has been the biggest POS I've ever owned or heard about. If 0 stars were an option that's what I'd give. At month 3 the hard drive failed, at month 4 the battery failed, now at month 6 either the charging port or motherboard is bad and I have to send it in for repair. I would have gladly spent 3 times the money for something that would last. Strangely enough, I'm writing this review on a 10 Y/O Gateway laptop that has been through hell and never had a single failure, still on the original battery, hard drive, charger and charging port BTW. Customer service is a joke, barely speak English and troubleshoot from a piece of paper. Will NEVER buy another dell product and wouldn't own another if it was given to me.",
I Love Love Love this laptop. When my sister saw mine over the Christmas holiday she had to have one. I got one for her. I use a PC in my studio and I have this laptop at home and am able to do a lot of the things at home I used to have to stay late to finish. It's perfect. Because my field is in art the resolution was important to me and this screen is beautiful.,
"Outstanding value - not the fastest and not the best gamer,  but great for real life use - work or home. Everything worked right out of the box. Dell did a complete job on this one. Having the DVD and media drives adds to the versatility. The touch screen and back light keyboard add to great ergonomics. It even has a usable palm rest. The High Def screen is outstanding. It is an excellent platform for Windows 10.",
An absolute garbage did not even last five months when I got a message that it was not reading the charger so I’m bought a new charger the same thing contact the seller they would do nothing so I took it to Best Buy’s and they want it to repair it for as much as I have paid for it so now I’m looking to spend another five hundred plus dollars on another laptop for sure is not going to be a Dell .Im very disappointed with the manufacturers Dell for designing something this bad and also with the seller and with Amazon for letting this people ruin their reputation,
"I was worried that my daughter wouldn't use this laptop because I found out after I purchased it that her Dad got her a Macbook. I thought worth the apple product being so portable and popular that my gift would go by the wayside. I'm pleased that going on two months later she uses it all the time. This was a good deal. She loves the touchscreen and backlit keyboard, it has plenty of memory and is plenty fast.",
This has been a sweet machine so far.  My only complaint is the constant requests for friver updates at a price.  Haven't even had the thing for 6 months and they are already begging  for additional charges.,
"I'm going to try and return it...the color on the screen is off, the gray color is way off! I cannot change the gray ribbons and GUI of this WIN 10 machine. I have tried the re-calibrate to no avail Waiting on reply from Seller. There is also back light bleed.",
"This laptop is perfect for those of you looking for a quicker laptop to do more than the average joe without having to spend the extra money. Some other dell versions do not have the optical drive included, or the higher resolution that this laptop has. I have downloaded multiple software's on this computer already, including engineering software, antivirus, Microsoft offices and the speed of the computer is still great. Lots of storage and great RAM capacity for the price. Highly recommend.",
"Had this laptop for 3 1/2 months, the power adapter stopped working. Called Del Support, got someone in India that really didn't know what to do, they e-mailed me a fedx label to sent it to Houston. Amazon showed it out of warranty after 3 1/2 months, so I'm just going to use it without sending it in with all my data on it. I've very dissatisfied with this laptop. It's a piece of junk in my opinion. The keyboard was seemingly cheaply built. Seemed more like a child's toy.  I""m a retired Network Engineer and know a little about computers. If you buy this one, just remember, I you were warned.  Waste of good money...Buying a different brand and chalk this up as an expensive well learned.  BTW, I'm close to 75 yrs young and this is not a revenge review.  Good luck to all that may get to read this review...",
"The look is a little outdated, was expecting a nicer looking laptop. Love the touchscreen feature even if I don't use it all the time. My keyboard is a bit bowed in one area but works fine. No problems so far. I wish scrolling up and down using keypad was better, glad I can change the sensitivity.",
I have had this laptop for less than a year and loved it at first but it has started restarting randomly while I use it. It started doing this after about 8 months of use. I've looked up ways to fix this problem but nothing has worked. Any diagnostic I've had done shows no issues. This laptop is basically useless to me now until I can afford to get it fixed...if it is even fixable. A laptop ceasing to work properly after less than a year doesn't give me much comfort though so I may end up purchasing a new one and not a Dell.,
I contacted seller in regards to battery not charging. I never received a response. Disappointing.,
Upgrade the ram to max (16 gig) and you have a real fast unit.,
"I'm not a huge fan of this laptop. Not really  for any reason other than I don't like the windows 10.  I think it is  probably okay, but I continue to use my older laptop as it is more user friendly then this one. The kids use it for school work and such without much of a problem.",
"I bought the laptop 8 months ago. It has never left my desk, been dropped, taken outside the house, or experienced any kind of damage. 1 month in to owning this laptop, i noticed each time i opened and closed the laptop the left hinge would make a clicking sound. I thought that was normal and nothing to worry about. 6 months later, when i went to close the laptop, and instead of the hinge bending, all pressure was put onto the screen and it bent the screen causing the moniter to split in half. Now i have to pay dell money to get it repaired.",
"This worked great for about a year. about 4 months ago i started having issues with the touchscreen,it would randomly flash little circles on the screen and open items I had pinned to the tray.The screen would flash multiple colors .I took it to a friend who works on Computers and he said Dell is noted for having touchscreen issues and refuses to do anything about it.As of right now there are no touchscreen drivers installed -they vanished into cyber space i guess.The DVD is the noisiest i have ever used. All systems are backed up and i await the day of failure.",
"Have been using a MacBook Pro for years but had to get a Windows Computer for use at work. I was hesitant but had no choice so I stepped up and took the plunge.

The Dell has been great, is it a model behind who knows by the time I finish typing this review it will be 2 or 3 models behind, but it works like a champ for me.

Fast, plenty of storage and 3 months in of a lot is use and 0/zero crashes.",
"Great laptop for the value. It is a tad bit slow out the gate which threw me off considering I haven't purchased a laptop in years and my MacBook Pro from six years ago was speedier, but then again that came at a different price point.",
"Just received it. This is my first laptop I have only had desktops before. It seems to be good quality and is very quiet.
I love the lighted keyboard. I will have wait and see how it lasts, but very satisfied with it. Can't beat it for the money.",
It claims that the battery to last 7 hours which lasts only 3 hours. I am disappointed as its a first laptop i brought after lots of Analyses.,
"It seems this laptop has a checkered review grid.The only thing I can say is that I bought it almost 3 years ago  and aside form a minor driver problem (fixed on the phone via Dell C.S) it has worked without a glitch.The screen is HD and briiliantly sharp . The system is fast ,the keyboard lights up with a touch and the sound is loud.For me,its as good as it gets.",
"purchased after much comparative research.  took a chance on Windows 10 and a touch screen (not a desired feature, but only touch screen models had other features.  despite Prime membership, shipping took a week (the average quality, Amazon branded carrying case arrived in two days. the unit is a replacement for a notebook with low RAM; it definitely out-performs the notebook.  got what I paid for and that is OK.",
"Love it!  And thanks so much to all the reviewers here who persuaded me to buy it.
It's very fast, it's quiet, the display is nice, it came with no crapware installed. The backlit keyboard is wonderful. This laptop is exactly what I wanted.  And what a great price!
My wife has a much more expensive Dell with a metal case, 4K display, SDD and faster processor.  It's not as fast or as smooth as this one.  I don't know what Dell did on this model, but it's a winner.",
Great price for the power and features.  There is only one problem.  The power cord connection is not the same as generations of Dell computers.  The the power cords I have all over the house and office won't fit.  So I have to take this power cord with me everywhere.  I work on spreadsheets continually.  The big screen is worth it.,
"Excellent Laptop for the price. Backlit keyboard, touchscreen, etc. Everything is as stated. Windows 10 is beautiful. I do a lot of everyday tasks on this laptop and it is fully capable of such. Im not sure how it will work for those who perform designs and the higher end stuff but its great for school work and my job.",
"Not reliable. Very slow when an update is waiting to be installed. Easy to work on and replace parts but constantly needs repair. Not a fan of Dell products and quite disappointed in this one. The old saying ""You get what you pay for"" is very true. While these are inexpensive given the specs, they are easily outperformed by my other laptops with half the RAM/HDD and graphics capabilities. Will not buy another Dell.",
"Here's the deal, i got this yesterday. I loved it. The screen resolution is great, the speakers are great, it's sleek looking, etc. However, last night the screen completely went black and stopped working. I believe a got a defective product so I will be getting a refund. However, it does seem like a great product, except it seems to be a fairly common problem (if you look at the one star reviews) for it to come only to have some aspect of the display malfunction. Just keep that in mind before purchasing.",
"I upgraded from a very old machine that was struggling to run Lightroom and various photo editing programs. I decided on this model because it had the power, memory, and resolution for a decent price.

It is a great fit. The pictures look great and editing is fast for 16 and 12 MP RAW images.

There are a few annoyances. The touchscreen is pretty useless, this is not a 2-in-1. You can barely reach it. It gets greasy quickly, much faster than my iPad. The keyboard is yet another key layout different from every other, such a pain.

Overall I am enjoying and it gets the job done.",
"All in all the computer performs well but for how long is anybody's guess. When I received the product it would not turn on, in addition no user manuals are provided.  I had to log onto my desk top to try and figure out what was wrong with it, after being on the phone with Dell support for about an hour and searching for trouble code beeps on my desk top it was determined the memory cards were not seated properly.  Dell was helpful in walking me through removing the back cover of the lap top and re-seating the memory chips, I had to do it twice but then the computer started to function.  Needless to say I was less than enamored having to go through all that.  I found it unbelievable the a new computer would have no user guide and I am far what one would consider tech savvy, so I really feel sorry for individuals that receive this product in this condition because you shouldn't have to take your new computer apart before you can start using it. In addition the computer just does not seem to be put together solid at all.",
"I am pleasantly surprised at how much I like this laptop. Although I don't care too much for Windows 10, I am adapting. The only problem I have is the HDMI, it doesn't automatically connect to my sound system and have to have a friend try to configure it because I hate having to search for a solution online. I suppose I will attribute that to win10 otherwise highly recommend this laptop",
It was a fairly good computer overall but it didn't last more than a year. I think the CPU died. I can see the screen when I hook it up to HDMI but it beeps loudly all the time and its basically useless at this point. I would honestly recommend finding another computer.,
"Unfortunately I was one of the customers who received a faulty product. I took it out of the box, set it up on my desk and turned it on. It worked fine for about an hour or so, until I tilted the screen. There must be some bad connections on the screen and it would only work at a certain angle, otherwise I had a bunch of lines and bars on the screen making it completely unusable. I did send it back and got a full refund tho, so that is appreciated. Also, for the very short period that the laptop actually was functional, it does seem like a really nice computer for the money, granted you get one that actually works. After this experience, I think I will just spend a little more to get a better quality laptop, but I will stick with Dell, I love their design.",
"Hard to fault this machine.  The display is excellent, keyboard feel is right & is quiet, and we have no disc chatter or fan noise.  I suspect it would not be ideal for hard core gaming, but for typical home use and word processing / spreadsheet work, it's just fine.  Installed the Office 2016 suite without issues.  Having very little bloatware to clean up & uninstall was a plus.  We use the touch screen a bit, and it operates as it should.  Once the keyboard is touched, the back light begins to operate, but it will turn off as a power saving measure after a period of inactivity.

Bottom line: met our expectations and then some.",
"I bought this laptop almost a year ago (February 2016) and it was great for a while. I don't abuse my electronics, in fact I used this maybe 2-3 times a week tops so it didn't get very heavy use at all. About 6 months in, I noticed a white line on the screen, similar to what you'd see if there was moisture damage. I only ever used this at home either in my bedroom or my living room, it was never near any source of moisture, and when I wasn't using it I kept it in a laptop case. It wasn't a huge issue since it didn't interfere with my usage of the laptop, but sill annoying. Now fast forward to about two weeks ago, when suddenly I get a message that the charger is plugged in, but not charging the laptop. Also the charger cable seemed a little loose, so I just assumed it was the charger going prematurely bad. I bought another charger, and to my disappointment got the same message, so it's obviously the laptop itself. I'm very disappointed that this thing lasted less than a year of less than moderate use. I have always loved Dell products, but this one was a major dud. What a waste of $400 :(",
I have been using it for a couple of months now. Got used to windows 10 only now. It has been ok. But the biggest thing I hate is the battery life. My battery lasts barely an hour or so. The charger I got with it is tiny and only 9V. We have other dell laptop chargers at home but they don't fit in this one. No wonder because they are bigger with higher voltage. Overall not bad but now I have to find a second charger for this and I am not ready to pay the extra $$$. Anyone has any suggestions?,
"I had this laptop for just over a month when I selected the start menu and received a ""Critical error"".  I called Dell support who tried several things and told me I had to reset my laptop back to the original settings losing everything.
I called the next day and was told again by another Dell support person they could do nothing.
I could however pay an additional fee to save all of my settings and files.  I chose to reset my laptop. What I am concerned about, if this is going to happen again.  I was past my 30 day warranty and could not return the laptop.",
"Great for business, not for gaming. My son was disappointed he couldn't play his video games on it, like his previous laptop.  My fault, I didn't realize the graphic card he asked for was essential.  But its great for student and business applications and surfing web. Wish I could of exchanged it.  But I bought it on sale in November for Christmas and the 30 days had expired by the time we figured out it was not suitable.  Live and Learn.",
"Very good machine and features for the Price. I researched several models, and this one had the most for the budget set.  Arrived new, unopened and ready to go. Quick easy step by step guide getting machine set up. The easiest out of the box set up ever!  Little to no bloatware.  I was hesitant about window’s 10, but it was very easy to set up like I am familiar with. My main use is for email, social media and searching the Web and its plenty fast for that. Really like the backlit keyboard, and the screen resolution is great. Have not really used the touch screen, but really glad I got the CD/DVD drive. Have already used that a few time.  Satisfied with the Computer.",
"I had high hopes for this laptop that I received today. Everything about it is great. It runs fast, beautiful display and exterior design. Yet, there is some functionality issues that I cannot look past. For one, the fan is very loud and distracting. The hard drive makes a static sound even when there aren't any programs running. Even after updating the Bios, there was no resolve. Also, the touchpad is terrible and not very smooth at all. It makes a lot of noise when you tap on it like there's a lose screw or something. It just doesn't feel sturdy at all. Maybe, I am just super particular... But I am going to have to return it.",
"Bought this product in early 2016 and is still worth almost the same as when I bought it almost 6 years ago (Nov 2021). Screen quality is great, processing power is great ( I ran the Adobe ecosystem as well as Video editing software). Notes: over the years battery might drain too quickly, however replacing the battery is fairly simple and solves the issue. Overall, one of the best purchases I have made.",
"Been using for a few days now and I will say I generally love it. It's great for its price, but like others have said, it can be a bit slow. It only takes awhile to turn on the first time you turn it off but after that it turns on super quickly! I do use this for some gaming and it can be slow then too, but nothing extreme. It has a great screen resolution, which I appreciate!
Overall, I really like this laptop, just can be a little slow but overall it was a great buy!",
"Bought for general use and occasional light gaming. Works great for everyday net surfing, emails, and video. The video quality is great in that HD looks like HD, however when viewing video -specifically a few amazon prime videos, the video does buffer and stutter occasionally, this is not an internet speed issue as I do not experience this with my desktop. But at this price range this is expected.For gaming, I've only tried league of legends and it maintains a constant 50-60 FPS on LOW settings. At medium to high settings it can drop as low as 20 fps during teamfights, but if you are just using for light gaming such as turn based or MOBAs, this pc does the job well.

Pros- back lit keyboard
HD videos
High brightness
Decent volume Speakers
Blutooth capabaility
QUICK startup -less than 10 seconds

CONS- stutters occasionally at 1080p videos
-average battery life",
"For the price the computer is pretty good.  Unfortunately the cd/dvd drive did not initially work probably because of a glitch in Windows 10.  Clearly our computer had Windows 10 over layed on windows 7 as opposed to a clean install. I was able to get the CD/DVD drive operational by following this you tube video:

https://youtu.be/MC_5NMROa8Q

 We will continue to see how the computer operates moving forward.  The key board is pretty flimsy, screen resolution is nice as is hard drive size.  Pretty much you what you would expect for an inexpensive computer.",
"After viewing it for the first time, I like the way it's made. the style and compactness of the laptop.  To my surprise my mic wasn't working nor the sound.  I called Dell and a gentleman helped me after I explained that I only had the laptop for only 3 hours after its arrival at my doorstep.  Anyway we had to eliminate the old sound driver and install a new one.  the window 10 OS is different than the 7 I am used too.  I do like the clarity and resolution of my screen.  the pictures are brighter, clearer, sharper,  and colors are alive.  I am still learning about my computer's OS.  I like what I have and won't trade it for any reason.  the last dell Inspiron lasted me 5 years until the mother board fried and then I bought this one.  Very happy old generation college student.",
"Lasted about 14 months.  About $42 per month cost of ownership with fairly heavy use (work and home)... which seems probably ok.  Had it seen lighter duty, I probably would've given it 2 stars instead of 3.

Replaced charger twice.  Power plug (female receiver inside computer housing) finally failed; became mushy and entirely unable maintain a connection to keep the machine powered, let alone charge the battery. That rendered the machine useless the the unit useless. Probably due partly because of design and partly me not being more careful. I think that's the second time that's happened with me and a Dell lappy. And that's reportedly a relatively (to the cost of replacing new) an expensive fix.

Really enjoyed the backlit keyboard and touch screen.  Will definitely get those on the next unit I buy,",
I received the computer and could not get the computer to boot.  It failed every time.  I went into boot sequence by hitting F12 at the beginning of the boot from a cold start.  After figuring out a setting change (which I believe was UEFI - I have dabbled enough in the past to know F2 or F12 for boot issues).  Once I changed the setting the computer booted as it should have and I have not had any issues with the computer since.  The only reason I give the computer a 4 is the initial startup.  Everything else has met my expectations.  The one thing I would say is battery life is a little short while using.,
"First I would like to say that I do PC repair and networking for a living and deal with computers and Windows operating systems on a daily basis so I am very aware of what I am doing. Soooo where do I start with this one... ok, so out of the box and first power up I notice a yellowy area at the top right of the screen all during boot and when the desktop comes up. To not see it you have to change the background to something in that color range. Then, upon trying to hook up any sort of audio device, headphones or speakers, it wouldn't recognize them and would play through the laptop speakers anyway or would output to external speakers (never the headphones) with a loud buzzing/humming noise. I adjusted every possible audio configuration in the computer to try to get it to output to the externals, I updated and installed drivers, I checked the config of the built in Dell audio software and it was all fine. So, defective lcd, defective audio in/out. I proved this by connecting the laptop to a docking station and connected the same speakers and headphones through that to a usb port on the laptop (surprisingly not defective also...) and they worked exactly as they should've. Not even going to the bother of sending it back and trying for a new one, because I'm sure half of it won't work either. So I'll be fixing this one myself. Quite disappointed.",
"I needed a laptop that was reliable for school, that could replace our old laptop when it goes, and that was also affordable. This is the third one I purchased. The first one (different company/brand) had to be returned because the mouse would freeze and then ultimately got the blue screen of death within 2 weeks after having barely used it (purchased online). The second one (also a different company/brand) wouldn't connect to the internet which I found to be a common problem with the model, so I had to return that one as well (purchased in a store). I couldn't find another laptop that was affordable in a store, but I was also hesitant to purchase online again, but I found this one. I've had it for almost a month now and have zero complaints. The speed on it is great. Everything seems to run smoothly with absolutely no problems. I'm not a huge fan of the touch mouse pad - I think I'd prefer a wireless instead, but I don't really think my preference for the mouse is enough to subtract my overall rating. I'd recommend it.",
"Great laptop, especially at this price point.  I would definitely recommend it friends.

Pros:
+ Love the full keyboard, and the keys themselves give great feedback.  Back-lit keyboard is a plus.
+ Battery life is good - I've had it running for 4+ hours and it was still at 50% charge.
+ Comes with a DVD burner - more useful than you may think still.
+ Hi-res screen is great (1920x1080), colors are vibrant.
+ Very little junk software pre-installed.

Cons:
- Comes with a regular HDD, not a solid state drive.
- Not crazy about the touch pad (particularly the lack of buttons), but it works fine for most tasks.
- It's a touch screen, which I don't use and it adds weight.  I turned it off in the device manager.",
"I am really really really happy with this purchase, for $488... This computer runs as good as my wife's Macbook Pro. It is silent, no loud fan, no lag no junk. One plus - being a ""Signature"" edition, there is no bloatware installed. Windows 10 is running great, and my transition (file transfer) was a breeze, just connect a network cable between the two computers and transfer away. Check YouTube for a how to. I only wish is that MS Office was included I really need it - I don't have the money for that right now.

I've been around computers for more than 20 years -If your looking for s laptop in the $500 range, you cant go wrong with this one. I was looking at and compared several other brands but decided on this i5558-578SLV because of the graphics, processor (although not the latest i5 by year) configured memory and HDD size. Asus, Lenovo couldn't match my requirements and the out the door price. If you are considering a laptop better hit the Amazon check out and get it. Don't forget MS office - I have to use my old computer till I can afford it. http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/pdp/Office-Home-Student-2016/productID.323023200?ICID=All_Office_ModO_HS16",
"My wife purchased his laptop for me. Already some years with me, I find this is a very stable laptop good for home and while on the road. It's been through a lot and held on all this time. What I really like though, is the backlit keyboard. I've had about four laptops now, but this is the first with a backlit keyboard and this feature alone is a godsend! Great for seeing the keyboard better and in low light, you can still type and not look for dark keys like others! It's a bit slow but otherwise, a great starter laptop. I use this mainly for image files archiving and review, and the screen resolution is perfect for this purpose, with the 8gigs of RAM helping speed up the process.",
"The computer itself was not bad, although I didn't have much time to evaluate it before the screen had broke while being in a laptop case, unsure the exact cause.  However Dell said if I sent it in for repairs it would cost me $261.00 plus shipping fees to replace the touch screen, because it was not an 'act of god'.  I didn't know what caused it, so it had to of been though...right?  Anyway,  because of my honesty of the screen breaking following his 'up sale' attempt at the start of our conversation, n he could no longer offer me the warranty that covered accidental damage as I had stated it was already broken.  Also had more issues with dell a year later when I discovered I could in fact still use the computer streamed to my tv using hdmi ( I had asked another dell agent how to do just that, and the tech guy told me it was impossible to setup without a working screen) .  However dell rep refused to give me the BIOS bypass code because I was past my original 1 year warranty unless I purchased another warranty plan for my laptop.

Summarized,  Call Acer if you have any technical problems and if you dont get accidental forgiveness as part of your warranty.. skip it completely!!
Since the 1 year warranty came with with my order of this laptop, I believe I am allowed to voice my experience on the products review as I am.",
"This is a nice computer with one big flaw, IMO. Because the number keys are placed to the right of the rest of the keys, they changed the center of the layout. The camera is placed at the screen's center but the keys are laid out with the touchpad to the left of center. I hate this design. I cannot naturally find my finger placement for the keys and have to look for placement every time I move my hand for the mouse. The keys are more flush than my last Dell which also makes it harder to feel the correct finger placement. So, for normal typing, the center of the keyboard is to the left of the screen and bottom platform. It is extremely frustrating and causes me to regularly type the wrong keys, grrrr. I hope this description makes since. I simply find the bottom platform and keyboard to be a very poor design for me.
I have deducted 2 stars because not easily finding the correct keys, for a long time computer and keyboard user, is a major defect. I wish I had realised how long it would take to adjust to this layout issue. I would have exchanged it right away. Now, I'm stuck with it.",
"I researched for weeks to find a laptop under $500 and I am so happy to find this specific model! Personally the most important spec for a laptop is the screen quality, especially the resolution. This is 1920x1080 which is true HD. Many people posted in forums that you cannot tell the difference between 1366 x 768 vs 1920x1080. People can be seriously WRONG! The picture quality between these two resolution is night and day! Which 15in screen, do not go below 1920x1080. When I watch Youtube videos at 1080, the picture is very crisp and detailed.
It is hard to find a 1080 screen for laptops under $500. This is one of the very few on the market. This laptop has 1tb hard drive with 8gb of RAM, which has plenty of power to do every day tasks. Keep in mind that it is not a gaming laptop.
The one best single upgrade is to change the drive to solid state drive, which will load anything at a lightening speeds. Stick with quality brand names such as Samsung(which comes with very important software to copy your original data including Windows into the new SSD). You also need USB 3.0 to SATA III Hard Drive Adapter Cable which costs arond $10.
One of the best laptops under $500!",
"This is a great buy for all the features and specifications this laptop has.  It's hard to find anything comparable for this price that also has the same screen resolution as this computer.  All comparisons under $500 didn't have the same screen resolution, or sacrificed some other aspect, like chip, or HD space.  I was a little worried given the price but after using it a bit, it's a very sturdy, practical, do-everything computer.  Obviously because of the price there some tradeoffs.  For example it's not the lightest notebook in it's class, but it's certainly not heavy at all.  It's slim and you could easily take it places without much trouble.  The main tradeoff at this price is that you're buying a standard HD, not solid state which means the HD spins and consumes more power, thus battery life won't be as good if you're a chronic road warrior, but it will last at a coffee shop or during a flight on full charge, especially if you manage the power settings appropriately.  The laptop also isn't jammed with bloat software, which I really appreciated.  If you're looking for a great basic laptop that can handle high intensity programs, graphics editing, or video, and are on a budget, you could do no better.",
"I've been using this for over a week and haven't run into any major issues.  The only thing I'm not thrilled about is how onscreen text can sometimes have a fuzzy look depending on what you're browsing.  This may be an issue with the settings, or I didn't notice it on my old laptop that had a much lower resolution.

The speakers are crisp and loud and you can really turn headphones up on this thing.  Volume half way with only earbuds is fairly loud.  The keyboard is fantastic.  The keys have a great feel and I don't think I could be without an illuminated keyboard anymore.  All programs I've tried so far load fast and operate well, including Photoshop.  The touchscreen hasn't failed me yet although I don't plan on using it often.  It wasn't a selling feature for me but nice to have the option.  All ports and jacks are pretty tight and feel like they'll stand up to lots of use.

Overall I'm happy and will update in a couple months to see how it holds up.",
"Overall - good piece of equipment. I am very satisfied!
I have info pop-ups every time I start the laptop with the booting time and i takes usually about 16-25 seconds to start Windows. This is pretty fast, you don't have to wait forever for the system to launch.
Windows 10 is OK, but you have to get used to it first if you haven't used it before.
The screen itself is surprisingly big - I can easily watch movies or work with 2-3 files simultaneously. Love the fact that it's touchscreen, I was concerned at first that it might start to glitch with a course of time, but so far so good. You can just swipe through the long list or zoom in our out anything in a second. Very handy.
The keyboard is back lit, which is pretty neat. I think you have to pay like extra $30 in other models/brands if you want to enable this.
Maybe the only thing that I would change is USB - it has only 1 USD 3.0 and 2 - 2.0. Personally, I don't see why they didn't installed all three 3.0, but that doesn't bother me that much. It is somewhat frustrating, since I do use devices which call for USB 3.0 and here I can't use them simultaneously, but once again - can't say that this is such a big deal... Can live with that.
Highly recommend. I doubt that you'll be able to find similar specs for this price.",
"Nice laptop at a decent price.  As others have said, the keyboard and casing feels really cheap to the touch, the hood of the lid is thin and hollow it would seem as it gives very easily to the lightest touch (feels thin like milk jug plastic), and the keyboard is bowed slightly (like a photo that is too large for its frame seat and bows upwards) but as a laptop, it's good.  It zips along nicely.  Just came from a Lenovo that got me to a point that I want to smash it on the shop floor.  So, having a good responsive laptop again makes me very happy.  Only had it 2 days so far, but set-up was fairly easy (took some time to load up all the programs and apps I need; like office, box, amazon, etc, but that is normal.  One thing of note, have not been able to get the printers to add-on successfully.  They load up, show as ready, then no printing.  Have tried two HP color Laser Jet, and one Canon Ink Jet thus far.  I will update as I figure this out).  It boots fairly quickly and multitasks very well.  4 stars only because of the paper thin plastics used for the casing and keyboard.",
"Want to waste $500 and hours of your time, then buy this computer.  I bought this computer because I had always heard good things about Dell and this computer was reasonably priced.  The issues started as soon as i fired it up the first time.  The computer would not stay connected to the internet when using Wifi.  It would connect for a couple minutes and then somehow magically disconnect on its own.  The only way to reconnect was to disconnect in the connection center and then reconnect manually.  When we contacted Dell tech support they were adamant it was our Wifi equipment even though all of our other wireless devices connected without issue.  When they finally agreed to send it in for service it took weeks for them to process the order only to return it in exactly the same condition.  This was the first time I sent it in.

The computer seemed to work for about a week when I got it back but  then it started to have the same issues.  We contacted tech support again and they tried all the same ""corrective actions"" they tried the first time.  We spent hours on the phone with tech support trying everything to fix the issue.  The computer then started giving me the Blue Screen of Death, I didnt even know that was a thing anymore but there it was. We ended up sending it in again to get repaired. Again, it took weeks to ""fix""

When we fired up the computer this time, not only did the computer yet again fail to stay connected to Wifi, the audio jack no longer worked.  Again, after hours on the phone with tech support and them trying pointlessly to fix this remotely we were getting ready to just accept that we bought a piece of garbage and just deal with it.  That was until something failed internally on the computer and now it constantly beeps loudly and it cannot be stopped.  5 beeps over and over and over.  Wont stop.  I contacted dell and said I have had enough after almost a year of broken equipment, hours and hours on the phone with tech support and months of waiting for the computer to get back from their repairs, I finally had enough and requested a refund for what obviously is a piece of junk product and inept tech support.  Dell said they will not refund and again only offered to ""fix"" the computer again.

The one thing that Dell does great is give you the run around.  They will transfer you from customer support to tech support to the warranty department and then right back to customer support.  Rinse and repeat over and over and over.

Save yourself a a huge headache.  Do not buy this Computer, in fact, i wouldn't recommend an Dell computers unless your looking for some sort of boat anchor.",
"I've had this laptop for about a week now and I haven't really touched my desktop since. The display is gorgeous . Unlike some of the others I haven't had any bleed in the corners. We use Kodi in my house for media I installed kodi and am able to easily watch everything on our NAS with ease, 1080p content looks great on it.

The laptop was up and running within a few minutes. The back-lit keyboard is nice as I spend a bit a time using it in bed after the hubby has went to sleep, so it's nice to be able to see what I'm doing instead of needing another light..

The touchpad is ok, but I don't really use it, I've always detested touchpads so I purchased a wireless mouse to go with this, and use it instead.

The touch screen is a nice addition though I suppose I could live without it if there wasn't one.

This laptop is not a gaming powerhouse, however I am able to easily use steam to stream any of the MMO's I play from my main gaming computer, it does handle that with ease. I might handle games better with a bit more memory than what it comes with, however I've not installed any, though from reading other reviews I see it is possible to take it up to 16 gigs instead of the 8 gigs it comes with.

This laptop is perfect for browsing the internet, using Microsoft office and watching and/or streaming media. It does all of those things extremely well.

I skipped windows 8 and honestly I'm glad I did I think it would've soured my experience with Windows 10, which I actually (surprisingly to myself) really like.",
"I have had this computer for a year now and the warranty is now expired.
PROS:
Back-lit keys
Nice touchpad and touchscreen
Good speakers
HDMI and 3.0

CONS:
Weak processor that isn't what was advertised
Cheap, easily broken DVD drive
Poor drivers for Windows 10
Charger broke before 12 months

Overall this computer has been a pain to own and I would not repurchase. It has a few good points, I like the back-lit keyboard even though there's this slight weird bulge in the middle of the laptop there, it doesn't bother me personally but its there fyi. I think the touchpad is nice and decently big, actually really liked where they put the speakers. They are on the front of the laptop and I feel like it does a good job of projecting the sound out, especially when its sitting on a table. Much better than if they were on the bottom like a lot of other computers. The sound of the laptop is pretty decent in general.
But that's about where my compliments about the computer end. Right out of the box it was really slow and laggy and the video driver would crash all the time. I called Dell a few times and they tried to help but mostly would just try things that didn't work for hours and then give up and tell me they were done and to call back if anything else happened. The video driver Dell makes for the integrated graphics on Windows 10 is not very compatible. Recently I have downgraded to Windows 7 and it is noticeably better, but I am noticing more how much of it is the fault of a weak processor. It still lags a bit more when surfing the web and moderate stuff like that than I think is normal. Which led me to notice that this computer is telling me it has a weaker processor than they advertised it as. This computer has an i5-4210U 1.70GHz 2.40GHz, when Amazon has it listed as i5-4210U 2.20GHz 2.70GHz. I wish I had noticed sooner and would have returned, because I feel like its too slow honestly. I had to replace the charger before I even owned it a year, so that's one thing. The last major problem I have had with it is that the disk drive has never worked on this laptop. I didn't try to use it until after months of owning it but it wouldn't read disks and no amount of troubleshooting did anything. So Dell sent me a new one to install myself and I did easily, but the very first time I went to use it I put the disk in and then it never came back out and makes this horrible noise now when you puch the button to open the tray. They refused to send another and told me I had to package the computer with my own box and send it to them so I never got it fixed. I would maybe consider utilizing the space with a better hard drive if it did not have such a weak processor. I would get rid of it, but I am required to buy a Macbook for the school I'm transferring to so I can just keep this as extra storage and to watch Netflix. I doubt it would get anything for it if I sold it anyway.",
"Five years ago I spent three times as much to buy my wife a Dell laptop that has less than half the capabilities of this unit.  It is amazing how quickly technology has improved and prices have come down.  After doing a ton of research, which is normal for me, I settled on this unit to handle
all of my computing needs while on the go.  It appears that I made a wise choice!

I am not a ""gamer"" nor do I multitask or use spreadsheets, therefore my needs might be quite a bit less than  yours.  On the other hand, I always try to get a bit more product than I really need to hedge myself for potential applications in the future. My emphasis is on reliability, efficiency, and portability.

Every Dell computer I've ever owned has always performed as promised. In fact, the only other manufacturer I've tried is Gateway (once) and their product was also well made.  Any problems I've encountered over the years have either been caused by my own inexperience and/or could be
rectified by a quick call to Dell Customer Support.  The performance and efficiency of this computer is limited only by the quality of the wi-fi available.  The slight delays and pauses of some wi-fi connections can be maddening but are not the fault of the computer.

As far as portability, this is far lighter and thinner than my wife's prior Dell 15.6"" laptop. I considered a smaller screen but my older eyes appreciate a larger screen and carrying this unit around with you is simple if you use the Amazon Basics Laptop sleeve.  Anything larger than an iphone 6+ requires something other than a pocket to transport it so it's really not a hardship to have a larger screen to carry.

The product description will provide you with all the information you need concerning storage, speed, ports, and functions.  The screen is exceptionally clear, the sound is acceptable (use headphones for best performance) the keyboard is familiar, has the right haptic feel (for me) and is backlit for easier night time use. The unit overall looks well made and is strongly and attractively constructed.  It is everything that you have come to expect from a Dell computer.",
"The worst laptop I've ever encountered.  Hardware is so cheap and brittle that it begins falling apart from top to bottom within a year.  THIS IS A DISPOSABLE LAPTOP.  Failure begins quickly and accelerates from there.

1.  Space Key Nonfunctional:  The space key is incredibly unresponsive.  I'm a touch-typist.  With the Inspirion, I type a paragraph, then find half the words ran together because the space key didn't work.  Not a problem with any other computer I've ever used.

2.  Touchpad:  The touchpad on the Inspiron is one of those unified pieces with both the right-click and left-click buttons integrated into a single unit.  This frequently results in right-clicking when you meant to left-click.  It also takes major effort to do the click -- probably twice as much pressure as old Lenovo G50.  A set-up for repetitive stress injury, particularly tendonitis of the elbow.  (Ask me how I know.)

3.  Windows 10:  No improvement over the functionality of Windows XP or Windows 7.

4.  Processing Speed:  Good.  The Intel I5 processor is fast -- the only good part of the Inspirion.

5.  Screen:  The screen is bright and clear.  The touchscreen function works, although it has one enormous defect (see below).

6.  Wifi Connection:  Weak!  I can't go far from my Wifi router with the Inspirion.  The Wifi connection simply cuts out at distances where my other devices have no problem maintaining a connection.

7.  Touchscreen Defect:  The frame around the touchscreen is so thin and fragile that if you apply even slight pressure to the upper right hand corner of the frame, it will depress the ""X"" on an open Internet window and close out your browser.

I gave the Inspirion one star because of the nonfunctional space key and injury-inducing touchpad.  These defects taint every interaction I have with the laptop.

Update 1/1/2017:  After many months with the Inspirion, my experience has gotten worse.  There is now a weird glitch where the icons in the lower right hand corner of the screen (sound, power, wifi signal, time and date) start flashing in and out, the cursor goes haywire, and the touchscreen acts like I'm pressing it in random places even though my hands are still on the keyboard.  The haywire cursor will even close me out of open browser sessions involuntarily.

I am current on updates from Microsoft and my Norton security scans show no viruses.  This appears to be a glitch unique to the Inspirion.  I am pretty sure I will never purchase another Dell product.  This Inspirion has been a huge disappointment.

Update 2/14/2017:  Just when I thought this laptop couldn't get worse....

1.  Now the adapter plug (the part that inserts into the laptop) has become so loose that it randomly loses the electrical connection and stops charging while inserted.  I think it's charging, only to find the battery has run down.  ARGH!

2.  Windows 10 glitches the printer drivers for my HP printer.  When I print a document, a ""ghost"" of the document remains stuck in the queue with an error message, preventing anything else from printing.  Sometimes Windows lets me delete the document, but most of the time it either won't delete at all or takes 30 minutes or so to delete.  Now, routine printing of multiple documents is an enormous hassle.  (And it's not the drivers -- I've re-downloaded them directly from HP.

Update 6/12/17:  Two new problems:

1.  Brittle Frame:  The plastic from which the bottom frame is made is so flimsy and brittle that the lower left hand corner is cracking around the USB ports.  I haven't dropped the machine or done anything rough with it.  The frame is simply falling apart from normal, gentle use.

2.  Display Cable Defect:  The screen often flashes vertical colored lines for extended periods, rendering it useless.  I've read that this machine has defective display cables that cause this problem.  I've attached clamps on both sides of the screen because depressing those areas seems to help.  But what a RIDICULOUS thing to have to do to a laptop that is less than two years old!

Update 7/31/17:  The HDMI port is no longer working.  I insert the HDMI cable for my second screen and get ... blackness.  It usually lasts a couple of minutes, then the screen will start flashing on and off or give me a ""no signal input"" message.  Eventually, the connection somehow stabilizes and I get a normal screen.

There is literally nothing hardware-related that has not gone wrong with this laptop.  It is the crappiest computer I've ever seen, much less owned.

*****I CAN'T SAY IT ANY MORE STRONGLY:  DON'T BUY THIS LAPTOP.  DON'T BUY THIS LAPTOP.  DON'T BUY THIS LAPTOP.****",
"I've had this computer for nearly 4 years now and I've gotten very close with it in that time. It isn't the best for gaming, I can't even run a few games on the lowest quality settings. The screen is high quality, but you will notice bright spots around the edges when the screen is dark but still in use. The touch screen had this problem where it would activate with nothing touching it so I just turned it off permanently. The track pad is responsive and works very well, and the keyboard is back lit and sensitive. The battery on my laptop randomly started malfunctioning and did not hold a charge and any time it was plugged into the computer it would freak out and start flashing lights rapidly. There is a small spot where some pixels have died but I cannot even see it unless the screen is totally dark. A screw stripped out of its hole and I have to tape my laptop together on the corner where the hinge is because of that. Not a lot of RAM, and the CPU gets used up pretty quickly, but it is still a fast and reliable computer with a great value for its price point and I use it every day. Perfect if you want a laptop that will run low-intensity games that don't require a good graphics card. The Sims 4 works fine on low settings, OSU plays well- with occasional lag, some games are for some reason nearly unplayable if they access the internet to load up (steam games) which I experienced with Firewatch and The Long Dark. Even despite my issues with the laptop I really do love and am happy with my purchase and see myself continuing to use it for several more years to come!",
"First of all, this is a GREAT computer.  It's only hampered by running Windows 10, which CONSTANTLY is updating, and on the traditional disk drive here, it's very slow for updates.  The drive is 1 TB, so there's tons of space.  But it's so slow that it takes hours to manage Windows updates.  And that's not even mentioning that some Windows updates in the past have caused massive problems like lost files, never to be recovered.  It's very strange.  If this were a Chromebook, it would be a beast.  But I got it for the DVD/CD thing to transfer files from DVD/CD and to play games.  It actually can play games.  I ran Fallout 3 at around 30 FPS.  Sometimes dipping to 20s, but I certainly could play the game and have fun - it was similar to a Playstation 3 experience of the game.  So it can do that.  The display is fantastic and I never used the touch screen.  Also, the keyboard is the worst keyboard I have ever used in my life.",
"I have purchased two dozen computers or more in the past two decades but this one is right up there with the very best of them.

It took me a month to decide on a new computer for a new business I am launching and I decided that, short of switching to Apple, Dell has the best reviews in laptops.

The price was unbelievable, this model has everything I wanted and no bloat-ware (so happy never to see McAfee again, ever!). I especially love the action on the keyboard. The entire surface is some sort of velvety rubber-like material that is comfortable and does not show fingerprints. The keys have the right amount of firm ""crunch"", and the backlit feature works beautifully. I don't mind it going off to conserve energy -- the minute you touch any key, it comes back. Genius.

The outer shell is beautiful too with a corduroy-like finish that will resist marks and scratches. The whole unit feels substantial for a laptop (and I have had many that were either too heavy or too flimsy, in the past).

Setup was effortless. Literally plug and play simple. I am no techie and really appreciated that. It did take some effort to find the place to register (I just went to the Dell main page and found it there), and I think that should be more evident in the apps or somewhere more intuitive, but that was the only drawback to getting the unit up and running.

With a few keystrokes, I synced it to my other Windows Desktops and now I can move to any of them and work seamlessly.

With one Terabyte of HD, I can download beefy software and keep data on a thumb-drive. The RAM is perfect and the processor enables fast loading of sites and software.

The best for last: I do a lot of artistic photography work and the resolution on this computer is exceptional. Brilliant, beautiful screen display. I don't find the gloss finish distracting nor is there too much glare, so I don't intend to add a filter over it.

The perfect computer. Let's face it, we don't hold onto computers for a decade any more. Most of us have to get new ones at least every few years. However, this one seems destined to last for more than most and I can see already that I will be quite attached to it.",
"As a long-time Mac user and a very, very reluctant Windows user, I have to say I could almost switch back to Windows based on my experience with  this Dell laptop. I was a bit worried as the whole sum of instructions consists of a five panel pamphlet about the size of a CD and mostly pictures and not words. As I was girding myself for the interminable suffering of online search for anticipated help needs because it's Windows, and rearranging my schedule in my head to carve out the time, this little Dell quietly finished the set-up and was ready to begin. Dell really did their homework and made this crazy easy right out of the box.

This laptop comes pre-installed with Windows 10, which for many may be a deal-breaker, but I found I was able to get going and navigate around the OS immediately and with extreme ease. Having read the reviews and rants, and this being my first go-around with Windows 10, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it. I easily installed some apps, got them onto the task bar and home screen (or whatever it's called) and once the housekeeping was done (connecting to the WiFi network, printers, other devices, etc.), I was off and running.

The keyboard is just the right set of responsiveness, not too touchy nor does it require a firm press. And for a laptop, the keys are spaced well enough for my hands. Someone with large hands may find it too cramped, but hey, it's a laptop and you can always plug in an external keyboard.

It's lightweight and slim enough to easily tote around all day, and indeed it did not become a horrible burden on my shoulder during a recent business trip. It starts up quickly, runs smoothly and quietly. The built-in speakers are pretty decent and getting the laptop to pair via bluetooth was a snap (like it is on the Mac). The screen is gorgeous, truly gorgeous. I was bowled over at the crisp clarity and brilliance of color. In the hotel room I really put it to the test (you know, that horrible laggy hotel Internet speed) and watched an episode of a show through Amazon Prime and whoa, it was like watching a high quality HD TV. Yes, there was some lag because I refuse to pay the $20 per day for the ""premium"" Internet service, but nowhere near as bad as with my older Mac laptop. The next day as I whisked through a PowerPoint presentation, several people caught the view from my screen and almost immediately the meeting went from an artfully arranged agenda to playtime with my new Dell. After fawning all over it, the price tag question came up and upon learning the price, everyone went nuts.

There are plenty of really good reviews about the technical specs, but if you are looking for a solid laptop for business and/or student use, this is an amazing value!! I still love my Mac, but my little Dell has earned a coveted spot on my desk too!",
It’s a nice laptop not for gaming. But run nice video and sound ok. Not bad at all.,

Supposed to be Windows Pro - Windows home in S.

Extremely sad and angry.  I had to buy a laptop for working from home, and now I can't even use it.

Please, do not fall for this one. It is so very wrong.",
There was no room to load anything on this. All the space was already used by the preloaded programs.,
"Do not bother trying to buy a laptop with Windows 10 with only 32 GB hard disk space. It isn't enough to even update to the current version. I tried removing as many apps as I could, move as much as I could to a SD card. Nothing. Returned it, going to look for something with much more space. Otherwise I loved the style of this, looked and felt great! Touch screen looked amazing! A bit slow, kinda wish it just had more disk space and I would have kept it.",
Works great. Exactly what I was looking for.,
"El producto no me trajo el lápiz que aparece en el retrato, además necesito saber cómo consigo el cargador",
This laptop looks like it is brand new! Item exceeded my expectations ! I use this for my writing (hobby) it’s perfect size.,
as soon I reached out my issues were resolved within minutes. this was a great deal. I'm very satisfied with the customer service I received.,
Bought this for school and work. Its perfect! Smaller laptop makes it easier to handle and use and love the way it converts. Touchscreen is nice as well. Great graphics and sound.,
Couldn't fully install Windows leaving it with no space,
"The laptop itself is a good looking design; however, internally it has major drawbacks. I could not install more than 5 applications without it continually sending error messages about the memory being overloaded. When it came to any attempts to update Windows they all failed because of the memory issues and this was even when I deleted any external files and applications. It's truly ridiculous that the system files just by themselves can fill almost 30 GB, but according to the error messages this is what the problem was. I attempted many troubleshooting methods and none worked even to the point of buying a 2TB external hard drive. None of this resolved the issue. When I reached out to Amazon they sent a replacement and the replacement had the same issue. Both the original and the replacement have been returned and I'm sticking to my 3 year old Lenovo for now.",
"We ordered the WIndows 10 laptop (pictured with the touchscreen pen) but we received a Chromebook (no pen).  It was a Christmas gift for a child, so aren't returning it.  Overall the device is nice and was a great deal - just wish we got what we ordered.",
"Product arrived quickly. I had a question with the initial setup and was able to get customer support, an actual human that I could understand. Very helpful!",
I wasn't expecting to love it the way I do. Came a week early. Heavier then I thought it would be. Smaller then most (I like that) you can talk to it like Alexa and it will pull whatever you want up. Take notes on the pages ?? I love this one! Tried to upload pics but I couldn't share them.,
"I'm sorry if I missed it, but i did not see anywhere that mentioned that a power cord is NOT included with the purchase. And honestly I'm ok with that, but it should be VERY clear that it is not included. I got my device and it won't even startup.
I don't know if it's any good until the power cord I ordered comes in. so now I have to check it out and if there is a problem, I have to return it AND the power cord separately and look for something else....",
"When I initially fired it up for the first time the general response of the operating system was ridiculously slow. It almost took a full minute to even open the control panel. The responsiveness of the screen was not much better. It was painfully slow or inconsistent. I eventually deleted all the bloatware and that has helped. However, despite the low price point and specs I at least expected it to be usuable to light web browsing and using google docs which was practically impossible straight from the box. Overall, would not purchase this again but not unhappy enough to return it.",
"Aside from marginal battery life and low on the memory side the things the main area of concern is the fact tthe display went out in the middle of a presentation after only one month of use. The item is still totally functional and I was able to use the built in HDMI port to finish the presentation. All things aside it seems like a pretty good unit for the money. I contacted Amazon and they shipped me a replacement everybody to return label for my presently defective item. Good service by way of Amazon I look forward to posting a very positive review as a follow up to this one.
In the name of full disclosure, this item is a refurbished item.",
"For what I needed it for, the price and features are decent but it comes with so much unnecessary bloatware that you literally can't even do a windows update.  It was ridiculous and even AFTER clearing most of it out, the memory was still underwhelming.",
This Acer Spin is super cute and professional. perfect size to carry around. Touch screen is super handy. Only dislike it 24 hrs after set up it notified that storage was almost full. To be expected but still not wonderful on a new device. Be sure to purchase external memory :),
"The headline says it all. I bought this for my daughter. Windows can't upgrade anymore because it ran out of space. But it keeps trying and bugging you to do it, which is impossible. And you can't run more than one thing at a time--it gets bogged down. Awful experience. I wish I'd gotten her something better the first time around. Also, from what I can tell reading online, you can't upgrade the memory nor the storage space because both are soldered in place.",
I have been using the Acer Spin 1 for a week now and I absolutely love it . The laptop looks great and it is really fast and I loved the fact that it comes with a stylus . I only wish that the battery last a little bit longer but other than that it is truly an awesome laptop,
"There was something wrong with my Macbook Pro, but I need to use computer every day. So I chose Acer Spin 1 as an temporary substitution. I didn't expect it to behave well, but surprisingly, its color is vibrant, the processing speed is fast, the keyboard is nice and the touchscreen is really awesome. Only one pity: the trackpad is not so sensitive. But anyway, it's really cheap and worth it. If you want to have a try, or your budget is pretty tight, you can choose it!",
"My only issue is there's no way to add more internal space, but after using it for several weeks most programs that I use could work on an sd card.
I really love the pen that came with it. I assumed it was just a stylist but it has pressure sensitivity and makes art a lot of fun.
I bought it for when I was out I could have some simple entertainment, drawing, writing, or small simple video games, but as of now I rarely turn on my main pc. I just use this laptop for everything except games that require an actual gpu.",
"So far the Laptop is great, came with the pen that works amazing, the laptop does not oveheat but yes gets a little warm, is not super powerful (used max 3 chrome tabs), the metal exterior feels amazing and premium, as well as the screen (full HD)
The only downside is the processor (can't really do much multitasking) as well as the storage, after installing Office 365 I was left with 3.6gb and with some personal files got to the point of 1.3gb so be aware of that.
Besides all of it…I got the laptop with a few details that aren't super important but aestheticly they are not pleasant (more in the pictures)",
"An amazing little laptop with ultra thin and slick design. The size is handy and portable. IPS 1080p display offers a crystal clear quality with toushscreen function. Metal body creates an elegant feeling and professional view. 4GB memory is not large but enough for my daughter study.  Running stable and speedy. Incredible like new condition but almost 40% off discounted price compared to new, very worthy to deserve it.",
"The laptop was used, it's not new. It's cool to get someone's account when you unpackage ""new"" item. Moreover, there's a problem with SSD, now it runs boot menu (",
"1 Star. Ok quality, can't change default function keys, it ran at max temp for the first month, and now 2 months later the touchscreen has errors and registers several not real inputs, then shuts down, depending on screen position. Will not buy another. Will not recommend MSI products. Used only lightly for personal home / streaming use.

8 month Update. Over all needed to return 3 times for touchscreen issues, each time being repaired, then lasting ~2 months before failing again. After the third failure I received a new unit, (different S/N) to which I am going to sell second hand as NIB. Quality of the device was over all ok for ~$1400. Still the device runs hot, uncomfortably on a lap. Speakers are worse then my 10yr old Lenovo Yoga, and the battery life while browsing and streaming is good for ~5 hrs. Overall disappointed, but I will raise to 2 stars as the exchanges and returns for warranty where very easy, and MSI covered it all no questions asked, usually only taking 6-8 days.",
"We bought this laptop back in November of 2022, and go figure it breaks just after the one year warranty expires!

This laptop was pretty nice for what it packed into a small package.  Sweet features with the touchscreen, fingerprint unlock, 32gb RAM.  But it just did not last.  We used this laptop lightly for travel/personal use and never abused it.
It started having an issue where the mouse pointer would jump to a certain spot on the screen, and then dance back and forth.  The pointer changing to a sort of crosshair look.  This problem started to happen more and more frequently and now the laptop cannot be used for more than 2-3 minutes without it happening.  Tried various forms of troubleshooting and after finally taking it in the problem is apparently the motherboard.  MSI offered to fix it... for more than the cost of the entire laptop.  This has been extremely disappointing as the issue is from the parts used to build this machine and MSI wont take any responsibility for it because the warranty just expired.

Overall this experience has decidedly made us unlikely to ever purchase an MSI product again.",
I bought this tablet for my daughter and she enjoys it! Perfect for watching YouTube or playing games and so far she has used it everday. No complaints,
a good laptop for study and practice,
"Bought my first Asus laptop in January 2012, and it has served me well. I still have it and everything still works, but it likely needs a new battery (only stays on when plugged in), and is running Windows 7 so I figured it was time to finally upgrade. It still starts up in under 30 second, runs quick, and does all I need it to do, but having to tape the cord to the port is a little too far in the trenches for me. Hahaha!! Although I am getting a warranty extension for submitting this review, it is definitely not in any way motivated by the incentive, as I had already made up my mind that it was going to be Asus or nothing when I started my search. The laptop is BEAUTIFUL! The screen is a great size at 16"", and it is so slim that carrying it around all day is no biggie. I am a real estate agent so being able to work on the go is essential (one of the reasons I knew I needed to upgrade), and this checks all the boxes. Harmon Kardon speakers give great quality sound while I'm listening to my music and the speed makes my daily work tasks a breeze. The ONLY thing I don't like is the placement of the 0 on the 10-key numeric pad, but that is something that can easily be forgotten once I get used to using it more. Since I bought my original Asus in 2012, my siblings and parents have gone through 2 Macbooks, 2 Chromebooks, and a Lenovo that have all conked out after a few short years (I don't think any of them made it to their 5th birthday. haha!). The price is definitely nothing to wince at, and luckily I caught it on sale, but remember that YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR. A $300 computer may seem like the way to go, but why do that to yourself when you'll be back in 3 years looking for a replacement? Asus has stood the test of time and I will not ever purchase any other brand. To me, they are truly top tier. Don't just buy a laptop; INVEST in one...THIS one!",
"Laptop is well built, working just like new",
"This computer has NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070, which is perfect for playing games, running stable diffusion, and/or otherwise doing something that requires a lot of VRAM.

For some reason, '3070 ti' version crashes, freezes, glitches, and otherwise has a ton of problems, but the 3070 version (without the 'ti' part) works perfectly. The upgraded 40 GB of RAM is also nice.",
Only thing I have with this was a hard drive connected to it after week or so buying it. So it will be very good idea to make sure that you can get the warranty for it cause didn't cost me anything to get it fixed. Afterwards it works perfectly for both gaming and my job.,
My son somehow still broke it in a few weeks but it handled a lot of play! The games are preloaded but can still get YouTube and other services. The holder for this is thick rubber so it can handle being dropped highly recommended,
Best kids tablet fully loaded with lots of games and easy to use.,
"I really like the ability to control what and where my grandchild can go on the web.  The included games are great, and the added bonus of being able to set time limits is just icing on the cake.",
"We purchased this tablet for our daughter and she loves it! We love that it is very kid friendly, yet can still be used by us when it's out of the kid mode. Great product!",
"wow my 6 year old loved it. bought it this after noon and has been playing it for 6 straight hours... easy for y
her and fun plus shes learning at thhe same time... great gift.",
My son got this for Christmas this year. He absolutely loves it! Easy to use and educational. Will definitely recommend!,
great product. my kid loves it and its very educational,
"I have twins boys and I bought two for their 5th birthday in December it didn't even last long, it was a waste of my money. By March I bought two Kid Contixo Tablet, definitely worth the money.",
"I bought this product for my 2 year old son. He loves the games that came with it, especially the interactive alphabet games and number games.  It is also child safe. I also downloaded his favourite songs from youtube. Had to purchase an extra memory card though, but all in all a great product. Would recommend to any parent wanting to buy their kid a first tablet.",
"Both of my kids got this for Christmas this year, and both of their tablets have crashed completely and repeatedly... resulting in me having to do a factory reset.  They love playing the games on here, but all their progress and saved games are wiped every time it crashes.

I've also never been able to use the pre-installed amazon app on there.  I only get a message saying that I cannot sign in temporarily or something...

For me, this is a frustrating tablet and it is annoying to re-download and set everything up again all the time but my kids like the games and enjoy it when it works.",
"My 5 year old loves it, great for educational games and puzzle games. Processor does lag when playing Temple run and other fast paced games but she is not up to that yet. Installed apps are great as is the FunTV app that has lots of videos to choose from when connected to wifi.",
Nice kids tablet. Alot of apps. Wprry free in the sense of can limit kids to kid based activituesFun and easy to use. Be careful when charging the port is delicate.,
I bought this for my child for 2014 Christmas.  After 6 months it would turn on and cycle but never made it to the home screen.  I put it up and after 3 months I noticed it looked like it was separating...I tried turning it on and there was nothing.  Another 3 months went by and I noticed a huge gap and what looked to be a swollen battery!  I contacted Ematic customer service (which says not to call but to email) and received no response.  I noticed today the tablet is completely in two and the battery is about to explode (I have again contacted via email) but I am too afraid this thing is going to pop.  If your looking for a very very temporary tablet it was nice while it lasted.,
"So far I am enjoying getting to know this tablet. I got it for my 2 year old son for Christmas so he hasn't been able play with it yet but I know he's going to love it because it had games featuring the characters from the ""Baby's First"" channel. If it makes it through Christmas with him I'll update my review. Definitely perfect for the price!",
"A little difficult to get started as the apps didn't seem to want to download through their installed program and I kept getting an error message hen trying to sign on to the amazon mall for applications which this went on for days, more like weeks. At this time I have not yet tried to install through the computer or go any further. I've simply stopped after reading the troubleshooting for installing app which involves checking some settings and what not.

Otherwise the product seems nice. Best for probably ages 3 or 4 and up. Those who can follow instructions and are closer to understanding and mastering preschool teachings and concepts. Not as much protection as you may expect or want when paying such for a little ones entertainment so I would recommend buying any additional case/cover or whatever you can (don't forget the screen protector).

Not a big choice in colors but we got the bluish teal and it's mostly a pretty summer bright ocean aqua, mixed right down the middle, not more blue not more green but nice and better for a girl I think but we got for a boy. Still nice.

I think once I get the applications on it will be fine. My son is only 2 and doesn't use it very well but can still color/draw and play silly games like the Ant Smasher. Of course if I wasn't having problems installing apps I could tell you what else is there but since it uses Android you can just search here through Amazon for apps. I LOVE Android ad will stay with them.

So overall I would recommend this. Even my 7 year old enjoys it. Games for all ages... including adults!! ??",
"Anyone considering this tablet needs to know that this is the VERY FIRST version of the Funtab. There has been a Funtab 2 and the newest is the Funtab 3. This first version is very inferior to the new Funtab 3. And guess what, it costs $30 to $40 more! This very outdated version only has Android 4.2 and a very small 8GB of storage. And the newer Funtab 3 has Google Play Store which is FAR superior to the very limited Amazon App store that charges money for many of the same apps on GPS that are FREE. The newer F3 has Android 5.1 which is a much more efficient operating system that gives longer battery life for one thing. It also has twice as much storage at 16GB. So you can add a lot more free games from Google Play Store. Not that you'll even need to for a long time. This tablet has SO many great games your kid will be entertained for many months. And not just entertained, but LEARNING. Nearly every game on this tablet teaches something valuable. As a tablet seller for many years I can highly recommend this tablet (Funtab 3) as the best tablet on the market for ages 2-5. Even better than a Leapfrog? Yep! Leapfrog is great for ages 3-9. But for strictly preschool kids nothing beats this tablet. It's a steal at $50-$60. But do yourself a favor and buy it brand new, not used or refurbished. The price difference is only about 5 or 10 bucks. Many tablet dealers sell used or refurbished that are actually store returns and all you're getting are someone else's problems. Two other tips.....get a screen protector right away. You need all the protection you can get with kids. And don't let kids charge it. They'll ruin the delicate charging port. If it stops charging, first thing is try a new USB cable. At least half the time that's the problem. And if you happen to get a bad tablet make sure you exchange it for another right away. Remember....Funtab 3.",
Met my expectations,
No se puede conprar al internet,
I brought this for my three year old granddaughter and she is loving. it is exactly as advertise,
"Worse purchase ever.  Would not recommend, in fact wouldn't want it if it were free.",
I bought this on Aug 1 and it no longer will take a charge...very disappointed in spending $105 dollars for 2 months of use!,
Got this for christmas for my son worked for a few times now its stuck on startup screen did a factory reset and its still the same,
I buy this for my niece she love it .she tell to every one how cool her Christmas gift look thanks you,
It's just slow,
grandson loves,
One keeps signing out of internet the other battery lasts 30min,
Super slow even my grandma thought it was too slow,
"My daughter received the Ematic FunTab for Christmas and loves it! I like the parent settings that keep her engaged in playing games, but locked out of accessing google or anything else. I can hand her the tablet and not worry about anything else while she plays educational games.",
this tablet will only work if plugged up.,
It was all set up for kids which I like but only lasted for about a week,
Wouldn't even work it came on but didn't do anything can't hold a connection worst tablet ever had to purchase the pbs kids tablet instead,
"Bought 2, neither one worked",
"Stopped working after being used 3 times. Have 3 support requests in , also called Ematic only to have to leave name and phone number. 5 days since I started tying to get help no one from Ematic has contacted me. I'm going to return the fun tab 2 and get my grandson another tablet other than an Ematic one. What a failed christmas gift.",
"The tablet worked great, until it blew up with a loud pop. I was installing a few additional application, so nothing major and it popped. After that, dead, no way to turn it on. No way to remove battery, factory reset did not work, nothing.

The end result is that I just purchased a Samsung Tab4 with kids mode and a descent pink NewStyle case that has a handle. My daughter loves it.",
Had for 4 days and that's what it for stuck on a crashed OS it bricked itself turning on I'm very upset 40 dollars for a tablet today it should at least work for youtube don't buy this one,
If you feel like regretting something then buy this.,
"My 5-year-old granddaughter loves her FUNTAB2. It is very easy to use and has a lot of APP options.  It would have been nice had it had a bigger internal memory; although, we can purchase an SD card for it.  All-in-all it is a great product and we would definitely buy it again.",
Couldn’t connect it to internet which meant it couldn’t be even turned on without being plugged in. Company was no help. Contact led them for help never heard back.,
To hard to use for my grand child,
"A very cheap tablet. Screen brightness sucks, volume sound sucks, the “child proof case” is just a rubber pad that doesn’t seem to be terribly protective. My son had absolutely no interest in this tablet until I downloaded Netflix. So I reckon for that purpose, it’ll do. But again, he can hardly hear what he’s watching. Even for the low price I’m disappointed.",
I disliked the fact that I couldn't download from playstore.the Funtab took 1week to load. Google apps don't work. YouTube don't work. The icon below the screen disappeared. I'm super angry about this purchase because it's not working.my kids are disappointed.,
"Fun games, but couldn’t get the movies/ shows to play even after checking internet connection.",
"This was the second FunTab I have purchased. We love this tablet, based on BabyTV. I am still finding games and learning programs on it! (Lazy about reading features, haha)  With parental controls in place, my child can watch selected videos as well.",
This tablet cant even run the apps that it comes with its garbage i got 2 of them and they both suck they die in less that 2 hours cant play the most basic games let alone the ones built in these things are just garbage,
Excellent learning tool.,
"Got this item for my nephew that has autism. This “tablet” worked for maybe a day, but it was so very slow. It took forever to download his apps such as Netflix and Disney+. When he was able to use it, all of his shows and movies would constantly be buffering and trying to load and I know it wasn’t my internet speed. The first time it died, after charging all night, all the screen showed was a bar that displayed “Android is starting… Optimizing app 1 of 60” and has done nothing since.",
Quick fast delivery works perfect and easy to use and durable,
"If negative stars was a thing this sorry excuse for a computer would get it. This piece of crap doesnt support skype, wont let me use hulu or netflix. I spent $250 on computer you seriously cant even right click with. honestly a 3 year old would be let down with this piece of junk, hope you see this acer, I expected better from you.",
"Barely last past 60 days, I ordered this in March By beginning of June Lines appeared across the screen.... it was for my daughter and yes it is my fault that I did not return it right away..... but life happens and I’m extremely busy so I went past the warranty and all this seller did was directed me to an outsourced technician..... thanks for NOTHING",
Perfect !,
"this is slow.  I have another Acer chromebook that is 2 years old and is much faster.
it was 100 dollars more new.
will live with this slower model, best I can do for the price I guess.",
"I was very skeptical in buying a certified refurbished chrome book. I read some great reviews and a few bad ones, so I decided to try for myself. I’m glad I did!! There was not one scratch on it and the packaging was great! It came with the plugs as some people said theirs didn’t. The only thing I had to get used to is that there is no delete button but other than that easy to use, easy to set up and it was a great product with an awesome price!!! Would recommend, great for high school and college students!!",
Great laptop for working from home.,
I ordered a 15.6 inch touchscreen laptop and I received a 14 inch laptop. I am soo pissed now. How can such a serious error be made? Horrible!!!!,
"I love how light it is! Very simple set up and it runs great. It is the best price for 15inch laptop with touch screen, newest i5 processor and 512G SSD

P.S.  it arrived 3 days earlier. loving it.",
"I used this one time and the second time it froze on blue screen. I have wasted hours on this. Customer service is awful (they disconnected me twice and never called back, and no one speaks English) and this product is junk. . Stay clear.",
"no leí bien pero quería un poco más de espacio en el HDD. Esta un poco elevada de precio pero la necesitaba para mi hijo. Muy rápida, no trae unidad de DVD. Del resto todo bien",
"I bought this for my daughter who is a Roblox gamer. Machine is an excellent value for the money. Ordered the model with Intel Core i3 CPU, 8GB RAM, and 256GB SSD. Machine boots quickly and runs all Roblox games fast and smooth. Video is clear and bright at 1080p. Machine is mostly used while plugged into AC so I enabled the battery life mode which sets maximum charge to 60% which reduces stress on the battery and extends lifetime. I love Lenovo and this is the 4th Lenovo laptop I have purchased.",
"Ordered an IdeaPad 330s with a usb-c port, received an IdeaPad 3 with a usb 2.0. I live in Puerto Rico, so it took a month for the laptop to arrive. My father decided to keep it since he didn't want to wait another month for a replacement. Someone at sparkdeals need to get his stuff together and start paying attention to detail so this stuff doesn't happen again. Laptop is fast though.",
Shuts down randomly if not connected to power. Cannot find customer support contact info. Do not buy.,
"Paid for high features, but got with less. I actually ordered this for 472$ which was expected to be 1920*1080 screen resolution and 3.4 Ghz memory speed, it came with 1366*768 screen resolution and 1.2 Ghz memory speed.

Keyboard is good, quiet, but there is no backlight. Plus it is not touchscreen.",
Excelente,
university studies,
"This is a good looking machine, thats abiut the inky good thing I can say because I didnt get to far into it before I realized instantly the display resolution was incorrect, the SSD storage was incorrect as well. I contacted and used the chat to tell an Amazom customer srvice rep the issues and that the description of the item on Amazon.com was wrong. I returned and they promised they would get it right and they didn't. Always check your stuff.",
"Great product, all what i expected",
"As a basic computer for everyday needs, it's fine under the hood, except for the camera. Using zoom with this computer will leave you looking like a grey grainy mess, which in the current climate, means this computer is not really appropriate for anyone. Beyond that failing though, the exterior of the is awful. The edges of the base are rough and sharp in places. I end up with red marks on my lower arms and wrists after just a few minutes of typing from rubbing against them. The touch pad is also very loose, and the press locations are finicky, very hard to hold and move something, or do any sort of advanced maneuvers other than basic clicking, which even that requires precision.

Overall I regret my purchase. It's terrible that Amazon doesn't allow returns on computers. If I'd known that I would have purchased elsewhere.",
"The description says 1920x1080, but its not the case. The max screen resolution is 1366x768. I already wear glasses and just looking at this screen gave me a headache. I had to return the next day. Everything else is great, except the screen resolution.",
"A month ago I bought this lenovo ideapad laptop it was working just fine for the 3 weeks... but after  a night of work ( I bough it so I can work from home ) I tried to turn it on the next day  and it would not ....  Tried connecting it with the charger but it would charge or turn on ... After talking with Lenovo they suggested it was static that build in the battery , so i disconnected the main and the cmos  battery and press the power button for a minute so the static would disappear.... But nothing work... After that it came to my knowledge that the mother board just died over night ... The computer had a month in my hands so amazon would not take it back ... Lenovo will not help either so I'm sitting here with no tools to work , 500 plus $ less in my account and a laptop that was nearly used only for Microsoft word... I would really recommend to stay away from lenovo since it seems dead mother board is a trend among them ....",
"I bought this computer for school use because computers at my household are heavily used. My daughter is doing online distant learning and my college courses are online. I got the computer and charged it for 24 hrs. When I turned it on it was 80 percent charged. Not a big deal. Then I started personalizing it, it won't allow you to add Chrome. In the other posts it says you can call tech support but I did not. The computer just for browsing was awful. Just to click you have to click multiple times because it doesn't sense it right away and when it does it clicks on other things. I wanted to like this computer but it feels very cheaply made. I had to send it back after only two days. I never even got a chance to use for school because it is set up akward. I only checked emails. Not user friendly in my opinion. I was really disappointed with this purchase.",
"Espero que averiguen bien el modelo del procesador de esta computadora antes de hacer la compra, ya que en ningún lado dice que es de 1.20 Ghz como base de funcionamiento y que puede alcanzar los 3 Ghz en turbo bajo demanda. El vendedor nunca pone en el anuncio que es de 1.20 Ghz, sino que directamente, lo pone en 3 Ghz y eso hace que el comprador caiga en error, pensando en que compra un super procesador de 3 Ghz cuando no es así. No me quejo de la computadora, me ha salido buena pero el vendedor induce a error cuando no especifica bien la velocidad del procesador",
"Great customer service, the company went above and beyond to get the laptop delivered.",
"I really like this laptop.  It's lightweight, easy to use and does everything I want to do with it.  I miss not having touch screen like my old laptop, but after a short adjustment period I got use to not having it.  It has a clear picture and works very well.",
loved ok,
"I bought this laptop for my kid who is 5 yrs old. He is in love with it and so are we !!!! It’s very light weight, as long as he doesn’t take away its will be fine .",
"My old thinkpad was suffering from the video card starting to fail so I decided to take advantage and buy the ideapad after doing some comparison shopping.  For the value received, I got a fairly lightweight, easy to use and sturdy laptop computer.  Obviously, only time will tell but since I use this laptop for work as well as other stuff, it is nice.  Especially during these COVID times when I am working (when I can) from home.",
"I bought a few of these for my small nonprofit. Out of the box they feel a little flimsy and not as solid as I would have liked. They come with Windows 10 Home, so I had to buy the Pro suite for about $100 each computer. My fault for not reading thoroughly. The color is very aesthetically pleasing, and my users haven't had any problems with them. They were easy enough to set up and seem to work fine. Hoping they hold up over time.",
THIS COMPUTER IS FABULOUS. THE [RICE IS GREAT,
"Bought this for my girlfriend back in 2020 and I wanted to leave a review for it now. This was a perfect laptop for her first few years of college; she's a graphic design major so she was able to really test its limits. It was very easy for her to carry around in her bag to her classes. Performance-wise, it struggled a bit with more demanding programs like Source Film Maker and Photoshop but was still able to pull through in the end. The laptop showed signs of giving up after pushing it so hard with the programs her classes required, but she was able to trade it in for a new one in 2022. All in all, both of us were satisfied!",
I like the tablet itself but it does not have the charging adaptor in the box. It does worth the price. I would give 5 star if it had charger.,
I use this little tablet for games and reading books. It is a nice tablet for everyday use. I am very satisfied with it.,
Good quality,
Crashes when using graphically intensive apps.  Otherwise stable.,
Item arrived and seemed to be improperly packaged. My nephew used it for a day and then screen went black.  Disappointed to have waited so long to get it and then receive a defective item.,
I LOVE THIS 8' INCH SAMSUNG TAB E TABLET IT'S IN EXCELLENT CONDITION DOWNLOADING MOVIES FROM MY AMAZON LIBRARY NOW IT'S DOING WHAT IT'S SUPPOSE TOO DO. THANK YOU!!!!,
Does what I wanted it for,
go for a one finger typer but that is it,
So so happy,
"Delivered on time. The keys stuck and backspace didn't work.
It was renewed.
Returned",
"Good Chromebook, nice size screen with responsive touchscreen. Highly recommend!",
"Me gusto el Producto, Totalmente recomendado, llego en el plazo fijado, no tenia averias",
"I've just received this laptop in the mail. So far, everything is running smoothly. No complaints regarding the computer's software functionality. The physical qualities leave a little to be desired. There were a couple dings and dents in some of the metal exterior components. Also, whoever last had the keyboard and topside of the laptop disassembled, left a loose screw underneath the space bar beneath the keyboard. The button functions fine now, but clicking response and button recoil is a little mushy.

Besides those few complaints, the laptop is functioning as expected.",
"I must be the only person on the planet who's still using Vista after 14 years. I recently decided to upgrade to Windows 10 & bought this laptop. The system is frustratingly complicated (IMO) compared to Vista, which was easy for me. After many emails & a few phone calls back & forth with the seller, I've finally got it up & running although I still have a lot to learn. (There wasn't anything wrong with it, it's just that the whole system is so foreign to me.) It's pretty fast which is one thing I really like. I just need to get used to a whole new OS.",
"Sadly, I've been through two of these devices and arrived at the same results: Asus has not designed the entire device to meet the needs of the separate components and perform to expectations.

1. CPU is both underpowered at 80W PL2 vs Intel's required 115W to achieve 4.7Ghz AND under-cooled causing the processor package to reach 95C at a mere 4.2Ghz and throttle down to 3.8Ghz or lower each time due to poor cooling system thermodynamics. Meaning: as tested, this laptop performs in the bottom 8th percentile of all other laptops with the same CPU across more than 1000 tests.

2. The RAM is timed with a very high latency. As configured and tested, the LPDDR5 16GB memory package performs slower than 5 year old DDR4 memory. Samsung supports XMP 3 for their DDR5 with better timings and latency, but Asus has chosen to not implement to specifications again, resulting in poor memory performance.

3. The A370m GPU leaves much to be desired. In short, it will aid low demand creative applications but you can forget about 3D gaming and demanding creative suites.

Aside from that, the screen is beautiful and bright, SSD performance is up to mark, keyboard is nice for a laptop/notebook, and the battery is great.

In general, there are a handful of choices with the same or better specs that outperform this model. Asus has impressed us with the specifications but tricked us with the reality of experience and performance.

Buy something else...",
"No solo el producto es genial, la atención que tienen con los clientes es excelente, todo lo que solicite me lo dieron, sigan así.",
"For a working mom, this laptop was really great! It's fast, has a beautiful display and can handle multiple tasks easily. I was at first a bit nervous as this was my first laptop that wasn't a Dell, but this SGIN has held up and then some. I'd recommend this for those who want a nice, well-performing laptop for work or school.",
Food leftovers on the keyboards. A lot of scratches.,
The laptop turns off approximately every hour or two.,
"No hay ninguna queja con esta laptop, es ligera, muy bonita y potente. pero me enviaron el cargador incorrecto, lo que arruino un poco la experiencia de compra, por lo demás me encuentro satisfecho",
"Good shipping, nice laptop, quality purchase.",
"First red flag was that the wifi card was either disabled or inoperable since the only way I could complete set up was to connect with an RJ-45. Then after I got it through on a “limited” install. I still was unable to use wifi, the unit was stuck in airplane mode for some reason, and it would crash every 15-30 seconds making any attempt to re-install Windows futile. I wish my experience was similar to everyone else’s and I’ll try again but with an Intel chipset this time.My fault for trying
 something new I suppose.",
"Listing advertised a fingerprint scanner - component was not included. Otherwise the machine was in great shape.

*UPDATE*
The power cord that was supplied was definitely not OEM. It was a Frankenstein/splice job that failed just a few months later. I was so scared that yhe laptop or battery itself had failed but it turns out I just needed to replace the power cord.

All in all based on the lack of an advertised fingerprint scanner and the failing/Frankenstein power cord I am disappointed with my purchase. Would not recommend purchasing any refurbs from this company.",
"Great product! Arrived quickly. In excellent condition. Everything worked as new, not a scratch or dent in site.",
"Great value, condition was like new and no issues after using for a few weeks.",
I bought this to replace and old shop computer.  I paid just $350. Amazing value and speed for the money.,
"Es una pena que deje de funcionar, no enciende, ni siquiera el led indicador de carga, totalmente muerta, como la traje a otro país me resulta imposible devolverla, dinero perdido totalmente.
Es una lotería comprar este tipo de equipos, es mejor abstenerse si viven en otro país y no la pueden regresar.",
Very compact and lightweight. Quality Finish and excellent backlit keyboard.,
"No tiene el sensor de huellas dactilares o no funciona, aunque en la publicación lo indica que sí, revisé la bios de la computadora y no aparece, instalé drivers y nada a dado resultado, soy consiente que es un producto renovado pero debe explicase bien los detalles del mismo.... mal vendedor!",
Qué buen equipo. Estoy muy satisfecho.,
mine is climate pledge friendly so it wasnt fresh out the box but it does more than i can ask from it,
Good for price,
"I love buying refurbished computers.  For what I use a laptop, this works great.  Great AMD Ryzen 5, 16 Gb and M.2 SSD.  Bought a refurb desktop last year for my spouse and it’s performed well.  Just upgraded memory on it, just because.
I’ve not been disappointed buying refurbs from Amazon.",
"I bought this product based in the features that the seller offered, the price and also the seller rating. The stetic of the laptop is very good, looks like a new one. But since I bought this laptop every day i have 2 issues, the first is that the fingerprint reader don't work. the 2nd is that every day restart autocatically around 10 times, no matter what work i am doing (watching a video, writing or any other task) without previous notice, what is absolutelly annoing.",
"The laptop survived traveling halfway around the world. Thank you for packing it properly. It reached southeast asia safely.

At first i thought the laptop was D.O.A. It won't turn on. It turns out the battery was drained. Charging it fixed the problem. Windows estimate the battery will last for 8hrs. Under light use.

It came with windows 10 pro. Upgraded it to windows 11.

Everything works except for the finger print scanner. I should have tested it on windows 10 before upgrading to window 11. Even linux mint 21.2 can't detect any finger print scanner installed. But it is ok with me. Not planning to use it any way.

Physically i think it is great just a few ballpen marks. A little scuff near a usb port. The laptop also came with a skin or sticker behind the screen. The skin is brushed aluminium.

To access bios spam f10 on boot.

I'm really happy with my purchase.

edit
read the description. there are no finger print scanner. just a heads up to potential buyers if they are after the finger print scanner",
"This laptop was purchased to be a general purpose laptop for work and entertainment.  The 5600U and 16GB dual channel RAM handles older games well and newer games at low settings.  The aluminum frame gives it a nice, sturdy feel and the backlit keyboard is great for using at night.  14"" is the perfect size to keep it relatively compact and light.  There are plenty of ports including 3 USB-A, a USB-C and a RJ-45 jack.  Mine was in like-new condition with no signs of wear.  Mine came with an HP 65 Watt power supply.

I upgraded mine to Windows 11 Pro and switched out the storage for a 2TB intel M.2 card.  I also run this laptop connected to a Dell docking station with dual monitors and it works perfectly.  This laptop is priced at less than half what a new Pavilion or Envy will cost.  For the features it includes, (ports, aluminum construction, fingerprint reader, upgradeability) it's the best bang/buck.",
"I really do like this laptop. It was a very good deal for the money. However, the first one came and did not work at all. It kept shutting off and we were unable to get on the Wi-Fi. There was no sound either. I highly doubt they checked anything other than just wiping it clean. I emailed the seller as I was instructed, that was about a week and a half ago and I still haven’t heard anything. About day three of no reply from the seller I contacted Amazon directly. Very nice young lady who issued a new laptop immediately I still don’t understand why the seller never called me back or emailed me. I may or may not recommend.",
"Received this product today and cannot power it on.  According to the HP website, 9 or so white flashes when you try to power on indicate a broken power supply.  There is a reset for non-removeable battery type laptops from HP but that reset fails to work.  I tried to contact Amazon to just get a new power supply but there is no option since this ""comes from a third party seller"".  3 stars for not sending a fully working unit and not having any way other than going out and trying to buy another power supply to have a working system.",
"THE GOOD: This laptop is good at a great value. Battery life is great. Speed is nice haven't had it hang on me. It's lightweight and I am able to bring it with me to work anywhere.
THE BAD: The bottom left ctrl button on the keyboard was broken, every time I tried to copy and paste I would be left with v. I was confused thinking I kept missing the ctrl button. Contacted support and they offered to return the laptop, but since I already had all my security features and applications installed, and didn't want to bring it back to redo all of it.",
"I bought this laptop so I can demonstrate music software for the recent IMSTA Festa and AES shows in New York city. As opposed to bringing my desktop...lol.

This thing runs Windows 11 Pro and ran all of my music software with plugins smoothly. I even created a few beats with this machine. Great buy and another reason why I love HPs laptops.",
"The laptop comes (mine at least) with pre-installed Windows 10 21H2. This is an out of support version of Windows 10 and is out of service for a couple of months.
More than that, the OS comes with a dozen of HP drivers missing for critical devices like wifi card. This means that out of the box there will be no network/internet connection once the computer is turned on. Of course it still has a RJ45 port, but I am sure that 90% of people don't have wired network at home. So you will have to download the required driver from HP site to another computer, copy it to a flash drive and then install it from the flash drive on the laptop. You have no idea which exactly driver you will need because on HP site there is driver for Intel wifi card, for MediaTek card and for Qualcomm card. You will need to try all of them in order to find the correct one. Once installed successfully, you can finally connect the laptop to the internet and download all the missing drivers and Windows updates. Note that before updates for Windows are installed, the computer is vulnerable due to very old version used as mentioned above. Well, I installed Windows 11 and it, BTW, has built in driver for the wifi card used in this computer.

And now the real problem. The battery is really worn out. The spec suggests capacity of 45Wh, but the actual capacity is 36Wh. This means that the battery is 20% less than a new one. Dear seller, this is not what I call _fully functional, and in excellent condition_. This is not properly tested and definitely not in excellent condition. I personally would prefer a couple of scratches to a worn out battery.

The good: the laptop is lightweight, good size for a kid's school computer and the screen is acceptable.

Addition: despite the description, the laptop does not have fingerprint sensor. I see that this was already stated in other reviews, but the vendor did not even update the item description. [Palmface]",
"I was a little nervous buying refurbished, but the vendor had a good rating so I took a chance. So so so glad I did. It works perfectly, looked good cosmetically, and packs a lot of punch at a low price point.

Here was the only snaffu which I will solve for you here in case you get hit with it. First time setting up windows, it asks for your windows password - which is not your personal password. It will make you think it’s looking for an admin password and that you have to contact the refurbisher - but you don’t. There is no password. Leave it blank and hit enter as though you’ve put in a password.

Amazon refurbished support didn’t know that when I called them. I happened upon it while googling for a default windows password to try. The default password is no password at all.",
"I have used HP laptops for several years. I was looking for a replacement for a three year old model. A brand new version of what I got retails for around $1100. This refurbished unit was in perfect condition. It was supposed to have a fingerprint reader but I contacted the vendor and discovered that they had been misinformed. They rapidly rectified the issue in days with just a couple emails.

The computer itself was clean, the display is delightfully clear and bright. The AMD Ryzen CPU is more than twice as fast as the machine it replaces. It has run everything I need with plenty of headroom (typically running less than 6% CPU. The NvME SSD is blazing fast.) The 16 gigabytes of RAM is provided by two SoDIMM which allows dual-channel, interleaved access making it even a little faster. I've used it on an external monitor and gotten great 4K results at 60 Hertz. This was a great bargain. Plus, the vendor support was excellent.

I want to call out the specs on this again. AMD has an excellent line of CPUs and are comparable to Intel's latest generation. The construction of the ProBook follows the same frame design as the EliteBook which is the top of the line business machine, with fewer ports. It would be hard to match this for anywhere near this price. I've used other Amazon refurb products and been pleased at the value. Unless you're looking for the fastest gaming machine this will service any normal home or business user.",
"$350 (after taxes) for a Ryzen 5600U is a great price. The battery life also seems pretty decent at 6 hours when browsing on powersaving mode (2.5 hours otherwise). However, the fans, clock speeds, and voltages are locked so neither overclocking nor undervolting will be possible.

When stress-testing on Cinebench R15, the laptop's thermals are way too weak for sustaining the 4.1 Ghz CPU turbo (activates below 70 degree Celsius), but it's good enough to sustain the 3.2 Ghz turbo during which the CPU never exceeds 85 degrees. The Vega 7 integrated GPU is also good enough to run Sekiro on medium graphics, so I believe its got enough strength to run most games.",
Love this laptop. It’s fast and light. Totally recommend,

July 2023 update / Julio 2023 actualización
En Marzo/Abril aproximadamente la pantalla empezo a temblar/parpadear después de un momento de estar viendo videos en YouTube o jugando algún juego somo Sims. Instale siempre los últimos drivers de video y chipset, así como también actualice la Bios. El problema se iba por unos días pero luego volvía. Contacte al servicio de Asus que me dio unos drivers extra pero no resolvieron el problema. Restaure la notebook a valores de fábrica y tampoco. Ahora, actualicé la version de Windwos 11 Home a Pro y cambiar la frencuencia a 60hz. Sigo probando pero por ahora parece ""solucionado"".

Around March/April the screen started flickering/flashing after a moment of watching YouTube videos or playing a game like Sims. Always install the latest video drivers and chipset, as well as update the Bios. The problem would go away for a few days but then it came back. I contacted the Asus support service who gave me some extra drivers but they didn't solve the problem. I restored the notebook to factory settings and it did not work. Now, I updated the version of Windows 11 Home to Pro and change the frequency to 60hz. I keep trying but for now, it seems ""solved"".",
"La amo, es liviana, veloz, funcional.  Me encanta",
"Equipo muy lento, procesador 1.0 no sirve para hacer ni ofimatica, no lo recomiendo",
Said to have up to 9 hours of battery life. Lucky to get just under 2 hours. Used for personal use.,
Nice laptop,
Exactly what was advertised.,
Excelente producto a buen precio,
Overall a great product for the price,
Battery runs out quickly.,
Great product! The screen is crystal clear and grEat quality for the price.,
It’s fast and thin but the screen quality is horrible. I’ve tried to contact customer service and they’re useless. Can I return?,
Muy buena,
"I bought 2 of these laptops on March
None of them brought the Maxol Adapter mentioned in the description.
And the license of Microsoft Office is only for 30 days...",
"Este es un producto que se lo utiliza en casa para estudios y lo q más gusto es la resolución de la pantalla excelente imagen
Tiene un desempeño
Es ligera su teclado también lo es suave",
"I was looking for what I consider a MINIMUM specification for a Windows 10 laptop used for travelers:
At least 1920 x 1080 resolution
At least 14 inches diagonal display (15.6 inches even better)
At least 12GB, preferably 16GB, RAM
At least 512GB SSD
A modern CPU with at least 8000 benchmark rating.
At most 3-3.5 lbs
Good Service and Reliability
Ergonomic Keyboard

This unit fits the bill almost perfectly, except:
The display is not bright enough for use in high illumination
There is only 12GB of RAM - unchangeable
The screen size means that it is difficult to read unless you have tip top vision.

If money were no object, I would opt for the LG Gram 16 inch of this year; it has as many pixels as a typical 17 inch monitor, yet weighs UNDER 3 pounds, and has good battery life.  Reviewers have criticized its mediocre brightness but the sheer screen ""real estate"" and the feather light weight are the most important factors for a mobile laptop that's easy on the eyes.  However, models begin at around $1000, and progress up to $2000 ish.

Another option is the highly rated Dell XPS with hit UHD display.  However, the screen is so small (13.3"") that a presbyopic would need magnifying glasses to make out the letters and digits!",
"Nice performance, to be an entry model works very well for standard office tasks. More than a week using it and very satisfied so far, 512 GB SSD drive and 12G memory is good enough for what we needed.",
Seems like a good computer so far but the battery only lasts a couple of hours-- Update! Was a great computer for 2 1/2 years of light use -then the motherboard crapped out - $600 is too much to pay for 2 1/2  years.,
"I got this for school and I love it! It is very light,  responsive, and fast. My sister will be getting one for herself with a larger screen.",
"Haven't found anything to dislike yet.  The laptop is light and thin.  Big improvement over my old laptop.  I like that it is solid state.  Faster than the old Dell.  Could use a lighted key board, but that is not a deal killer.",
"So this computer is perfect for someone like me who uses it primarily for work and very little for play. It's my first with a solid state drive (SSD). Much quicker than my old Sony Vaio with the old outdated hard drive, which was a $1,200 flagship model approaching 10 years old. SSD uses less energy because it has no moving parts and is more suited for the bumpy life of a laptop. This also has wicked fast 3.2 USB ports. About 10x faster when using jump drives that are rated 3.0 or above. This means I an easily use an external drive without the lag if I need more memory in the future. I see some complained in the reviews about the screen quality. Keep in mind this is an anti-glare sceen. If you are not familiar with this type of screen expect something different. They do look different and are easier on the eyes when working for long periods of time. If you are use to bright crisp screens and eye strain, look elsewhere. This screen also has some privacy qualities because it's harder to see from the side. Another plus is there is are no preinstalled obnoxious programs. Does have a week long trial for windows 365. There is no fingerprint scan. Had some issues with the last one so I see fingerprint readers as one more thing to malfunction while trying access your computer. No touchscreen. Almost never used it on my Vaio. I use the voice commands more. One thing I would like to have seen is a USB C connection, the reason why I knocked it down a star. USB C is the future and Lenovo dropped the ball big time on this one. Has one port for a regular 2.0 USB, two 3.2 USBs (souch faster), HDMI, a card reader, and a headset/microphone jack. The internet connection via wifi is great. Bluetooth also works great as I use it for an external speaker. The speakers on the computer are a little disappointing. Okay for regular function, not great for music. With a 12 gig ram and a solid state drive there is no lag with data transfers and it starts up quickly. Haven't fully tested the battery, but it lasted 5 hours on my last use. This is a nice computer with up to date drive technology and no fluff that I wouldn't use anyway.",
It doesn't last even 2 hours if unplugged. It claims 9 hours of battery life.,
"I love it! It's incredibly fast given its 12Gb RAM! Its screen quality is so good that I want to watch Netflix on it instead of my TV. I use it for work and it has been absolutely great. The battery lasts a lot.
It doesn't have touch screen but for me it's perfect, because I didn't want it with touch screen
The only downside for me is that there's no option to include office with it, so you have to do the installation on your own",
"I absolutely love this computer.  It is light weight and took no time in setting up.  If you do your settings for privacy and not sync with other devices, if not needed, it really helps with speed and connection with internet.  Either or, it still is very, very fast.  It sits perfectly on my lap unlike other laptops I have had that were too bulky and very heavy.  I feel happy and satisfied, knowing I can get online with a reliable computer.  I waited a few weeks before rating, definitely 5 star for me.
Great product.",
"My KIndle Fire 8.9"" is easier to use, especially when I generally use Amazon for everything. The screen is very nice,though. Probably the best.",
Shipped quickly - battery charge is slowly losing - have to charge all the time and only lasts less than an hour!!,
"Better screen than any other tablet - period. It's awesome that it takes MicroSD too - means I can review GoPro footage and my still camera's photos on the fly, on a big screen, even in daylight. Superbly light and easy to hold. Software is Android, which takes getting used to but is very capable.",
"Great tablet with out standing screen display quality. Compared it to iPad and it blows it away. Unlike the iPad and other apple products, you do not have to put in your credit card info just to get access to hundreds of thousands of free apps. Invest in this tablet you will be happy you did.",
after a year started to show problems,
"I had been wanting one of these for a while. Caught this one in the open box area of amazon for just a little over $200. You could tell the box had been opened, but all accessories are there and it looks brand new. So far I love it. Writing this review on it.",
I purchased this to replace my galaxy note 8 that suddenly stopped working. I've mostly used it to play games and check my email. It's okay and does the job but there are still some more things I have to learn to use it to the fullest potential. I really love the screen.,
"This tablet is ok, but am disappointed that Samsung loads it with a bunch of apps that I would not use. There is so much pre-loaded garbage that can not be deleted. I use it for playing games and looking at FaceBook. I wish I would have waited and gotten an IPad.",
Everything about this tab is great and beautiful except the occasional lag and clunky user experience. The smooth and seemless user interface is the only thing I miss about apple.,
"Excellent tablet to follow up my Galaxy Note 8.0. Beautiful screen, very responsive, additional memory is halpful (3gb as I recall).  The only odd thing is that pressing app buttons sometimes moves the screen instead of starting the app.  You can't be at all sloppy with pushing straight down.  My Note 8.0 was not as sensitive in that regard.",
"Great tablets but chargers (travel adapter part) were non-functional.  Had to use charger from a phone.  In response to inquiry, vendor indicated that they would send chargers (hopefully that work).",
Other than the green hue at the top of the screen. It's a really nice tablet. You can't see the hue as much if you turn the brightness ask the way up.,
"This will not be a techie review, there's enough of those out there already.  What I will say about this Tab is that it is quite possibly the best tablet device in its class!  Fast! Brilliant! Extremely light! Beautiful! Stereo Speakers! Expandable storage! Nothing else compares.

If I were you, I'd get a Samsung Tab S 8.4! Really!  I would!",
"I bought this tablet as a Father's Day gift and he loves it! It's the perfect size, and very lightweight. Swiping through the device is smooth and quick. Best price I've seen it at the time of purchase and is really worth the cost. I did my research, like I do with all my products.  You get your money's worth with this tablet.",
"We purchased two of these. One for me and one for my wife. We really like them. However we are using them for personal use and I can't rate it for high end business use, but they sure meet our needs. So much better than firing up the lap top. It is rapidly becoming obsolete. The is way faster and easier to use.",
Great device for browsing Internet and reading books. Same size as iPad mini and screen is just as good. Going from apple products to android is a bit tough at first with the difference in OS.,
"Nice tablet overall, however I have experienced the following problems:

1) The space bar does not work sometimes, causing whatever I type to lack spaces.
2) The tablet has started to randomly reboot, sometimes several times per day.

Due to these issues, and no clear resolution from Samsung, I would not buy another Samsung tablet.",
"Love it, got this to replace my old first gen nexus 7 after it got so slow i couldn't stand to use it. This works great only wish it didn't have so much bloatware, and that I could move things onto the SD card without it telling me I have set something up first. Other than that it works wonderfully, love the fingerprint scanner.",
"This is a top tier tablet, but buying it refurbished wasn't the best. There was small scratch on back that seller didn't say anything about and the battery isn't the best anymore. Other than that, awesome tablet.",
"I love it!!! My husband bought this for me as a Birthday/ Christmas gift. It is a perfect size and I love the white. I'm glad I got the 8.4"". This is big
enough. I thought I wanted the 10"" but that is much bigger. I love this because I can slide it right into my purse with no problem.
I also love Samsung Galaxy products......",
"I reviewed and researched for months before finally buying 2 of these (in the white of course because who wants doo doo brown?). I now know I'm a genius, as we use these so hard you'd think they owe us money. No problems, no glitches, and my GAWD what beautiful images. I love Apple products but this tablet just surpasses Apple iPads by a mile in every aspect.",
"If you are looking for feature pack. You have to get one of these. I went online to youtube to get the rundown on this tablet. the amount of features on this baby just blew me away.. Looking for a tablet, Get this one.By the way, order a 32 or a 64 GB micro SD Card to go with this, and you are ready for the good times.",
"This was supposed to be a premium tablet. Yet, it is impossible to hold it, either in portrait or landscape, without accidentally touching the screen or the physical home/back/task buttons. If you hold it in portrait, the edges available for you to hold is so tiny that you touch the screen all the time. If you hold it in landscape, you will keep pressing the back button accidentally.

The multiple-window feature is marginally useful. But having it activated by a in-bound swipe from the right edge is simply crazy. There are so many apps who use the same gesture to turn pages. I have to disable this feature immediately.

And I expected a tablet with 1.9GHz quadcore cpu to be fast and smooth. On the contrary, it's not fast at all when I scroll between pages of my kindle ebooks. Much slower than my nexus 5 cell phone.

The only thing nice about it is the screen. But if you can't hold it properly,what is the use of it?",
Love it. I have almost ever tablet there is even the Samsung Galaxy 10.1 2014 edition. I wanted something smaller because the iPad mini I have is complete junk. This was just the right tablet not to big but not to small. I can take it everywhere. Apple will never get my business again I will stay with Samsung products.  This is just what I needed and wanted.,
"I love this tablet. Awesome screen resolution. My only problem was that the seller sent the wrong color. I wanted Dazzling white but received Titanium Bronze. The box had 3 labels on it with both colors on them. Too bad no one bothered to look in the box and check the color. This is a used item so I expected something might be wrong, but not he color. I'm keeping it.",
"Fast, great screen resolution, it's a thousand times better than my old nexus 10. It's super light and I would recommend to anyone who is looking for a quality tablet. Truly my only Complaint is that there is a screen to the left on the home screen that I can't get rid of. I've looked everywhere online for a way to disable that screen and I can't find anything. It's easy to ignore though.",
"You probably saw this in best buy and thought wow what an amazing screen!  Well that's true.  However the tablet feels very sluggish to me.  I don't know if it is due to the ram or cpu but things just feel slow in general.  Next time, I'll focus on performance instead of looks.  The tablet is a nice size though and I love the white color.",
"AMOLED Screen is amazing, the power in this tablet is insane, I wish it included more internal memory, but that's ok. I am able to do just about everything with this, The camera is the only downside, only 8 megapixels, and it feels like it's very fragile due to the new super slim form.

The only negative for me so far is the gold around the outside, sides. I'd have preferred silver or white metal.",
"I usually love my amazon purchases. This is the first time, I've seen a sign of issues. Product looked great, delivery was great,...however, now I'm noticing that at times when I turn it on it fades n and out slightly, looking as if it wants to turn off and is somewhat unresponsive. I'm regretting now that I didn't buy it new.",
"This is the best tablet I've ever used. I mainly bought this for media consumption and let me tell you, the picture quality is ridiculous. I can't compare it to anything because it would blow any other tablet out of the water. This puts my iPad Air 2 to shame and then some (in terms of picture quality, at least).

So clear, so beautiful. Looks better than real life does. 5* for this product and 5* for Amazon's same-day shipping!",
"I had the 7"" for 2 years before the battery finally died. I thought I'd enjoy the bigger screen of this 8.4"", but it just doesn't fit in my grasp. It's thinner as well, which makes it very hard to hold on to. The graphics are outstanding, however.",
This is my first tablet.  I do have an older Kindle Fire but I felt I needed something that did a little more.  This is an amazing tablet.  I am still setting it up and getting used to it and have not used all of the features.  The only complaint I have is I seem to be charging the battery a lot.  I am sure once I get used to it and know why the battery gets low I can fix that.,
"best tab in the market  (end of 2014). no comparison to others. processor is lightning fast. the screen is amazing. bright colors, beautiful resolution and the size is just perfect, not too clumsy and hard to handle as the 10 and not so small as the 7. pixel density is gorgeous. the golden binding on the side and the thin design makes it very elegantly looking and cool to handle, also good for sharing videos with a couple of your friends. look no further, this tab is superior.",
"I bought this product last year before my freshman year at college, it worked amazing for everything that I had.. I used it for eTextbooks and even wrote my papers on it. But this past week, it stopped working.. I put it on the charger and came back 30 minutes later to use it only to have a tablet that would not turn on or reset- Nothing! Sucks that I have to purchase a new tablet after only having this one for a year.",
"I am completely happy with my tablet.  I bought it mainly to put books on to read while traveling.  However, in the meantime, I have started using it to read magazines that I can access through my public library (the reading experience is actually better on the tablet than on my laptop).  The screen is incredibly crisp and easy to read.  I used the Internet to get tips on using an Android tablet (it is pretty much the same as my cell phone).",
I got it to use for my drone but it was not compatible to the app,
"UPDATE:
The battery takes 12 hours to fully charge from a start of about 5% left.
I have returned the device and am considering the Apple mini.

Now this is what a tablet should be. Unbelievable screen clarity, Very, very fast. Sidesnyc allows me to connect directly to my Galaxy Note 3 and even make phone calls from the tablet. I can see and use everything on my phone from the tablet. And did I say how incredibly fast it is? Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful. You will not be disappointed if you buy this machine..",
"I have a few technical glitches every once in awhile but I guess that's part of owning an Android, this tablet is much better than the Galaxy Tab 4 which is the cheaper model of this I enjoyed the fingerprint scanner as long as Android 5.0 and everything and has to offer",
"I've had it four weeks now. It's a great tablet. One issue, the 128GB  mini SD card sometimes drops out and in. I've always gotten it to work w/o much trouble, but wonder how long it'll work right. (Just pushing on the tiny mini-SD door.) Found that others have had worse problems on web.",
LOVE IT!  I have been using it for three days and haven't had any issues with it.  The initial charge lasted almost two days even playing games and music.  I have a windows phone and I regretted not getting an android.  This Samsung Galaxy S 8.4 makes up for my app-deprived Windows cell phone in so many ways.  It seems to come with a lot of similar or duplicate type of apps though with just a few minutes time those extras are easily removed.  I would recommend to anyone.,
"Great Tablet.
Internal memory is low. Good thing there is the Micro SD card slot to counter that.
The only thing I have not been a fan of so far is that Hangouts and FB messenger send notifications to the tablet and not my phone, even when the tablet is in standby mode.
Otherwise a great tablet",
"This replaced the original Nexus 7 (2012) and I am very happy with it. The quality of the screen is amazing, speed is good, as is the battery life.

One point deducted for the pervasive and intrusive Samsung bloatware, especially with its intrusive updates (this unfortunately also goes for the Galaxy S6). I see no reason to upgrade to the (upcoming) S2",
"Excellent bright screen and it was easy for me to set up. I downloaded the Manual to my PC so I was able to read and follow the instructions.
This Tab replaces my 5 year old Toshiba Tab and is a tremendous improvement over the 5 year old technology.  The Tab S 8.4 I have is WiFi only which meets my needs.  My wife's Tab is a Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 8.0 that is WiFi and Wireless. Between the 2 Tabs and 2 Samsung S4 Smartphones we have just about everything covered.",
"I love everything about this tablet. I have reviewed a lot of tablets and this is the best one with all the features I was looking for. Great resolution awesome and clear pictures which was huge in my decision to go with this tablet. I bought this tablet refurbished and it works the same as if I bought it brand new, no scratches or scuff marks so I made a good decision in buying the refurbished one opposed to the brand new one which cost more. Great seller came sooner than the delivery date.",
"I am soooo bummed. Bought my tablet Jan 15, 15 - always took care of it, well it did yesterday 6 months later!!!  Paid a lot of Money  and just died!  The kindle is cheaper and lasted longer......
  Ok, thank goodness my beautiful  daughter  works for major cell phone company
y that sells them, she got it fixed, I don't know what
it was or why it shut down like that!  Just glad she got it fixed as it's my lifeline  other than this issue I love my tablet, it's my second one...",
"This is a great tablet!
I initially bought it to watch Movies when I fly.  I have been using legal pads for business notes for ever.  The only issue is that when I need notes made 6 month's earlier, it is a pain to find them.
I decided to try the Tab S as a note taker.  It works great!
Now I take notes during meetings, conf. calls, save them as word docx on the tablet and upload them to my drop box.  Huge bonus!!!
Oh yea, it is also great to watch movies on.",
"I owned this miracle already 10 day and very exsiting!!!!  everyone knows about pros of this tablet, i did my best  to find cons and thinck found some:
-unusefull samsung junk soft which i never use.

-a little bit low speaker sound.
-front camera s 2.1 mp, could be better
-back camera in the center not good idea, tab pro has got it in the corner.
If you choose between this tab and ipad, take this,  wont regret!
Update! 07.25.2015  after 6 month usage battary failed!  So, if i let the battary drain under 50%, it is restarting itself.((  on ebay battary is 23$. Going to buy soon",
"Probably the best screen I've seen, and this tablet is the perfect size for my purposes. My biggest issue was with the bloatware that Samsung puts on their products, most of which I don't need or use, but it still sucks up battery in the background, etc. However, after installing Nova Launcher to replace the TouchWiz interface, I was much, much happier. Still not happy about the battery life, but that's the price of a high-density, bright screen.",
"Great tablet with ano incredible display. Don't listen to the gripes about over-saturation. Isn't that the point of a higher resolution screen? Easy to navigate if you're familiar with android. But the vast options for customized settings can take some time to figure out. I Would rate 5 stars if the battery life was longer and it had more internal memory. I had to upgrade via SD card. A bit pricey for 16G, but most tablets are overpriced anyway.",
"The Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4 Tablet....Is awesome the picture is 4k with all the pixels,imoled picture,sharp,I boemught this for my daughter I already own two of them from Amazon.com,This Tablet is the best out,apples retina displace can't even come close to this tablet by far this is the best tablet on the market,our family loves the Android market.....We also love all of you at Amazon,To everyone reading this I made this review on my own I don't get paid I stand by this tablet and the Tru commitment and excellence of Amazon.com",
"I love this tablet! I got it refurbished and it came looking and working brand new! It upgraded to Android 6 the first day!  I've had it 6 months now and I use it heavily every day, no problems! Battery life is great! Runs my favorite program like a dream, JW.lib! Sound is awesome! I use it outdoors all the time and can hear everything perfectly! It's lite, thin and fits in a purse just fine! I got a otterbox for more protection and it's still very lite!",
"I have a galaxy 10.5 , find it a little difficult to carry around, so I was looking for a 8.4 size to walk around with but not too expensive so I got galaxy pro (refurbished ) it was cheaper but disappointed with the performance, so I end up spending 140.00 more for this new galaxy s 8.4, if there was a 10 star rating I would give it that, it has all the great features as my 10.5 but in a mini version, finger print scanner, multi apps use, 3gigs ram, octa core processor, very thin and light and faster than most high end tablets out there, highly recommended.",
"I love this thing! Perfect size! The screen quality is beautiful! I've been using it almost a month now, and I am still blown away by the vibrant colors and the vivid picture. There is a lot of bloatware, and most of it is completely unnecessary.

The best feature of this tablet, is that when you want to uninstall an app, you can do it from the app screen by dragging it to the top! You don't have to go into the app store to uninstall something. Coming from older generation tablets, this is a HUGE convenience for me!

Overall, this is my favorite tablet I've ever used!",
"Love it!  Quick shipment by Amazon.  Only had a few days, but so far love it.  Was able to update system to the latest Android 6.0 Marshmellow.  This table is fast and the colors are vibrant.  It is very easy to use and fits nicely in your hand...I have very small hands.  Once logged into my Samsung account, all my apps were automatically moved from my old tablet to my new...this is a nice feature, real time saver.  I will write more once I've had it for a while.",
Garbage. Pure Garbage. I can't give it a 1 star because it does do some of what it's suppose to do. But the crummy piece of crap is glitchy af. It's a powerful tablet. Unfortunately the damn thing has a pretty annoying glitch. I looked it up online and apparently a few of these tablets have faulty wiring in the battery When it's not fully charged (or charging) it tends to flicker and then freeze and then restart. I didn't think much of it at first (I'm pretty thick skinned and patient) but it soon became INCREDIBLY annoying. It had gotten to the point where I had to leave the thing charged 24/7 or else it would flicker and then freeze and then restart. I highly suggest you invest in the Galaxy Tab 4 8 inch. It works just the same and the battery isn't all the way bad. This tablet isn't worth +200 dollars. It isn't even worth the metal it took to make it.,
"This was previously a 5-star review.  However, after 5 months of ownership, my opinions have changed.  The tablet  itself is still a great tablet.  I hated Touch Wiz, so I downloaded Google Now launcher, which is a big improvement. The battery life, however, is the achilles heel of this tablet.  If I use the tablet fairly regularly, I only get 3-4 hours out of the charge.  For example, today after playing a game for 30 minutes (Two Dots), the battery went from fully charged to 70%.  I was down to 7% by noon (3.5 hours of use).  Having had Nexus 7 2012 and 2013 versions, both of which had decent batteries, this is unacceptable.  As far as settings, the battery software says that the screen is using 50% of my juice.  However, I have it set on automatic, which keeps brightness to a minimum.

If I could go back, I would NOT purchase this tablet.  I would instead have waited for Nexus 9, or, Heaven forbid, purchased an Ipad Air2.",
"Better than I had hoped for. Fast, great color, compact and intuitive. I am an Android person. Within minutes of turning it on the first time all my apps were there. It was as though I had been using it for years. The split screen is very helpful. Often I need to look up a contact and being able to open my contacts and search, while still in the previous program, priceless. I take it everywhere now. Battery life seems to be excellent. I do not use it constantly, but, when using it for an hour or so the remaining battery life percentate does not seem to go down too much. It does seem to take as long to charge as discharge though.",
I bought this as a replacement for my son's Galaxy Tab 3. It is much thinner and a larger screen. The screen is vibrant. He plays a lot of games and YouTube and the battery has a pretty good life per charge.,
"Not the best for watching motion pictures. The display is grainy and yellow. I have the android lollipop update.
I agree that tab s is nice browsing, pictures and reading. Pictures on the Internet or apps are so crisp clear on the tab s. But watching movies especially HD MOVIES is annoying. Not pleasant a all.
compare with the Samsung galaxy tab pro 8.4. That tablet is the best, I have bought the tab S two different times, I still return it for the tab pro.",
"I am impressed.  The screen is outstanding.  Out of all the tablets I use this one has the best display.  Better than my iPad which was the
Previous best.  The tablet is thin and light.  The Samsung apps are ok, and I don't mind the user interface.  There are a lot of apps I won't use and I am slowly removing them from the tablet.  I did root the device to gain access to the SD card and built in apps.  I can recommend this tablet.",
"I have only had the Tab S for a few days and I am completely blown away by the stereo speakers on this device.  Watching a movie you can really hear the different speakers coming to life.  Not to mention the beautiful quality of the colors on the screen.  I have a Asus 10.5 tab with windows and I never use it.  I hate Windows 8.  Samsung Tab S gets the job done without all the hassle. Great size for carrying in my purse.  Also like that it will pair with my Bose mini speaker, by Cadillac Cue and also pairs nicely with my Samsung Note 3.  Great little tablet.  I have no qualms about recommending it highly.",
"What a joy it is to look at this screen. With 120 gigs at the sd slot there is enough room for tons of media. With the bloatware frozen and large apps moved to the sd card (requires some extra modification) this tablet is just incredibe. Be aware that leaving the wifi on all the time with a bunch of apps running will drain the battery fairly quickly when in standby. If you stay away from running power hungry apps (battery monitors, cleaners, security, ect) (fairly useless besides periodic cleaning) and set the wifi to only work when the tablet is on, the battery will last a lot longer. Awesome product with the power to smoothly run so many functions. Tablets are really becoming very useful in so many ways.",
"This is one outstanding tablet.  It is expensive, but it is hands down the best 8 inch table around.  The screen is bright with the OLED display that reproduces a wide range of color even in daylight.  Pages and application load with outstanding speed.  Web browsing is fast with pages loading quickly. Speakers on the side sound great, but would be better if they were front facing.  Watching videos is great, with no stuttering even watching MKV format.
I would certainly recommend this tablet for anyone who is looking for a tablet with a beautiful display, excellent response and easy of use.  It is small enough to fit right into a coat pocket or purse and will last all day for all apps.",
"Awesome little tablet for every day use for surfing and reading.  I downloaded the Nook and Kindle aps and love to read on this device.  It is the perfect size for all my purses so I take it everywhere.  I would not hesitate to buy it!  Samsung makes very high quality devices.
UPDATE - this is still going strong after more than 3 years!  Just running out of memory - damn aps take up more and more.  Play movies and musicy flawlessly - great video resolution etc.  Put a 64 GB chip in it and it has been awesome.  Good starter tablet if you can find one.  I will sadly have to update for more internal memory soon.",
"Good size and I love the screen!

Update, the battery sucks, it will run down very rapidly then shut off the device, BUT, if you pick it up a minute later and turn it on it will start and show a random battery percentage, like 45%. Then it runs down real quick again and does the same thing, this time the battery will be, say 29%, this goes on until the battery is very low, like 2% and it will run a long time at that low level. Very inconsistent, I use this for my alarm clock, but I can't trust it like this, and it's very annoying when it shuts off in the middle of a game!!
I can buy a replacement battery kit, but it's $65.00. Kinda high when this is less than 6 months old!!",
"Nice tablet in looks, the problem is, can't download anything.
Google play stops..ssl certificate errors..etc.
Been on the internet for three hours trying to fix it, no go.
My Fire Tablet configured fast and easy.
If you know the in's and out's of tablets, may be a good tablet.
If not, I recommend a Fire Tablet.",
"It's just okay. Speed is okay, it does lag at times, but not frequently enough to be annoying. What is annoying is the wifi will lose connection every few days and we have to restart the tablet. Keep in mind we have iPads, a Windows tablet, a Macbook, and two iPhones that connect and reconnect to wifi with no problems. So I do not believe this problem to be related to our router, but rather the tablet.  The other annoyance are the touch buttons at the bottom. Fine with holding it in portrait mode, but turn it to landscape and unless you're super careful you'll be hitting those buttons. Especially if you have any younger kids using the tablet, it is practically unusable in landscape mode for younger kids, and challenging for older kids and adults.",
"I needed to replace my aging 7"" tablet, and online reviews repeatedly showed this tablet as the most top-quality option for a tablet in that size range. Having set up my tablet and traveling with it for a week (I'm a road warrior), I agree 100%. The tablet's AMOLED display is amazing, and the camera is capturing great photos and videos. It's lightweight, very thin, and has the ability for me to add on a smart card to increase the 16GB hard drive space if that proves necessary in the future. Using it for reading and watching videos and movies in tight airplane seats and while waiting for flights is fantastic. This tablet has every option I wanted for my portable tablet - I'm very satisfied.",
"I bought this Samsung Galaxy tab S 8.4 on amazon sold refurbished by Vipoutlet. It looks and acts like brand new. I own Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 inch which I bought new. This new to me smaller Tab S is just a good if not better. It's super quick and the picture is amazing! Some video even looks 3D it's awesome, it's also a lot lighter than my 10 inch which is nice. The seller is good and product arrived faster than expected. With all this said I will see how it holds up over time. I have a feeling it was a open box barely used if at all tablet.",
"Folks, Had this device for just over 1 Mo. Just off chat with Samsung Tech support because I could not power down the device. The power down issue is not the real problem, but rather the use of Chromecast to control and cast Youtube clips to a TV. Samsung rep reported to me that ""Chromecast is not compatible with your device"". Bummed isnt the word I'd like to use. Would be 5 stars without that issue. If you dont want to use Chromecast, you can prolly be satisified with this device. It is responsive and light enough for me and I am somewhat of a geek. The battery capactity and weight tradeoffs seem ideal. You can google the chromecast issue for this device as a Google search. It is common enough. Earlier, folks report that Samsung said it was a Google issue.  Now I was told that it is simply not compatible.  Good thing to find out after the purchase ???",
"I was torn between this and the iPad mini.  I have an ipad and a Samsung s5 so I was familiar with both.  I chose this.  I love the size.  It is super crisp,  good battery life and love that I can add a card to store movies etc.  My iPad is so full at 32gb that I have to delete apps to make room for one movie.  I'm not even sure what's taking up all the space since I have no pictures,  music or movies on it.  I think it's all the apple updates.  Try an android. You won't be disappointed.  There is a learning curve if you are used to the simplicity of Apple, but you can do so much more with it.  Especially if you like to customize how it looks etc.",
"Fantastic tablet, has a ton of customization and cab easily connect to all of your other daily electronics making life pretty easy. It's perfect size to take out and about, I can fit it in all but 2 or 3 pairs of pants/shorts I own so it's almost like a super sized phone for me. It's excellent for movies/youtube/Netflix wherever and whenever. There aren't any real draw backs I can find personally. Does everything I need it to, and then some. It's connected to my laptop so I can copy music or files over to my tablet for on the go and can help me use my phone or find it if I'm too lazy to search for it, compliments my note 4 like a champion, side note, this was the First tablet and Samsung device I've ever bought and it converted me over night into getting the phone as well",
"It's not overall better than the Note 8.0 that I owned. Specs and speed are better. I used the S-pen, but oh well. Touchwiz, meh.  One maddening error made by Samsung is the fact the tablet won't stop going into store 'demo' mode.  Checking the forums, other tablet owners are experiencing the same thing. I think this is the major draw on the  crappiest battery life, cause the demo does its thing generally ignoring your settings. Being constantly reminded of how great the screen is is like the tablet screaming 'marco-polo' every time you put it down!  Unless you put the tablet in battery saving mode, which is an extra step each time you put it down, which means you have to take it out the 'mode' each time also. The tablet tends to hiccup as it goes back to full function  I am hoping the android 5.0 upgrade takes care of this issue.  I will continue to check the forums...until then.",
"I feel like the screen resolution is too high for the CPU/GPU to drive. It's very laggy with screen animations. However, games seem to run fluidly so I can't complain about that too much.

What can I say, it's a tablet, it does tablety things, the screen is pretty. It slows down a lot with more than a handful of applications running so I frequently find myself closing all the apps. Battery life is pretty good. Wifi seems stable and consistent. I filled up the 16GB quickly. I'm not sure why they even offer 16GB anymore. Minimum should be 32GB in my opinion. I added a 64GB SD card but can't move enough apps over to free up much space. I'm sure I'll max out pretty soon with many more apps. I guess I'll just have to delete some stuff (it's not like I use every app all the time, but it would be nice to have all my apps all the time). Overall, it's not bad, I don't know that I would but it again. It needs polish as far as performance.",
"The super AMOLED display looks really bad. That is why I never got a Samsung phone. The saturation totally ruined the whole device. I cannot even stand to use my tablet. The Samsung Galaxy tab pro 8.4 display is the best.
I have both and to tell you the truth, $360 for the Tab S is not worth it. The technical difference is not worth the extra $160 in Comparison to the Tab pro $199 value. (FYI: this was my lucky sale price of the brand new devices. I got Tab S from amazon prime, Tab pro from best buy)
-The Tab S is just a marketing scam. The processor is a lot slower (this is coming from an actual user of both devices. I am not a product reviewer).
-It takes a tad longer to open an app, a lot longer to download apps and watch videos on tab S.
-You cannot even Enjoy the display of videos and pictures because of the AMOLED display. Everything looks fake. It is like using windows 1998.
-The WiFi connection is really bad. It seizes At random.
-copy and paste does not work properly. Sometimes you copy a text, but it pastes an empty text.
- it takes longer to charge the battery
-the battery life does not last long at all.

If you really want to enjoy the fullness of a good tablet, just buy samsung galaxy tab pro 8.4. You will not regret it. That is the best tablet so far. The resolution is superb. And everything works great in comparison to any tablet out there.",
"Having a Note II i always wanted a tablet with the same screen and this is it. Nothing technical i can say that hasn't been said by more knowledgeable tech people. The only downside i found (for me) is the bloatware you can,t remove  and the lack of an Amazon Prime app for android.  For that i must keep the ipad mini.  With that screen it would be fantastic.
But if you want to transfer old pictures from pre digital era, they show very badly, or an old video from tape. Forget it. It didnt use to happen with other tablets. Must be it doesn't ""translate"" well to amoled.
Put a 128 gb card, downloaded tons of things for long flights. Being so thin and light is a joy to use and carry. Very happy with it.",
"i have been using the tablet for the past 8 months, and it was excellent, except for the battery life. but overall it is a nice tablet, and easy to use (i am also an ipad/ iphone user). i am not using it for heavy usage, just for reading from kindle, school and office stuffs, and the internet. but now, the problem occurred when it is constantly keep on rebooting. i did the factory reset, did the master reset and also clearing the caches. i even do not backup any files, in fear that some of the files contains viruses. but, it keep on rebooting and  i cannot do anything with it.

i sent email to the customer support, and they suggested me to send it back to them or go to the nearest Best Buy, with a promise to replace/ repair it if the problem is from their end. hopefully they will honor the promise. now waiting for them to provide me reference ID, for me to send it to Best Buy.

will updates later on the specific problem and how the customer support deals with it",
"This Samsung replaced my Asus Transformer that had ""issues"".  It still works sometimes but my husband was tired of me yelling at it and threatening to throw it out.  I wanted a smaller tablet that was reader friendly since I read a lot in bed and a 10"" tablet is a little too big.  The display is fabulous to say the least and I love how the keyboard suggests words when I am typing.  I'm of the ""older"" generation and was concerned about transferring my photos from the Asus but the Galaxy did that and all my games automatically, something I was thrilled with. I don't need a lot of memory since I still have a laptop so 16GB is quite enough plus having the ability to add an SD card increases my options.  I bought a nice case and a bag so I can take my tablet wherever I go.  All in all I am very happy and  my husband is happy too.",
"I know I'm just tooting the horn that Samsung wants... but... the display on this thing is out of this world amazing.  I've had it for almost a month, and I still like watching the 4K sample video that comes preloaded just because its so stinking pretty.

Other than the gorgeous display... this thing is a feather in size and weight.  It blows the iPad mini out of the water in how light and comfy it feels.  Much easier to hold in one hand as well.

It's lightning fast at anything I've tried to run with it, all the way up to 4K video.

And because its such an important feature to me... I have to state that I LOVE the microSD card slot... I added 64BG of memory to mine and have all the space I think I could want.

It took a little getting used to the ""Menu"" button being gone and being replaced with the ""recent apps"" button.  However, after a slight adjustment... I'm finding that in general I like it better.",
"This tablet was bought as a gift from a loved one.  I have been thrilled with it, a fabulous device.  However,  recently,  it has started to show the ""black screen of death"" without any warning.  Once this happens the entire tablet is frozen and I can't even restart it. This is happening more and more frequently.  Apparently I cannot request a replacement for this 8 month old tablet, nor can I afford to pay to replace it.  It's never been dropped,  has been extremely well taken care of.  To say that I'm devastated that a quality product from Samsung is showing performance issues at such an early stage would be an understatement.  I honestly don't know what to do.  I  believe that for the price we paid I deserve to have it replaced,  but I doubt that will occur.",
"I got a refurbished one back in 2014, had to return it because it kept shutting down and restarting the moment it arrived in the mail. I was really excited to own this item because I did my research at the time and I wanted a tablet that wasn't too small or too big, thin & can fit in my purse as well as a rectangle not a square. I wanted it to be the size of a page in a normal size textbook because I was still at University at the time. The 7in. was too small for my needs and the 10in+ was too big.

HOWEVER, I purchased a new one at Walmart in November 2014 nearing the thanksgiving sales so I got quite the discount on it. I have to say that product-wise, I love my tablet and it's going to be almost 2 years since I initially purchased mine. I highly enjoy mine and I can't bring myself to try the newer tablets by Samsung because I like this one so much. I will definitely be heartbroken when this one decides to break down on me!",
"I love my new tablet.  It's light weight, easy to use in bed for reading or watching Netflix.  This was a replacement for an old, dying Nook Color.  I knew I did not want to go with another Nook,but besides the Samsung Tab S,  I had also  considered the  newest Kindle Fire HDX 8.9.  What sold me on this Samsung tablet, was the fact that I could add a micro SD card  for additional storage, and that I could use apps from Google Play store.  Because I have a Galaxy4 phone, I was familiar with the operating system.  I had it up and running in no time.  I got a great deal on the Dazzling White one, $50 less than the Titanium colored one. The only big disappointment for me is the fact that I cannot view Amazon Prime Instant videos on this tablet.  It's not Samsung's fault, but Amazon's.  Funny because I can watch them on my Samsung phone... but apparently they are incompatible with this tablet.  Makes no sense to me.  All I can think is that Amazon is purposely doing it so that you have to buy a Fire Kindle.  :(",
"This is my 3rd Galaxy tab. My first was the original 7 in. Tab that I used with Verizon cellular service. My second was the 7 in. Tab 2. When my contract with Verizon expired I used the tab with WiFi only. I saw this Tab S in a store and was really impressed so I bought one on  Amazon.  It's pretty fast and responsive. Movies play very well on it. I like being able to  add an SD card  which  really  expands the storage. No need to keep pictures and music in the cloud. I have small hands so it's  a little awkward to hold but I knew that going in. I bought a matte screen protector which takes away from the clarity of the screen  but it's  resistant to fingerprints  and smudges which  drive me crazy. :)

The battery life is pretty good ..maybe 4-5 hours which  is ok. A larger battery would've been nice but would make the Tab too bulky. As it stands, this tab is very thin, all things considered. Very happy over all.

"This is better than the newer models. I've had the newer models and they just didn't match up.
First of all, this tablet has haptic feedback, meaning that when you type on it the keyboard vibrates which is a must when you are typing a lot. I do not understand why Samsung pulled that from the newer tablets.
Secondly, the speaker placement is near perfect. There is a speaker on each side of the tablet when viewing it in landscape mode. The audio quality isn't the greatest but it is on par with the newer Samsung tablets where the placement of the speakers is at the bottom.
Viewing the display outdoors is a delight and gets nice and bright.
The tablet feels thinner and much lighter than even the 7"" newer models from Samsung.
Coupled with the official Samsung cover-view case, this is a great device.
It does lag at times but so do the newer models and my biggest complaint is that the battery life isn't the greatest; however, I can get 1 1/2 days of heavy use out of it.",
"Nice display, very bright, very high resolution, nice Octo CPU, snappy tablet!  However my application would not run on it adequately.  I'm not sure if it was the fault of the application itself or not.  However it wouldn't run the app smoothly so I sent it back.  It ran all the other apps on the system just fine.  Downloaded the latest Lollipop OS, but didn't work well with my Phantom3 drone app, Pilot.  I also wanted a Verizon cellular version, but it wasn't available because the tablet was too new, I think.  All of the Verizon stores didn't know anything about it, nor when a cellular version of the Tab S 8.4""would be released.  So I sent it back because of these two reasons.  I bought an Ipad Mini which runs the app fine.  That's another story, as the Ipad isn't very intuitive, and that's what it's suppose to be from all the hype you hear. I've been in computer technology for 35yrs, owned one of the first Macs sold in Calif (1984), but these iPads take some training and getting use to.  I hate the IOS keyboard versus Android, and I miss my Swype Android keyboard utility.  Swype for IOS stinks to high heaven.",
"This tablet is a solid computing unit, but it requires a case like an Otter Box or something to provide it with protection beyond the clip-on screen shield provided.

The response time is excellent, and the camera and microphone work well for Skype and other applications. Once you install an app for email, etc., it performs very well, and rarely has period of network drop or undue interference that impedes the overall function of network communications.

Of course, more memory, higher link speeds, and higher resolution are always better, but this tablet is a great buy for someone at a lower price point. The imagery displays great on a display that is better than one would think. The increased resolution of the tablet goes beyond some desktop video cards on a typical LCD screen and will not disappoint.

Throwing a fat microSD card inside will alleviate most storage bottlenecks when considering multimedia, but bloated size apps and unspecified storage locations may cause some headaches for non-power or not-tech savvy users.

This would also be a decent unit for a tween or high school student for school tasks and research. More intensive users may want a slightly more powerful tablet, but this computer will work well for a wide variety of users.",
"I've had a variety of tablets, running different operating systems, including the Nexus 7 and iPad. I've carried an Android phone for years and have always hated going back and forth to my iPad, so I purchased this to replace it. mainly to consume media on, as I love Spotify and PLEX.

Tablet Construction I Like

- Very slim design
- Feels well made
- Very little bezzle around the edge of the screen

Features I Like

- Screen looks amazing
- Micro SD card up to 128 GB. I've added a 64 GB one into mine that holds PLEX movies and all my downloaded Spotify music
- Finger print reader is also nice, however most company Exchange servers probably won't support it
- Ultra fast processor makes using the tablet very fast

Software Thing I Don't Like

- I'm not a fan of Samsung's Touch Wiz interface, so I replaced it with Nova Launcher which has a better Google feel to it
- After replacing the launcher, I discovered the Samsung no longer support lock screen widgets, this includes if you are listening to music, you have to unlock the tablet to change the song, no controls on the lock screen

Conclusion

This is a great tablet if you like to take media on the go with you, as you won't find many others with these kind of specs with a micro SD slot. My only complaint is Samsung's interface, which you can replace with a different launcher, but it still limits things like what you can do with the lock screen. Great tablet though!",
"It has been just under a year now that I've owned this product, and it has been crashing increasingly since I purchased it to the point that it hard crashes about every 5 minutes of use...most often while playing games. I am currently looking for warranty information because this device has become unusable which is appalling considering I spend $350 less than a year ago. I've tried everything I can think of to fix it, or at least make it usable, but nothing has worked. I have never been more frustrated with a piece of technology. There are a lot of positive reviews for this product, I was very confident that I would have the same experience...maybe I got a lemon, I don't know. Any time the battery dips below 60% (which is after about 10-30 minutes of use on a full battery depending how you use it) the screen starts to flash, and within 30 seconds the device crashes and restarts - losing any information you had up prior to the crash. This is sometimes delayed while using it when it is actively charging, but even then it crashes relatively often...not to mention sitting on the floor next to a wall outlet is not the ideal way to use the device. If I use this for a 30 minute session, I get about 15 minutes of actual use. The other 15 minutes is waiting for a crash to resolve and the device to restart, which occurs 10 or more times at minimum in a 30 minute period. I am extremely dissatisfied, and hope to get this issue resolved with either Amazon the manufacturer.  I will update with my progress so that others in my situation can get this resolved as well.

Update:
Since my device was under warranty (the original year long manufacturer warranty that came with the purchase), Samsung was able to repair my device free of charge and it seems to be working just fine now. They did not tell me what was wrong, or what they did to fix it so I cannot update you on that end. The only thing they told me was to make sure I was using a Samsung approved charging cable - which I have always only used the cable that came with the device. Unsure what was wrong, but appears to be fixed. If you're having some of the above issues, either do some symptom research online or hopefully you're still under warranty and don't have to pay for a fix. My experience with the online form found on Samsung's website was okay, it took a little while for them to return my inquiry initially but after that the service was adequate. I'll update this to a 3 star review now that I'm not having any issues with it.",
"ITERATION#2:
In my first review (ITERATION#1), I gave this tab a 1 star rating because it came with a cracked screen. Amazon received my complaints & instantly sent a replacement. Than you Amazon.

I'm so glad that I didn't change my mind about this tab because of the broken screen. I've used it for several days now and I will say I am highly impressed. I highly recommend it and I'm looking forward to a Note version of this tab.

The screen is very bright. The resolution is ""razor"" sharp and the colors are truly gorgeous. People complain about Samsung TouchWiz overlay, but I think this unit UI is highly function. On my unit, I removed some of the so called bloat software and left some on it. The MS Office program is the best I've seen on any tablet so far.

Perfect for reading ebooks.

The camera lags by several seconds before taking a shot. This is a minus, but I don't rely on my cameraphone for serious shots.

The high resolution at times makes characters appear in very tiny less than optimal viewing sizes for apps not designed to take advantage of the high resolution.

ITERATION#1:
I will update this review again, but for now this is my take on this tab.

The unit I ordered was received with a cracked glass. It will not power up to the home screen.
The low voice over instruction hums when you glide your finger over the home and back keys. The screen stays black.
However the screen never comes up. I don't know if this is because of the cracked screen or a manufacturer defect.
It will not power up with the power up button.

This tab is so slim and portable, it's just the right size for me. In fact as soon as I saw the picture on Amazon, I said this is the tab for me. I would have even buy the LTE/GSM version but it was not yet on sale here on Amazon. SO I had to settle for the WiFi version first. Unfortunately, the packaging material is very thin and in my opinion very flimsy. As a result of this any little bump and bending from handling and shipping can get the screen to get cracked easily. I am not saying this is the reason why my own unit got cracked. But with the type of packaging used, I was not surprised to see the crack.

The packaging is sub-standard and it lends one to ask the question, ""Why should Samsung make an apparently excellent product like this and then package it in a sub standard packaging? These people really need to do something about this quality issue.""

I have used several Galaxy phones and 2 galaxy tabs without any issues, but the type of packaging I saw with this tab is in my not so humble opinion completely unbecoming. If they continue like this, then I will have to start considering and recommending other androids.",
"I have grown to like this tablet even more after I have had it for a couple of weeks now. At first I wasn't too sure as I bought a tab 4 - 8 for my GF at the same time and it seems almost as good for a much cheaper price. But this one does have a nicer screen when it comes to pictures and movies which is a primary use for me. But because the tab 4 doesn't have as much resolution as the S it is actually easier to read text in such apps like gmail. But I still have good eyesight so again I could deal with this as pretty much a non issue for me. So I was happy until I saw the 10.5 version while shopping last weekend and really liked the larger screen even more. I thought about it and because my primary use is around the house and not traveling, I decided to exchange this model for the 10.5. I think this version will do better as a pc with a keyboard as well.So for me the larger unit is a better fit for my needs. But if I was traveling a lot I would stay with this version as it is much easier to carry around and is a good size if you want it all (traveling and home use).

Pros:  Great screen for movies and pictures. The colors are very rich and the included sample movie looks great- almost 3d at times. If this is what you want to use the tablet for you have picked the best screen you can get right now for the job. Samsung got this right and even Apple falls short in this area. It took me a bit to get used to the colorful screen but now that I have, it is hard to look a laptop screen and not think it has a problem with flat colors.

Lots of features for geeks- file sharing with your samsung tv and also your pc. Screen mirroring with the tv as well. This was important to me but it should be noted the tab 8 can do this as well, all except a physical hdmi connection. This unit has great connectivity, just take your time to figure it out as some of it takes time to get it setup correctly

Con: Only con is the price and I have mixed feelings about this. On one hand , Samsung does make a superior product,so they deserved to be paid for giving us what we want. But then they turn around and make the tab 4 series which are really good tablets at a much cheaper price (at least on Amazon). So if you want the best, the S is what you want. But if really good but not the best is good enough, look at those tablets. This is the first tablet I have owned and the pricy screen is worth it to me because it will be used as a multimedia machine.

Best advice: Don't make the same mistake I did. Decide if you want a tablet primarily for home or traveling so you can get the size right the first time. If you can, find these units in your local stores so can judge for yourself before you buy",
"First, about the tablet itself. I would give it 4-1/2 stars. This tablet replaced an Asus Infinity T700. This tablet was everything the Asus wasn't. There was no lag time, the screen was magnificent  and I wasn't constantly getting my internet interrupted. I have a Galaxy S5 Smart phone and the learning curve was nonexistent since it felt and behaved much like my phone. My biggest complaint was that the battery length seemed to be lacking but it was a small issue compared to how much I liked this tablet overall. But.......

0 stars for Samsung.
I purchased my Galaxy Tab from Amazon on June 21 and it arrived June 24. On July 20 I used it off and on all day with no problems. I set it down on the table, came back in 15 minutes, woke it up and the screen was completely wonky. Lines and squiggles and half black. The touch had also quit working. I called Samsung and told them the problem, they had me try a hard reset...so I humored them (I'd already done that) nothing doing. They said it was still under warranty and I should send it to them. They gave me a RFR and so I did. Two days after it arrived at the repair center I got a call from Samsung. ""Unfortunately your tablet isn't covered for the damage it received. There is an internal LCD crack and we will not repair it under warranty."" Me: ""Why?"" Them: ""Because it was not defective, the tablet was damaged. But for $159.00 we can repair it for you"". Me: Well I won't repeat what I said to them, but suffice it to say that their implication that I broke the tablet is BS. I did NOT break this tablet. From the moment I had it I had a screen protector and a case. I'm careful with my electronics. After a few more choice words I told her to send it back to me.

5 stars for Amazon
My only other recourse  was to return it to Amazon for refund or replacement. I've never returned anything substantial to Amazon so I wasn't sure how it would go. I chose a refund. In the meantime I'm waiting for Samsung to return my tablet. Looking at replacing the defective tablet I realized that I really liked this tablet but now the exact same tablet is $100.00 more on Amazon now than it was when I bought it at $297.00. So I cancelled my return thinking I could re-return it and select replacement instead of return. WRONG. Since I cancelled on 7/28/15 it is past the 30 day return period which was 7/24 and it wouldn't let me change it. So my return was cancelled and I had no other recourse. CRAP! Now what will I do, I'm not about to just give up on $300.00 worth of tablet. So I asked Google, found a phone number for Amazon customer support and called them up. I explained the situation, after some back and forth he said that they would normally tell me to return it to the manufacture but ""this time only"" not only would they accept my return but would send me a new tablet free of charge. All I had to do was return the old one. YIPPEE!!!!!

While I am very disenchanted with Samsung's customer service...I mean how do you break a perfectly working tablet by setting it on the table and walking away?  It seemed like all they wanted me to do was either get me to spend $159.00 to fix it or go away. I was very disappointed.

Amazon on the other hand went way beyond my expectations and I am very happy with their flexible return policy and their customer service. I've spent quite a bit of money with Amazon through the years and I'm happy to see that my faith in them has been justified. Thanks Amazon.

PS.  I received my replacement tablet shipped 2 day FedEx. It was ordered while I was still on the phone with customer service. Thanks again, Amazon. You are the best!",
"Overall, I like this tablet, but I have a few concerns. I have both android and apple products, and I'm not loyal to either.  I have an ipad 2, and I've been heavily researching tablets for the last month or two because I would like something smaller with a better quality screen. This tab s has a beautiful screen, expandable memory, split screen capabilities to run two apps at once, perfect screen size (portable but not too small like the 7"" tablets I looked at), and nice options to customize (something I miss on my ipad).  The fingerprint scanner works great. The gold bezel on the white model is really tacky. I was planning on getting the simple case from samsung, but now that I see how bad the gold looks in person, I'll be looking for a case that completely covers it. I've also had problems with lag and reloading in the email app. When I click on some emails, it will flash the picture twice, pause to reload, and pop me back to the top of the email when I've already scrolled down. It's extremely irritating and something I don't experience on my ipad or kindle hdx. I called samsung support to see if something might be wrong. The tech support person remotely accessed my tablet, had me remove my email accounts and re-add them, and also checked a few other things. Nothing helped. After doing all of this trouble shooting, she then told me it was my network. It's not. My other tablets are fine. Then she told me it was normal. Which is it-a problem or normal? And how should that happen on such a top of the line tablet? Then she later told me google is working on an update to android that should fix the problem. Story #3 as to what's wrong. I don't have the greatest faith in samsung tech support now. At any rate, I'm hoping it's just something defective with my unit, and I'm getting a replacement. I'll update my review if the replacement is better.

UPDATE 7/14/14
The replacement tablet is also having issues with the email app.  On top of the issues described above, it is also adding white lines through some of the e-mails (they don't appear on the ipad). So, I decided to have a Samsung rep from best buy look at it (they do free troubleshooting of minor problems there no matter where you bought your Samsung tablet). Shrinking the font size to the second smallest setting got rid of the white lines. They think the blinking/reloading/scrolling issues are with the email app and certain senders. They added the yahoo email app, and it doesn't have the issues when I view the messages there (the yahoo app is very, very fast-faster than the native email app). Long story short, I either have to deal with the issues to have a combined inbox in the email app or use two separate email apps (and the gmail app is very, very slow for me). I've downloaded a couple different email apps from the playstore to try to get a faster and smoother combined email inbox, but so far I haven't found one I love (if you have a suggestion, please tell me!). Personally, I didn't like the over saturated look of the adaptive display (makes skin tones, among other things, look very unnatural). So, I changed the display setting to basic, and I prefer that. I purchased an ipad mini with retina 32 gb for a bit cheaper than this tablet, but comparing them side by side, I think I'd rather deal with the issues of the Samsung tablet for the sake of the screen. The ipad looks really washed out next to the s tab. I also prefer the customization options with android. As a final note, in case it helps any of you who also have carpal tunnel, the email apps I've used on the s tab are easier on my arm (my carpal tunnel radiates to my elbow) because you can scroll from the bottom of the screen rather than having to lift your arm every time to touch the buttons at the top of the screen on the ipad. In the end, I'm keeping the s tab and returning the ipad mini.",
"It had to be a good tablet as someone stole the first one that was in route to me.

Had a Nexus 7 tablet but it was beginning to freeze regularly, making me have to turn it off/on. But no problems so far with the Samsung one.

Good screen size too.  I love being able to use a SD card to store things if wanted. I'm using a 64 gb one.

Update: Dec. 16, 2015....Everything is great about the tablet except the battery life.  I like to play games like Candy Crush and Words with Friends, and they just drag the battery life down quickly.  I have to charge the tablet twice a day if I play my games more than a 1/2 hour or so.

Also in November I discovered that the tablet wasn't charging correctly and the battery was losing it's charge faster and faster.  Samsung paid for me to return the tablet/charging cord and they were both replaced.  Fast turnaround time.  But I'm just not happy with how long the battery lasts.  I think that if you don't play games much it's fine, but otherwise beware.",
"I spent weeks researching to find the best tablet, and this was the unit I selected. I ended up reselling it a few weeks later. Here's why.

I bought this tablet for its display. It has the among the highest pixel densities of any tablet and possesses the AMOLED display technology, which should deliver the highest contrast of any display on the market. The display certainly does have stunning blacks. However, there's something strange about the display. It may be great for videos and gaming, but that is where the pleasure ends. The colors are a little *too* vibrant, and when you turn off the enhanced color feature, the display still appears somewhat glaring and the colors seem too blue or green or something.

The display has a reading mode, but it didn't make the display more pleasant to read. I primarily wanted this unit as an e-reader. If you are looking for an e-reader, stay far, far away from this device. While the stated viewing angle for the Galaxy Tab S is supposed to be amazing, it's not. Even the slightest tilt of the display will turn it slightly blue or slightly green. It's so sensitive to this that as you look directly at the display, the far top will be slightly hued one way, and the far bottom will be hued the other way. This is part of the reason reading this tablet is highly uncomfortable, as the colors shift as your eyes move to the bottom of a page. Further, the text area seems to have a strange haze around it that makes it difficult to concentrate on the text. Even the general text area appears to have some bizarre hazy beige box surrounding it. There is simply something harsh and offputting about this display that makes reading it an absolute displeasure.

Further, the touch-buttons at the bottom of the frame make the device nearly impossible to hold without accidentally bumping them with a finger or even with the palm of your hand as your skin folds over the edge. To use the device, you have to hold it very gingerly as if it were incredibly delicate. The slightest slip and you've exited your app or brought up the multitasking window or gone ""back"" in your app. Long-term holding of the device is tiresome.

You may think I'm overly sensitive, which I probably am, but I handed an iPad Mini (1st gen) and the Galaxy Tab S 8.4 to several friends and family members with the same pages of text. Everyone agreed that the iPad was a world better to read than the Galaxy Tab, even with its far inferior 1024x768 resolution and LCD panel.

Lastly, this thing has terrible battery management. I had the iPad Mini and this Galaxy Tab sitting on my nightstand. I used the iPad for reading and the Galaxy Tab sat unused. I had to recharge the Galaxy Tab twice in the span of time it took the iPad to reach 50%. Even with basic web activities, the battery drops at an alarming rate.

Also, watch out for plastic case cracks. Mine was developing cracks near the headphone jack. The frame also creaks subtly while you hold it and adjust your grip.

If you buy one, please keep the following things in mind:
* You cannot resell it on Amazon without a verified account, authorized by Samsung themselves to sell it.
* Demand for these devices is low on Craigslist. After a month of posting below market average, I had only one reply.
* Returning to the seller involves restocking fees and return shipment fees.
* You're probably going to lose 20-25% of your purchase price if you don't like the device, as I did when I finally sold it.

On the positive side, the device is LIGHTNING fast. I've never used a tablet this fast. It has reasonably good sound with stereo speakers, and is capable of running Android 6. Video is very vivid and crisp. It is VERY lightweight and I like the aspect ratio of the screen.",
"This device was a mistake on my part because I never would buy anything second hand or refurbished . Amazon said it was too late for me to cancel the order. It was not but, they said it was.  There was no crack in the back of it and I thought great after taking off the cover . As I was bracing for how big that crack would be given that there was a case that went with it . Anyway resolution horrible too bright and  even at a different mode it was to bright. also very slow charging it took forever to charge this thing. My old tablet does a faster job and it is three years old. Also the sound is terrible and it lags like crazy.  Freezing is also a problem with this model. Everything is wrong with it. And the white color is more  of a cream color. I wish amazon would stop selling and reselling junk like this. It is going back ASAP.",
"I was extremely skeptical regarding purchasing this tablet, but I did want a new one as my ASUS Transformer Prime met a bitter end when the charging port had broke.  I just did not have faith in many Android tablets and was going to spring for the cheaper Galaxy Tab 4 as I really wanted something to work as an e-reader (books and comics), and movies on the go. However, I had experience with Samsung Galaxy phones (S1 and S3) and was familiar with their eventual lag and generally slow response. I also really never enjoyed the TouchWiz interface.

I’m glad I was able to play with one and hear a review from someone I knew, because this tablet was a fantastic purchase. Bravo ,Samsung. I left your phones, but your tabs are king of the hill right now. The screen on this thing is beautiful, it feels deliberately luxurious and pleasant to hold, and TouchWiz? Revamped, improved and downright delightful. It has some bloatware that I could do without and their welcome console that you can find when you swipe left on the home screen but nothing that really takes you out of it. For my comics, this screen is absolutely outstanding. I was going to go for the 10 inch but this is honestly more than enough; holding it, whether I’m on the train or at home is comfortable, and with the right case you can prop it up and load up Netflix or any other streaming / video app in your house. Saved us a purchase for a TV in the kitchen/dining area!

Highly recommend it.",
"Deciding which tablet is right for you can be really tough!I searched but Samsung offered a much full tablet experience than any other tablet out there in the market.I chose this tablet mainly because of its functions and features.The tablet includes:a good quality camera with flash,IR blaster(which I use alot),a gorgeous Super AMOLED display,fingerprint scanner,sd card compatibility,and a nice looking overall build.I enjoy watching movies and videos on this tablet,it just makes you love watching it more and more.Its very snappy/fast and gets every single task done with zero lag,this tablet is great for productivity!The battery life is just phenomenal,I get almost a full day with having to charge from morning when I wake up until I go to sleep at night.Additionally,one more thing concerning the battery is the Ultra Power Saving Mode which saves you battery up to 2-3 extra days without charging!One amazing extra feature is the fingerprint scanner which adds extra security to your tablet and even bank accounts.The tablet is crazily thin and slim,and the dazzling white version of this tablet with the gold rim just makes this tablet look luxurious.One discomfort would be the placement of the soft touch buttons which I press almost everyday by accident.Samsung really does create the best tablet experience and I wished they could of made the Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 with the same useful features as its predecessor offered.I highly recommend it.
Pros:*Fast processor
*Fingerprint scanner
*Super AMOLED display
*sd card compatible
*Long-lasting battery
*IR blaster
*Nice camera
Cons:*touch button placements",
"The Galaxy Tab S is the best 8"" Android tablet on the market, bar none! 8 inches is the sweet spot for portability and usability when it comes to Android. I'm typically a root and ROM kind of guy when it comes to Samsung devices because I'm not a fan of software bloat nor TouchWiz. Android really doesn't need any ""fixing"" by Samsung nor anyone else, so a vanilla Android experience direct from Google as it was intended is much preferred. Not having a wireless carrier tied to this device really minimizes the software bloat to an acceptable level. Replacing the stock Samsung launcher with Nova really helped to improve the home screen and app drawer.

There are some Samsung apps that you can't uninstall but you can disable most of them. A free year of premium Evernote and a 2 year 50GB bump to my dropbox account are nice touches. I'm not a huge fan of Samsung's TouchWiz theme largely due to the color scheme and layout but overall the experience is fantastic. At the end of the day it's about the apps, right? Some of the included features are very compelling as well. The multi-window function is my favorite feature allowing 2 apps to run side by side. Smart Detect looks for your eyes and prevents the screen from dimming if you're actively reading. Samsung's S Finder is annoying and useless, Google Now/ Search is a much better option. The finger print reader is an interesting feature but is flawed in my experience. It does work intermittently but sometimes takes numerous swipes to unlock, too many unsuccessful and you have a timeout. Hopefully they'll keep working on this.

The hardware is best in class, with a quad core CPU and 3GB RAM, more than any other tab in this space. The display is vibrant and visually stunning, really incredible. Opening and switching between apps is effortless with a large battery providing hours of screen on time. I read reviews of some pretty outrageous battery life claims which I have yet to experience. I can, however, use the tablet fairly regularly throughout a given day on a single charge with no issue. SD card expansion further separates this tablet from the Nexus line.

I also highly recommend getting a Samsung Book Cover for this tablet to provide protection, a 3-position stand and added beauty. Not cheap but very much worth the investment. These products are well crafted and feel premium despite repeated rebukes of using too much plastic. It really doesn't feel cheap at all.  Samsung's continued use of a physical home button as well as reversed capacitive ""back"" and ""open apps"" buttons is disappointing and goes against the core Android design aesthetic. All other Android devices have abandoned physical buttons in favor of Google's 3 on screen buttons which is simple and works well. I bet Samsung changes this in future products unless the purpose is really only a desperate cling to maintain parity to the Apple model.

Pros:
-Best in class hardware, screen, battery
-Android!!!
-Premium construction and materials
-Free extras like Evernote premium and 50GB dropbox
-Light, thin, portable...8"" is perfect

Cons:
-Samsung TouchWiz
-Some software bloat
-Some features need to be made better like finger print reader
-Will be slower to adopt newer Android versions such as Lollipop/ 5.0",
"I have used a whole PILE of tablets. Huawei, Apple, Amazon, others by Samsung (including later models like the S2).

This is still the single best tablet yet made. It is ultra-thin, ultra-light, reasonably fast, eminently hand-holdable, perfect for reading e-books, with a bright, saturated screen, the right aspect ratio to show movies large (almost as large as on a full-size iPad) but without wasting space with horizontal or vertical letterboxing.

I prefer it to my 2018 iPad and my iPad Mini 3 by a large margin.

It's a crime that nobody else makes an 8.4"" tablet with this screen ratio, and a crime that Samsung left this format with the S2 and later models and went with the strange 4:3 aspect ratio that iPads use (and that doesn't match any modern media format, meaning tons of wasted space).

That said, there are drawbacks:

- Battery life is abysmal for a modern tablet
- It's a bit more flexible than a person might like—thin can equal creaky at times
- It's getting older and a bit slower

But... For the price—there's still not a tablet I'd rather have. And I'll be sad when these are all just plain too old to be useful any longer, as nobody else to my knowledge is making an 8.4"" tablet, nor a tablet this thin and light, nor a tablet with a screen this awesome.",
"I have been looking forward to this Tab S 8.4 since it was first announced that it was coming out and now that I've been using it for the last few days it is fantastic!  I am a huge fan of Samsung tablets.  I have the Galaxy 2, 3, tab pro and 4.  I must preface this review by saying that I'm an older, retired women.  I am not very tech savvy, but I have learned to use tablets by trial and error.  The Samsung tablets just keep getting better and better in my opinion.  The AMOLED screen is amazing!!  It is so clear and bright, the colors are very bright and vivid.  Reading text is wonderful.  The tablet itself is as light as a feather, I can hold it for long periods of time without any fatigue or cramping of my hand or arm.  It is very fast and smooth.  Set up took less than five minutes.  WiFi connected immediately and all my info synced in a matter of seconds.  I use it for email, Web surfing, games and watching movies and TV shows and it is fantastic.  The keyboard is very nice, very responsive and easy to use.  I can't say enough good things about it.  The battery is also very good.  I went through the apps and either Uninstalled or turned off the ones that I won't use and I turned on the battery saver.  There is also a battery super saver, but it turns the screen to black and white and I wasn't crazy about it so I'm using the regular saver.  I have been using the tablet for 2 days of heavy use and the battery is at 38%!  This is my new best friend....it is perfect!  With Prime it arrived in 2 days.  I would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for either a new tablet or a replacement!!",
Liked everything about it particularly the solid state hard drive.,
"This computer is not worth the money. It has constant audio issues it is defective .

Look at another computer this one is not worth the money!

This company does not stand by its product!

I have to constantly restart this very expensive piece of trash because the audio completely stops working!

DO NOT BUY

PCOnline will do absolutely nothing in regards to the faulty products they sell on line!

They will leave you hanging high and dry!",
There isn't anything that I don't like about it. It was very easy to set up too. So far we haven't had any problems.,
"This HP Envy is fantastic.  Fast, (which I wasn’t used to).  Love it!",
I use this for my home computer… plenty of memory and great processor,
works great!,
Its an off brand but its serving its purpose. Im only using it to run a cmos telescope camera.,
I am extremely pleased with my Windows 10 laptop. I have always liked the Windows brand the best and I look forward to enjoying my laptop for a long time.,
La computadora se calienta mucho y no tiene el teclado retro iluminado como dice la descripción pero todo lo demás es excelente,
"Cheap build quality, installing Windows was a slog, and couldn't even keep 3 tabs running without slowing down. Id say you get what you pay for, but Ive bought laptops faster than this for 1/3rd of the price.",
"Buenas calidad y terminado, muy resistente y útil",
I really like this computer. I had a lenovo years ago and this one is so much lighter.,
I cannot comment on battery life at this moment. Just got the laptop. It’s great!,
"I can't say enough good things about this laptop. Well made, fast and top notch in every way.",
"Love my new laptop. It's fast and super light. I've recently added a second monitor, which was something new for me and I had no idea how to , I did have to by an adaptor but I think that was because of my inexperience. All in all I'm very happy with what I've found so far.",
"This is a great computer for the price.  The larger screen is nice to be able to have a couple programs open at once and see both when I am unable to hook up to an exterior monitor.  The speed is nice and has good storage, although I haven't tried any video editing on it yet, though I have run a few programs at once without any noticeable speed difference.  The battery life is not as long as I would like, however I knew from other reviews that it would be a smaller battery life, and so it was not a surprise to me.",
"The laptop has great battery life. However, I have been meaning to contact the seller regarding the lack of brightness. I have the brightness all the way up and it is way dark. I have been using a second monitor.",
"Lenovo Warranty

  I purchased a Legion 5i (17”) with GTX 1660 Ti 81Y80005 US for $1,209.46, so it wasn’t a cheap laptop by any means. Within 6 months the blue screen of death occurred the laptop would not start up. When I bought the laptop Lenovo’s PREMIER service support came with the machine. I contacted Lenovo’s PREMIER service support.
  The PREMIER service support agent told me I needed to pack up the laptop and send it to them for repairs. I asked for my money back since this happened so early in the life span of the laptop, I was denied. I asked for a new laptop, again I was denied. I was told there was nothing their PREMIER service could do and to send the laptop back to Lenovo. Anything but PREMIER service.
  I am a disabled Vet on a fixed income with my spouse who is also disabled. We use the laptop daily for medical appointments, ordering medicine, bills, ect. We lost all that information.
  I contacted Lenovo PREMIER service once again. This time I got someone on the phone who decided to help me make a restore usb image. I did this on a dell backup laptop that is 10 years old and still works, that laptop replaced a dell laptop that was out of warranty but dell replaced it. It took two days to get this laptop running. But a least I got someone who was willing to help. I guess willing is PREMIER service.
  I spent over 1,200 on a machine that crashed within 6mo. I again requested my money back or a new machine, both denied. I was denied help, until I persisted. I then asked PREMIER service for a warranty extension since I have lost confidence this laptop will last. I was sent an email asking why I needed an extension on my warranty, I explained basically what I have explained here. I was offered a 30-day Warranty extension. 30 days is a slap in the face Lenovo PRIEMIER service.
  I have bought office chairs, hue lights, tablet all from Lenovo. This is the first time I have has to use Lenovo’s warranty service. I will not purchase anything else from Lenovo because all is fine until you need support. Or in my case lack of it. Do not buy products from Lenovo. There isn’t any support if it goes bad. PREMIER service or lack of any service. Thank you Lenovo PREMIER service for the 30 day warranty extension After all my purchase’s and my $1,200 purchase that crashed within 6mo. STAY AWAY, STAY CLEAR of purchasing anything from LENOVO.",
Good,
Love this computer.. so fast and perfect size.,
"Will not connect to my hot spot on my phone, very disappointed!",
"I am working from home.  This computer arrived on a Monday, and it died on a Saturday.  The customer service from Lenovo is non-existent.  They will tell you they are sending you a box to ship it back in for repairs, and when you contact them to find out why it never arrived you'll hear that it's ""on the way.""  Shoddy workmanship.  It was a magnificent computer for the week it worked, so, if that's as long as you want it, you'll be fine.",
Exactly as described. Extremely happy with this laptop,
Very fast processing. Light weight and a large screen.,
"I made this purchase less than a month ago, when I got the laptop, I used it for a week without problems, then it didn't turn on anymore, I had to send it to check since I don't live in the US, the problem is the M2 solid disk that brings the laptop, now I will have to buy an extra solid disk and pay the windows again, I do not recommend the product or the seller, do not waste your time or money.",
Liked the ram and how it ran games disliked the stuck pixels,
"why am I getting docked 10% restocking fee?  It was definitely not a functioning laptop.  if it worked, I  would not have had  to return it  it just keeping me on a ridiculous loop that i could not get of  demanding i enter my password for email  everytime i entered my password, the screen would go black  this cannot be right

I am not happy  you need to refund me the last 10 percent",
This is the first laptop I've had so I don't really have anything to compare it to but I think it suits my needs.,
Great value and laptop but battery life could be better.,
So far ok will update review when i use it more.,
"The computer itself is great.  Exactly what I wanted for the price - RAM/HD/Touchscreen.  However, the wi-fi keeps dropping.  None of my other devices in the house are having this issue, including the laptop that this one is replacing.  I'll be browsing the web, and then randomly loose connection to my wi-fi.  Have to click on the indicator and tell it to re-connect.  Afraid to download anything that would require more than a couple of minutes let alone doing any zooming.  I have a Lenovo laptop for work that I use to work from home - no issues.",
Excelente combinación de calidad y precio,
My keyboard on the screen does not let me type a “B” or “Y”.. but over all it’s a cool tablet,
So much faster than my Dell. Happy with it so far. Seems like the battery life is good but haven't really used enough to tell for sure.,
Love it!  Retired so just the basics. I thought that the page down button was at the upper right corner as most laptops are. Was calling tech support when I noticed it was on the down arrow. It's fast enough for me. Setup was nothing. Almost no input from me.,
"It got frozen after a few day use.
First of all, the advert says it has HDMI, but this computer was delivered to me without a HDMI. So It's got me thinking what happened to it? ??
Enough said already.
Return.",
"Everything is great about this product the only thing is the battery life. Doesn’t last as long as I think it should. Would have given it 5 Stars across the board if battery life was better.
Otherwise I’m very happy with my purchase.",
"We would prefer a laptop that worked and a company that stands behind their products and will help their customers when they have a problem with a $700 laptop instead of trying to sale them more Warranty! How stupid do they think people are? Throw more money into a piece of junk? I don't think so! The screen began to freeze and from there we started getting bars across the screen and then eventually cutting off.
We tried calling Lenovo Tech Support but they said Warranty had just ran out, after 1 year and we would need to spend $230 before they will do anything.
Also, have tried to contact PC online who sold this piece of junk through Amazon and of course, no reply! Amazon has also reached out to PC online. No reply! Stuck with a broken computer and no support from Lenovo, or PC online! DO NOT PURCHASE FROM LENOVO OR PC ONLINE! You will be sorry!",
"It is early, but so far so good.  My only regret is not reading the small print on ""no backlit keyboard"".  I often use at night to stream entertainment and have to turn the lights on to change websites or change content.  I could use the touch screen instead, but I am not a big touchscreen users.  Time to learn.",
"Lenovo is top of the line....would highly recommend....I bought one for myself and my two sons....we all love them so much....keep your charger close by as the battery runs down fast but everything in this laptop is worth it.....Well made .....
I am working from home now because of Covid19 measures and need the best ever Lenovo is it.... I also have a Lenovo Desk Top at work lol........My company knows great value for money and I do too....",
"I love this laptop, I am doing classes online and needed something fast,had allot of storage, and a lasting battery life. This laptop has all of that and when I do charge it the charging is quick.",
"I purchased this for my photography, it doesn't hold much at all.  Ended up having to pay a monthly fee to Microsoft to store docs and pictures.",
I am thrilled so far with this laptop.  I got the 20gb RAM and 1TB storage option and it has not frozen up at all yet.  I use it mainly for Adobe Creative Suite and remote work as well and it is really fantastic.  Highly recommend for anyone looking to update their hardware from something older.,
"This is my 4th or 5th Lenovo computer, including a couple notebooks, and this is my favorite one by far. I have wrist, arm, and neck issues but the keyboard is large enough that I don't have to ""squish"" or hold my arms in tight in order to use the keyboard without pain. It's lightweight and the touch pad and touch screen are very responsive. When I have to use video conferencing for work, it understandably strains the battery, but it hold out just fine on days I don't have online meetings. The monitor is sharp, and with the adjustable blue light filter, it's easy on the eyes. It's just about perfect.",
You can't beat the quality of Lenovo. My last laptop before this one was also a Lenovo.  Had it for 14 years and had absolutely no issues with it.,
great pc,
"The graphics card is great, no lag, such a great machine for a beginner gamer",
"Great PC. Fast, reliable, and looks good 5/5 would buy again!",
awsome,
"My computer came with a defective video card and defective Wi-Fi capabilities.  I spent about an hour and a half on the phone with IBUYPOWER's IT group trying to fix the issues, and eventually they concluded that I needed to get the tower exchanged.

Furthermore, they were disappointed that I didn't buy it from an approved vendor and told me that I shouldn't buy from Bright Spot again.  Be careful out there people.",
so upset and confused it didn't last long and now i have to go out my way to ship it and wont receive it back for 4-5 weeks...so much money lost in the process !,
"Item was unstable out of the box. Blue screen issues from day one. It seemed to ease slightly but progressively got worse till it corrupted the os. The RMA process was very painful and frustrating with misinformation posted in the updates on-line. All the while, customer service would provide different excuses for the lengthy repairs while not really knowing. Received the computer back today ""WITHOUT"" windows installed. iBUYPOWER takes no responsibility and says that's not possible, must be a glitch. Upon further investigation, they returned it without the primary drive.",
"This was my first PC, and it is everything I ever needed as a starting PC. I love it!",
I am running any game I want and its handling it perfect. I'm really enjoying this whole set up.,
I love how precise and caring they are with the packaging. The cpu cooler seems a little on the cheap side but other than that i am loving my purchase. These are the best gaming pc ive ever owned,
Son loves it everything he needed and wanted for him with going to school for gaming/it,
"This is my second ibuypower pc. The first one's motherboard was put in bent against the case and had to be readjusted but has been running games like Civ, GTA, Apex, etc decently for about 3 years now. After buying this one it ran for about 2 months until the motherboard decided to quit on me and I had to get that component completely replaced. Good graphics and nice overall performance until then, but incredibly disappointed in my experience with both machines' motherboards. Noise is ok, but the 5 fans create a constant white noise and I'm struggling to understand the decision to put 3 fans in a position where they are basically pulling from an obstructed area (front glass cover). Likely won't be buying an ibuypower machine again, but it was a good starting experience and lesson as to why everyone was screaming at me to build my own.",
"So, after less than one year of use working fine until now, hard drive goes bad took a part to see what was wrong found out there was no SSD installed only at HHD",
I loved this for how affordable and easy to use it is. Has fulfilled all of my needs and I would recommend it highly to anyone looking for a good PC in the future.,
System runs great and very quiet.  Wish there were some better instructions included but if your buying a system like this you know how to find it.,
"I myself already had an Ibuypower computer which I got years ago and it still works great. Well, my daughter's computer was slowly dying so I decided for Christmas to get her a new computer which I went with the Ibuypower brand since it always worked for me. She loved it and so far it is working smoothly. It's a product I will probably continue to buy from them.",
"I've never bought from ibuyppwer before and was skeptical.  I have had to eat my words. The speed is fantastic.  Most games are great. COD is odd, as it doesn't like the graphics card, but all in all great.",
"I got this computer as my old one had been dying and slowing down along with other issues, and I have to say I think it is great. I got it while it was on sale, so I think it was worth the price. It has lasted almost a year with the same performance; it runs demanding games very well and smoothly. There is 16GB of RAM which seems to be the standard nowadays, at least for casual gaming, and it has been enough for me so far. I have run many games on this and performance-wise, it is definitely worth the money. As I've seen with other reviews, it can get a bit noisy but, in my opinion, it's not that big of a deal. My only beef with this machine (which is just an annoyance for me) is the designed hole on the front. What happens is the suction of the graphics card pulls in lint and dust through the big hole and the lint gets stuck on the film type thing on the card. It doesn't affect anything, however because there isn't an easy way to access the front of the GPU without removing a few components inside, it provides a visual annoyance. [Image attached] Again, it's just a slight thing that isn't too bad, just for people like me who find it a little annoying. Solution: don't live in an old house with dust and lint. Haven't had a problem with either keyboard nor mouse, both work as expected.

Overall:
Performance for price - 5 stars, runs smoothly and lasts.
Keyboard/Mouse/RGB - 5 stars, haven't had a problem with either one. Keyboard and PC have customizable light modes. Haven't had a problem with either.
Noise - Decent, 4 stars, depends on what you're doing with it and how much noise affects you.
Tower Design - 4 stars, looks nice and clean, holds components tight, though inconvenient in regards to potential buildup of lint or dust on GPU film/sheet/cover thing.

Great PC, I recommend it if you are a casual or somewhat intense gamer. Probably not best for running mostly AAA games where hardware specs are required to be high, though it still runs most well. Would recommend adding extra RAM at some point, although I haven't yet. Enjoy it if you decide to get it!",
"Uhm, where's the sd card supposed to go? Purchased combo with laptop and sd card but there's literally no slot on any side or the screen or anywhere. Picture attached shows the loation where the slot should based on Amazon's product pics yet...
So I'm knocking off three stars for that.
Will update if I hear from Acer or seller regarding missing SD card slot",
Screen was broken upon arrival. Can’t set up computer.,
This thing has crashed every time I’ve tried to use it. It will not update windows.  It will not open settings.  Edge crashes when I try to download a different browser.  NONE of the fixes works.  Reminds me of why I ditched PC’s 15 years ago.  Wish I’d never retried them.,
"This computer is not touch screen but i like it. It's light weight & cool to touch

 Update:  I am having problems with this computer now.  It does not always turn on & often it is not connecting to my internet service.  If I pick it up on the right side with the laptop opened up, it moves from the current screen to a completely different document or screen.  It's bazaar.  I'm wondering if this was truly an unused laptop.  Will be checking out the warranty....",
Perfect for students and workers.,
Todo perfecto en general para el uso que le voy a dar,
Pantalla 20/20 lo máximo en resolución y realismo de colores,
"The M2 hard drive is fast and adding a second SSD after ordering the ""NIMITZ 2.5inch HDD/SSD Hard Drive Cable"" was a breeze, it would be nice if the cable came with the laptop. My only complaint is the number pad is laid out deferent and I have to watch so I don't hit the wrong numbers. Other than that I would still buy again.",
"I'm a simple human, I just needed a laptop to be able to write again that didn't glitch after a week nor died after 6mons this laptop IS THE BEST THING I'VE INVESTED ON! So worth it! I can't say much on specs and such, I had a friend explain things to me and told me that for what I was going to use it for it would be just fine, and it's more than fine, I love this!",
"I requested it from BC, Canada. I’m very happy with this purchase. I bought it for 3d modeling design. It does the job. Great performance. Nice display. 10/10. I love it.

The specifications the laptop I got
Screen 15.6’
Core i7 11
16gb RAM
512gb SSD
NVIDIA MX350

Cons: I didn’t like the color of the ENTER key. It has green borders. I’d prefer the key to be just solid dark color. This is just an aesthetic point, though. I think I can live with that, since ASUS is always being a great brand an the great performance this laptop has overrides everything.",
"I bought this as an all in one machine. I am a computer science student, I play video games, and I do basic web browsing and streaming. I bought the laptop with 16gb of ram and an I7 processor. The laptop doesn't seem to be that fast or efficient at performing multiple tasks which surprised me. My Macbook air is significantly quicker and is the same price point. The biggest downfall to the laptop is the battery life. I think I may get an hour and a half tops before I am at roughly 5%. My laptop is only 6 months old at this point and I am getting rid of it because of how poor it performs. I know the laptop is the cheapest price point for the power however I wouldn't recommend it at all.",
". La mejor opción para estudiantes que requieran instalar programas pesados y con muchos recursos. Con sus 16 gb de Ram van a notar que vuela.
. La pantalla OLED es increíble. La definición y dimensión que tiene es excelente.
. Con los procesadores gráficos que trae es capaz de cargar videos de hasta 8K en segundos.
. Es actualizable a Windows 11.
. La batería completa dura aproximadamente unas 4 horas de uso normal, pero puede variar. Llega a cargarse al 100% en 1 hora y media como mucho.
. El teclado retroiluminado y la huella dactilar funcionan de manera perfecta.
. La recomiendo totalmente, su versión i7 de 11º generación es inigualable y tiene un encendido que no supera los 30 segundos.",
Great computer for a fair price,
Still learning about this computer and Windows 10. Without help from a book I'm finding my computer very easy to operate and it's quite intuitive which makes me stay working on it for long periods. Very enjoyable indeed. Wish it had more storage but I purchased an 8T external storage device for the many years of photos which I will soon proceed to transfer. Price was right and overall expectations for what I can accomplish using this light weight laptop will soon take up a lot of my time...for the time being I'm still in awe at having made my decision to single this unit out and make the purchase. I did make a correct decision.,
Great laptop..,
"The laptop works great for the basic stuff I use it for, and I appreciate the convertibility. It's fast, lightweight, and easy to use.",
"Arrived in fine shape. Looks good and works well.

Too bad it was loaded with crudware: MS, Acer, McAfee, etc.

The touch screen is a real plus. Adequately speedy.",
Thanks.,
"Slowest laptop I have ever used in my life. I cant even load google chrome without my whole computer crashing. Waste of money, oversized paperweight.",
"It's just a cheap, slow, junk cheap laptop. The screen has a terrible view angle. Wouldn't buy or recommend anyone to buy.",
Nice Asus product for 400 bucks. The only,
Good everyday workhorse of a laptop. Handles moderate daily workload well. No issues with setup. Screen clear and bright. Good quality construction.,

"Whether you're barely using it to idle, system temps always 60C or higher with terrible performance.  My Raspberry Pi4 4GB performs better...  Thought maybe it was because of Windows 10 so I shrunk the Windows partition and  created a Linux partition running PoP_OS KDE, same heat issue.  It has a blower fan, it looks to be a design flaw or maybe a weak fan, when they refurb they should replace the fans.  Ended up returning.",
"The product had obviously not been tested prior to shipping. It regularly shuts down due to over heating. It also has a constant message about a power surge on usb port,  even with nothing plugged in the ports.  These hp elitedesk are worth buying but not from this vendor.",
Worked for 3 months before it went blue screen and stopped working,
It’s pretty good for what it’s used for but a little older model. It didn’t have an HDMI port.,
"I deployed six of these in a small office for very light use--web browsing and one lightweight application that does most of the processing on the server side. The employees all complained that they were slower than the third generation Core i5 machines these replaced; I had to pull them back out and upgrade to Ryzen 3400G machines instead.

I cannot recommend these.",
"The model I received had Display Port and VGA, but no HDMI port. I contacted Sunset micro and they offered to send a Display Port to HDMI adapter. However, i never received the adapter. Thus the 4 stars. Otherwise, I like this device a lot. It replaced an 11 year old laptop and provides enough processing power for zoom meetings, PowerPoint editing, etc.",
"Price is good. internal SSD failed after just 2 hrs. But, I had a spare SSD. After changing out the SSD, the computer has been trouble-free for two weeks as 24/7 security camera server. Overall a good deal in my opinion.",
"Looks brand new, not a spec of dust inside. Configured as advertised.",
"Every other time I turn it on, there's artifact all over the screen. Also, one of the RAM slots don't work. What can you do for me? Amazon tech support isn't working because form will not let me type in my phone number for a call back.",
I really like the size and speed of this HP Mini Desktop. I would recommend this to everyone. A+,
"I like the computer and form factor.  I was able to upgrade with M2 ssd and added RAM.  Worked fine for about 9 months, then refused to power up.  I purchased a new power supply but that did not solve the problem.  Died after 9 months of usage.",
Great little box to run for a small office computer. Performs suprisingly well after upgradong the RAM.,
I paid about $150 for this small unit that was refurbished and has windows 10 operating system. I'm satisfied and I believe it is going to last longer than a laptop.,
This Unit has ran solid for over a year running 24 x7 as a SBC on a VoIP PBX.  No issues.  Happy with it.,
"My computer has been shutting down during online work, causing data loss, rebooting and asking me to reinstall items as well as trying to get me to initialize the original setup like you get when you buy a new computer with preloaded software.  Today it finally alerted me to a cooling fan failure, which explains why it keeps shutting off randomly and without notice.
Do NOT buy refurbished! It does NOT work!!!!",
"Did not receive pc as advertised in description......does not have backlit keyboard....returned, waiting on refund.",
"The unit shipped did not match the amazon description (see below). While the unit is brand new it did not include the backlight keyboard, sd card reader, rj45 port, or third usb port. otherwise the hardware description is correct as far as chipset, ssd drive, and ram.

"Try calling, never can get pass the computter helper. LOL",
"I took a chance on this exact laptop,,,  refurbished and its just like brand new.. So i saved about 100 .
Had it about 2 weeks and all is great with it, and no issues at all... Mine has a back lit keyboard by pressing F5 .. Im sure this will not last as long as my old reliable HP Envy i got from amazon refurbished 7-8 years ago, but time will tell.",
Product was missing multiple features. Keyboard wasnt backlit. Was missing usb slots and rj45 slot. Also missing cf card reader. Dissapointing to say the least.,
"I bought a refurbished computer that was approximately $100 less expensive than brand new. It was brand new - no imperfections at all. This is an excellent computer, and after contacting the seller about a software glitch, it loaded Windows 11 quickly. I love this computer, and the seller is excellent and reputable. Highly recommended model.",
"Tough Books are great, albeit expensive, tools for IT staff.  This refurb is in fantastic condition and at a Chrome Book price.  Sadly, today is the best day of the rest of this laptop's life because it's going to work right now.  They are heavy and bulky, but have all the connectors we need and are built to take a beating.  It shows very light evidence of prior use and is functionally perfect.",
"This laptop stated it had a backlit keyboard. It does not, therefore I am returning it.
This is the second Asus laptop I have had to return for falsley advertising of having a  backlit keyboard. Come on Asus.",
I purchased this computer to replace a damaged laptop.  I needed a lot of storage due to large music and photo library.  I was looking forward to having 1Tb of hard disc space.  Once I received the laptop and attempted to transfer the data from my external hard drive I discovered this computer only had 256Gb of storage.  Advertising 1Tb and getting 256Gb is pretty infuriating.,
"Si viven fuera de los Estados Unidos no compren este ni ningún otro producto en Amazon. Luego de dos meses de haberlo comprado la batería falló y el sistema operativo también. Nadie se hizo cargo de la garantía. Entonces hice un gasto de $1,000 y prácticamente tengo que tirar la laptop a la basura. En las políticas dice que tenemos 30 días solamente para que aplique la garantía, lo cual es ridículo! Repito, no compren nunca en Amazon y menos esta marca Asus, como es posible que falle a los dos meses!!! Un robo.",

"I got mine at a super-low price. I wanted a 17"" for better screen visibility.  It's not an inconvenience to travel with a 17"" and much more comfortable than a 13 or 15"".  This model has a back-lit keyboard (that doesn't really light the keys) and mousepad user-friendly.  It is not exactly the model shown on Amazon; have to use Asus website app to identify drivers, BIOS, and specs.  *Major complaint is Qualcomm wireless adapter, the wi-fi reception distance is truly poor compared to Intel models.  Windows 10 is not that bad and starts up in 4 seconds.  Hardware is not compatible to downgrade to Win7, even swapping-out hard drives.  Laptop is about 5 pounds and metallic.  The AMD processor is strong, the video quality, and memory expandable to 2x8 GB, which I upgraded to.  I did also remove the 1TB hard drive and installed SSD 2.5""",
"Right out of the box, turn on the brand new laptop and it has one burn-in spot on the screen.  Because it was more than 30 days from my purchase when I first started the computer, it was past the sellers timeframe to allow me to return it for an exchange. Dealing with Asus customer service is terrible. I had to pay out of my own pocket to mail it back for service to fix the burn-in spot on the screen. When it arrived back to me- it still has the original burn-in spot and now a second one that is new. Customer service tells me I have to send it back again. Never will buy another Asus anything again !
UPDATE:
After the second time the factory attempted to fixed the burn-in spots on the screen, there is some improvement but they are still visible.
We were assured before we sent it for repairs, that the hard-drive would not be wiped.
It was returned to us with all of our loaded programs (Office, Photoshop, etc) completely wiped. Talk about a pain to reinstall everything. I am so frustrated! I hope that all of you reading this will move along to a competitor, find another seller and manufacturer. Stay away from this product!",
Screen quality is beautiful and set up was effortless.  The performance is great.,
"I've had this ASUS for almost two years now; I went back to school during the pandemic and needed a computer, and it has gotten me through countless hours of reading, writing, and video lectures without a hitch. I am the kind of person that often has multiple programs open at the same time, and I started getting some glitching with the cursor, lagging while I typed, and some crashing programs.
I checked the system processes, and the RAM runs no lower than 55%, which is WAY too overworked, so I have a memory upgrade coming in two days and will be ditching this weak 8gb for 32gb and it should be all smooth sailing from there on out! Great computer!",
"Do not waste your money and buy a Lenovo laptop.  Google “Lenovo black screen”, and read if this is something you want to deal with.",
"When everything works, this laptop is great.  HOWEVER, The touch screen stopped working correctly in less than nine months.  The company refused to replace it as it had been past the 30 day return window.  Do not waste your money on this laptop!",
Great product but shipping time was way to long for a PC,
"With under 4 months of use, the screen started to glitch, it got worse over the past few weeks. Como here for the return policy and it broke down a week after the return window was open. A $900 laptop that didnt last 4 months. Because there's no warranty nor return from the seller, the cost to replace the screen will cost me $350. Absurd...",
A great laptop for my daughter.  I'll definitely purchase another one when my laptop needs replacing.,
"My husband works in computers and we picked this out together since it’s a good brand that businesses often buy for their employees.
It works great and I love the touch screen.",
"I liked everything except that it doesn’t have a Ethernet cable port, I guess that’s my fault for not reading everything, but luckily I had an adapter, still a VERY GOOD COMPUTER!",
"If you were not told this was used,  other then the fact it came in a very good NON oem box....  you would never know.  It works so well and is so nice I just ordered a 2nd one for my mom.  Also for Ubuntu Linux users,  the most resent v22 LTS loaded perfect.  HDMI works perfect for audio and video with no effort on my part. the wifi nic is only getting 2.4 not 5, but I have not looked into that yet.  YES its an older I7 but it performs very well, and as I said it looks and feels like its brand new.  My battery has a strange issue where it goes from 100% to 50% in 90 minutes then 50% to 0% in maybe a minute.  The seller offered and is sending me another battery, ""THANK YOU"" however I see you can buy a brand new battery for a very reasonable cost here on amazon.  If I can add pictures after I hit submit.....  I will",
Fast,
So my girlfriend got me this laptop for Christmas and it looks nice and it’s beautiful it’s just the one thing that I can’t handle or deal with anymore on how so SLOW it is it literally takes forever for anything to start up or work,
Slow,
This is really pretty but slow,
Product works less effectively then my 2012. You get what you pay for.,
Super slow doesn't even begin to describe it! Don't waste your money!!,
This arrived with a broken screen and had to be returned. The return was accepted with no issue,
I dislike the whole product and would like my refund back please and thank you,
"No funciona bien,es muy lenta para todo para encender ,para ver videos no la recomiendo",
No me llego el cable de alimentación de corriente para cargar la laptop,
DO NOT BUY it is trash and very very slow.  It freezes when I try to ANYTHING!!,
Absolute trash. Slow to do anything it’s asked to do. All I’ll be doing is running a single spreadsheet so I’ll make this last for the cost. Pain in the behind otherwise.,
"Las condiciones materiales del producto está en perfecto estado ....pero el funcionamiento como tal es lo peor ... Es excesivamente lenta para todo, está maquina no funciona para hacer nada ..??",
"Bought the laptop on a whim because I was in a bind, for it to have 4GB of RAM it runs shower than my Sony VAIO. This is ridiculous, I should've read the reviews before making an impulse buy.",
"This laptop is a peice of junk.
I've had to do 3 factory resets since I bought it.
I've talked to the tech support people.
They taught me how to rest it.
It's slow doesn't work very well at all.",
I can't operate because of no instructions,
"The description indicates that this laptop has a 2.65GHz processor. That is incorrect. The one I received has a processor with 1.10GHz. This laptop is also very, very slow. This description is extremely misleading, false advertising and a lie.",
It took 7 minutes to get there,
Works great and looks brand new.,
I have had this laptop for school and nothing else. I don’t use it for personal use at all. It’s slow. It doesn’t work well at all. I have great internet. It’s not that for an issues. It’s a terrible machine. Do not purchase.,
Terrible. I believe you guys should have techs that actually look at product and have knowledge. This product came Oct 24 2022 and here it is oct 27 2022 and I can’t use it. It freezes up and shutdown. I got it for work and can’t even use it. Never again,
The body of the computer is beautiful but over all it’s so slow. I bought it thinking it was brand new only to see it was refurbished and I thought “it’s 245 so it’ll work as good as a new one” well I was completely wrong but at least they gave me my refund,
I bought for my granddaughter on her 17th birthday she loves it,
"Compré este producto para hacer un regalo deseando que fuera una buena compra, a pesar que leí algunos malos comentarios quise guiarme por los buenos, sin embargo gran decepción ya que la laptop estaba demasiado lenta, quise cambiar el idioma y estuvo por horas y nunca se hizo el cambio, acceder a internet era imposible y al final decidí devolverla.",
I surprised my wife with this new laptop which inspired a new lap dance from her as a sign of gratitude...,
THIS IS ENTIRELY TOO SLOW IT LAGGED WHEN I PRESSED THE SHUT OFF BUTTON. I SPENT HOURS SETTING IT UP DOWNLOADING UPDATES FOR IT TO DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO IMPROVE THE LAPTOP. THEN I FACTORY RESET THE COMPUTER AND PUT IT AS A NEW AND STILL IT WAS JUST AS SLOW IF NOT SLOWER THEN BEFORE WHEN I TRANSFERRED ALL MY DATA DO NOT BUY NOT WORTH IT AT ALL,
It works but the mouse pad button isn’t reliable.,
"Very slow, kept freezing up, had to reboot several times. Returned for refund.",
"Hasn't been a month since I purchased, I'm already re- installing Windows.",
"Nice condition, but very slow to boot up and takes forever to type, very slow.  I understand that it's refurbished, but for the money, I would have expected better.",
"Set up was fine but the computer was slow on nearly every function. I did everything, from using HP diagnosis, uploaded to current drivers, etc to no avail. I guess you get what you pay for.",
Beautiful laptop was in mint condition. The problem was it was terribly slow. In 21st century that’s a bit unheard of unless there’s a issue with laptop,
"The feature sound okay, but in practice, the processor is not powerful enough to handle win 11. Probably works fine with 10, but it's very slow on 11. Takes 5-10 minutes just to boot. I ended up returning it.",
Everything on this laptop lags. I cannot even type on the keyboard because with takes over a minute for the letters to show up. It is super slow and frustrating. I did not read the reviews and made an impulse buy. This was the worse laptop experience I have ever had. I will be returning. Not worth the hassle.,
"The laptop looked like new, but it was slow. Pulling up the settings took almost 5 minutes. Since it's a refurbished laptop I thought it might just be the one I got. Returned it for a replacement. The second one I got was even slower. It took over 10 minutes to change one small setting. I never even got on the internet because starting the browser took too long.",
"I bought this as an Amazon refurbished product.  It seems like it is no wonder why this product was returned or otherwise unwanted by someone else ... it runs SOOOO slow (out of the box, as provided, without any modification) ... VERY frustrating and really NOT worth the reduced cost at all.  For instance, I also have a four year old Dell Laptop (that I'm actually using now because the HP suuuuucks) and it runs about 100 times as fast (that is not an exaggeration).  I have uninstalled pre-installed applications and done other basic attempts to speed up the processing ... but, still, it runs S .... L ... O ... W ... DO NOT BUY!",
"This is a replacement for one that was defective. Out of the box it’s slower than molasses in January outside in Canada. I can’t recommend it to anyone other than it does have windows 11 installed. It does need 72 hours of updates. Yes, 72! And then it still won’t operate as well as my Asus mini. I’m extremely disappointed in my purchase and thought since I’m just writing on it, it won’t matter but it takes nearly an hour to reboot after a shut down and nearly 45 minutes if it’s just asleep. Buy a more expensive product with better chipsets and not refurbished. You’ll be happier.",
So I love the computer it's nice and all but my grandma ordered it and sat it up it was so slow so the next morning she said she wanna gonna return it but I told her to let me have it so yea it's slow and needs work,
After several years of not eating a laptop for anything I started a new business venture that requires me to have a laptop. I was looking for something affordable and not too big that would have enough storage. This product checked all those boxes however it is very slow going and it updates constantly. I've gotten to a point that when I want to use it I turn it on a 1/2 hour before so that by the time I'm ready it has done everything that it needs to do and it can function the way I need it too.,
Bought it for my wife. The price was right for me. She is using it already.,
"Love the color, screen size overall look is sweet but with a SATA drive and only 4GB RAM it's slower than a sloth.  Good friend of mine is an IT guy and got me a stick of 8GB RAM and had me pick up up a 500GB Samsung SSD. He cloned my drive, installed office and Adobe. Now I boot up from off to Windows in 20 seconds, power of to all lights off in 11 seconds. The $80 hardware upgrades took this computer over the top. Getting to the RAM and harddrive is pretty easy, so if your confident in your skills it's a good price and with the upgrades you'll have a pretty good computer.",
"It takes almost 5 minutes to boot up the laptop.  I would like to note that we have high speed internet in our home.  Once I am able to get logged in, the screen sometimes freezes, or changes altogether.  I would take this back if I could.  It is not worth the money spent on it.",
"When i turned it on. I got a quick winsys error message. Booted after that.
A few days later the system completely crashed
Had to reset. Since then it is running very slow with intermittent crashes.
All I have done on the system is a couple of word docs. Not happy.",
"Computer was slow with 4gb RAM, after upgrading to 8gb RAM, machine ran much better. Worth the listed price.",
Me encanto buena compra para lo que ocupo hacer,
Soooooo slow...closing tabs because eventually says not responding. Other devices work great. Freezes or don't open. So frustrating! I need for my Masters and not going to cut it!,
I seen someone write how slow this laptop is and they couldn't be more wrong.  It runs just and worth every penny.,
"It is exact as the description says, I love it.",
Video Player is loading.,
"The laptop does not have a keyboard backlight, they are laying!!!",
El peso no es tan ligero como creí pero por lo demás todo bien,
Wipe and reinstall fresh windows.,
"System arrived on time and very well packaged. Everything you need except for display was included, even a wifi antenna ! All pieces were super clean, almost seems like new. Overall very impressed. Would definitely buy again.",
The power button on the front doesn't work. It does start if I unplug/plug in the power cord in the back. I wish I had known before spending an hour setting it up and I would have returned it.,
"Much more capable than a raspberry pi which are now far to expensive. Buy these used units with 2x the storage, and 10x the processor. Runs Debian, Ubuntu, mint, elementary, and a host of other Linux flavors with zero issues.
Excellent space saving design for east of deployment behind a monitor, or in a rack on a shelf. Run 2 and have redundant non-windows ldap/print server for a small to Med office using just Linux.

Excellent units!",
"thanks. I had a problem with the disc, but they solved it quickly, and they were very friendly",
"So the computer is not wireless ready and had to buy an adaptor.
I also received the item and same day saw the price dropped so i reached out to ask if they would match this or if i needed to return item and for 3 days now no reply from seller.
Very disappointed, do not order from Tek-Go Corp - RFRB",
I suggest to buy Panasonic though book instead of that.,
I have never used this laptop due to the fact every time I do they tell me my login was incorrect so they're signing me in as guest. I cant down load ANY apps or get in the internet. Whenever I get to do so it kicks me out completely.,
Ordered it through my brother’s account and it’s a trash do not waste your money I ll be returning it tomorrow.,
No se conectaba a internet,
"Within two months, I had to start using tape to hold the laptop together. Within three months, after closing the laptop, almost the entire screen came loose from the keyboard. I do not take this device anywhere, nor do I use it in an aggressive manor. This damage is all from casual use. I expected the laptop to be lower quality due to the price , but I was expecting it to last longer than it did. Like the title says, thank goodness I bought a warranty otherwise this would have been a waste of hundreds of dollars :(",
"Like everything, but not a touch srceen.",
"I purchased this lenovo IdeaPad 1 15.6"" Laptop to use with my RevoPoint scanner, and it works well.  It interfaces with my WiFi 6e office network very well, the (not touch) screen is clear with good color quality, and it is fast enough for my use.  It does have limited USB ports so if you have a number of accessories to attach, you will need a USB hub.  For me, the one USB port on the right is used for my mouse (I do not use the included trackpad on the Lenovo) and the USB Type C port on the left is used for the RevoPoint scanner.  There is an additional USB Type 2 connector on the left, as well as HDMI and headphone jack, and a MicroSD card slot on the right side.  There is no built-in CD/DVD drive so will need to add that if you use CD/DVD discs.",
"I got this for my girlfriend as  her computer had aged and she didnt like the chrome books i had. Iwanted to make sure she had something that wasnt going to lag, she doesnt use computers much but i didnt want her to be frustrated by a sub par celeron and low ram machine. the 16g of ram and the processor are great. lots of speed and the discounted price made this a steel.",
Love it...no problem so far!,
This refurbished tablet is great - just like new!,
"Great product, wife loves it. Absolutely no problems.",
"like new , woul buy again",
Perfect condition and works great!,
Good,
Very happy with this tablet and the service was great. Thank you.,
"Great Product!  Fast Shipping, Great Condition.  Fast and Excellent Quality",
"Great what an excellent job! keep up the good works guys, thanks!.",
I gifted this item and the recipient could not be any happier.,
Love my Galaxy Tab 3! It does everything I need/wasn't it too!,
So far so good bought 2 months ago and.no problems with refurbished tab,
"Hey, I'm using it to write this.  It was quite the deal",
Great tablet love it easy to use and great price for the product,
Was like new. Automatically updated to Kit Kat. I truly love my Tab 3,
"Perfect tablet, It doesn't look like refubrished, everything good. The only thing different is the box.",
DO NOT PURCHASE,
"Bought the Tab pro 8.4 also & so far they're both comparable in functionality, screen clarity",
"Small scratch on the frame, hardly noticeable.  Works great, like having an oversized Galaxy s3.",
pictures are crystal clear and sound on my tablet perfect. very pleased with my new tablet.,
These are great tablets.  Mine had absolutely no blemishes and works perfectly.  I love it.,
Am really happy its my first tablet and works perfectly. It was as new in a box.,
Way nicer than I though... I thought a refurbished would have marks or something but no it's perfect!,
"I bough  this item it everything worked good, only I don't like it don't have language Vietnames",
"I have had my tab for 3 yrs now, still works great.",
One of the best Christmas gifts i ever gave to my mother......and she loves it.... always  using it.,
I buy this produit in jully and today is not working,
"After 3 bad tablet purchases, this has worked great for me!  Good quality good price.  Completely happy.",
The tablet is doing fantastic my daughter is hell on stuff this is her 3rd but its great so far.,
Very happy with this one .I had to send the first one back but this one is good . Thanks,
Nice and beautiful,
I love it even though I bought it for my mom's birthday.  I think I'll get one for myself.  Haven't had any problems yet.,
"AFTER TWO MONTHS OF USING IT, IT QUIT WORKING. THANKS TO AMAZON THEY GAVE ME A PARTIAL REFUNDS. SO I CAN TAKE THIS TO LOCAL TECHNICIAN ,LIKE BEST BUY.",
This is a refurbished product but there is no difference between the condition of this one and a new one. I am very satisfied with it.,
really good purchase. i use it almost 3 mounth and works perfectly.camera is not as good as i expected but for this price...anyway i love it .,
Mmmm,
"So far it's been really great, for some reason it doesn't like to hold charge very well, I'm thinking it could be the way I have my settings",
"This is, by far, the easies tablet I have ever used. Long battery life, everything I need when I travel. Absolutely no problems with the reconditioned Samsung, Highly recommended!!!",
I have this tablet already and this was purchased as a gift. Beautiful condition. Am testing it out now and seems to be flawless. Received promptly with no issues.,
Bought this as a gift. Already owned a similar samsung device and loved it. The person who recieved this as a gift loves it and is still using it daily.,
Good,
"Great product for my daughters.  They love them.  Easy and convenient.  Finding a case to fit them was a little harder than I expected but
Otherwise they are perfect.",
nice table!,
"I just received this product. I am very disappointed with its look. There are some patches on the corners of the screen which are very evident either the tab is turned ON or OFF.
I am returning the product.",
Superb Tablet - the 8 inch screen is bright and sharp.  The processor is fast and the Samsung features are great.  Even though it's refurbished it looked brand new out of the box.,
Enjoying the product so far!!,
Working well!,
Great product,
Sorry I bought it...I had it shipped outside of the US and now this won't charge. Guess I am stuck with it since it will be more costly to send back and not even sure if it will be accepted knowing it has left the US.,
It was nice...not to big,
That's good still working cool,
So far so good.,
Refurbished but looks brand new. Can't complain.,
It was ok,
"False advertising.  Tablet is only 7 inches, not 8.",
I loved this product. It was so easy to use. Very compatible especially for a student. This tablet is worth the money. You can take totes  with it in class and it is very easy to use.,
Thrilled with this refurbished tablet. It arrived like new and so far hat proved to be sleet fast and really a great find for the price. I have already told friends about the great deal i got and where.,
My wife likes this tablet and almost stopped using laptop.,
We received this Samsung on good delivery time. It is Refurbished and working well so far. I got this one to replace my kids one. My friend got hers as a gift and it was ordered on Amazon. So far so good.,
"This as cash,
I'm very happy with my tablet",
"Great value, great purchase!! Was at my house before the date given at checkout & it works like a dream!!! As an apple user it has been an adjustment getting used to it but once I got the hang of it has been great!",
The battery not charger. The product is very well. Four stars,
Bought as a gift and had to returned it was in terrible USED conditions I later did purchased a brand new for $208.00.,
"LOVE the Samsung tablet.  The 8 inch is just right for what I use it for.  Refurbished is great because it saves me money and the tablet is still in great condition.  Have had no issues with it.  Arrived on time, everything works great.  Thanks!",
Was ok until it stop working ( not charging) it's seem to be a problem with Samsung as the same thing happened with my wife's table which was bought new.,
"so far so good, the only thing that i not cjeck is that the tablet dont have led or flash",
"Great product for the price, works great, would not have thought it is a refurbished item.  Very satisfied!!! Would definitely repurchase!!!",
"So far, so good.  I have not had it long but it appears to be fast and the screen quality is better than expected.  I only  use it for emailing, ebook reading and some games.  I do not have a need for the camera.  Wifi seems to be fast",
"A solid Samsung, performance :) and price :(",
"I was unsure about purchasing a refurbished tablet, but it was worth it.  Short of the lack of retail packaging, the tablet appeared brand new with no scratches or blemishes.  I have had the tablet for sometime now and everything works as it should.  Saving a few bucks on a refurbished unit was well worth it.",
"Had a busted micro SD port, guess that's why it was cheaper.",
"As expected.  Loved my galaxy s3, this works great.  Decent form factor, hard to type on.  Fast, occasionally freezes momentarily.  Good wifi.",
its ok. but cant figure out the front view camera its like a weird.,
"Ordered this for a child that loves playing games. Giving it ""5 stars"" because this product exceeded our expectations! Look new, not refurbished. Not a scratch or blemish to be found. It did not come with instructions so we watched a video on youtube. This is one of the best products I have ever purchased!  Very easy-to-use. Good value for your money.",
filled in for the broken screenon the previous Tab 3 I had owned.  New screen replacement would have cost $200+.  This is much better.  Thanks,
Works like new. No problems with this unit so far. A bit heavier than I expected for a mid-size tablet. Ability to add 64 GB SD card is nice.,
"Waited a month or so to use this before writing this. I was leery  of buying refurbished after several bad experiences, but this was one of the best purchases I've made. Arrived quickly and was perfect right out of the box. Easy set up, no connection issues, downloading issues etc. It has functioned perfectly in every respect. Wanted a good quality tablet to do basic things on without breaking the bank. This was a great find.",
"A little hard to hold but a great substitute for a larger laptop , particularly when traveling. Also great for book reading. Battery life a little shorter than I had hoped, but adequate. All in all a good tablet.",
This works really well. It can be used on a tv with the right connecting cord. I originally  got a 7 inch tab 3 but that can not be connect to the tv in any way. So I ended up purchasing this after. Some times the buttons don't work that great now that it has been over a year and the bf messed up the sd card slot. But over all i do recommend if you wanting a tablet you can use on the tv.,
I like samsung products a lot..  But I would not buy the refurbished item again..  I have never been lucky enough to have good one..  I had a battery charging issue this time..  But generally this tablet is one of the best.,
"We have 4 different Tablets before this one..
2 ASUS memo which fell once and screen died... broke again after factory repair with 1 foot fall to the floor
Panasonic... Nice but way to much bloatware
Dell TAB 8 inch which the wife loves.. But would like the Samsung... She might get that for Valentines
and a few others...
The Samsung has been through allot with me including me tossin it a few times(with rubber case)
We even take it into the cold and heat on a boat... Tethers great to our phones",
"If I didn't know that I had bought a refurbished model, I would swear it was brand new. Works great, long battery life (I'm talking 6-10 hours of CONSTANT usage playing games and doing a lot of downloading of apps/videos and screen brightness at ~20-30%), clear vibrant screen that can get very bright, the camera is lackluster but if you are buying a tablet for the camera you're doing it wrong. Overall very pleased with the device. I bought it in March of '15 and it's still going strong. Running just like it was right out of the box.",
"I'm new to the Samsung Galaxy but not completely new to an Android tablet. The first thing I noticed is the Samsung has FAR better battery life than my existing tablet. The next thing is the operating system is upgradeable, I've already upgraded to version 4.4.2 and it was a snap. Some apps and the way you deal with these apps is a little bit different. Product support is great and when needed they will walk me through a procedure. When I really need help I ask my 7 year old  granddaughter and she gets me going again. I would recommend this refurbished tablet to others.",
"These came really fast. My husband put one on for me. Application went good,a couple tiny air bubbles, no big deal. What i didn't like is the scratches left from my stylus. That really suprised me. They do have a life time warranty if i remember  right. So if you dont use a stylus they are perfect.",
"I looked high and low for tablets. For a good price and have bought crappy ""dragon"" brand both my daughters and nieces broke. & none just seemed worth the price, I decided I'd try this refurbished,  (although I've always been against  refurbished)

Bought 2 because  loved the first one so much.  Definitely  look brand new. And i thought they were just because  they are so perfecr,  After further inspection I did notice on both of them the little button in the middle does took a tiny, tint, tad bit used. So that's how I figured it wasn't brand new. But my kids love them and DEFINITELY WORTH IT!!!!",
"The tablet is what a tablet should be, although it seems to take quite a while to charge.

The seller's level of customer service is exemplary. Somehow, I ended up getting not one, but two defective units. I've never had anything like that happen with a refurbished item before, but the seller was so accommodating. They made sure to communicate with me every step of the way, which is incredibly important, particularly when is comes to such a frustrating situation.",
"I`ve been having problems with it every since I got it. The WiFi connections have been especially problematic...scanning and connecting sporadically and that has been a source of real frustration. The camera has yet to work...with each attempt to use I get a prompt saying the camera has failed.
Having bought this item that was ""refurbished"" it lacked an owners manual and clearly defined instructions on what to do...or where to go for help. It been really frustration.",
"When I received the tablet, it was packaged adequately. After unpacking, I inspected it and it looked brand new. I plugged it in with the (included) power adapter and charging cable to charge the unit to 100%.  After charging, I powered it up. Everything worked as it was supposed to. It's a bit different than the Apple products that I'm used to since it's an Android but I really like the Tablet a lot. I've had no problems with it so far, unless you call the battery depleting fairly quickly a problem. But that seems to be a ""problem"" with just about ANY electronic device. It could be that I'm just not managing the battery correctly. All in all, I'm quite satisfied with my purchase especially since I paid about HALF of what the Tablet cost brand new.",
"A useable tablet but found the speed to be slightly slow and resolution not quite high enough.  Would process video like Netflix somewhat sluggishly.  Ended up selling it and went with an ASUS 572c that has been awesome in both the resolution and speed areas for the $150 range I wanted to stay in.  Still like the iPad better as the apps are more refined and security better but like the $150 Android tablet for dragging around at work, in the garage, or pretty much any place else outside of the house.",
"I brought this tablet for my 70 year old aunt to use FB. However when it arrived it was a little smaller then I imaged for her seasoned eyes. I gave her my 10 inch and I kept this one. That was a great decision there is a lot of functionality that the 8 inch that's not available on the 10 inch. I would have given it 5 stars but, there are still some functions I would like to see Samsung develop. Such as redline for spelling and record memory after its shutoff (unlike the iPad once you turn it off it begins from scratch when you restart).",
"The Tab 3 was delivered in a plastic wrap sealed box but the tablet itself did not have any of the usual plastic film of a new unit.  The accessory box was ajar and there was no documentation.  I guess when they said ""includes all original accessories"" it excludes any user manual or quick start instructions.  You can easily download the manual.  The battery was fully charged which is sort of odd, like someone had just checked it out before shipping.  It has Kit Kat 4.4.2 installed instead of the advertised Jelly Bean 4.2.  Everything else seem to check out like new.

This Tab 3 is about the same width, 2/3"" longer, thinner, and lighter than my well used old 7"" Tab 2.  It even fits in my old 7"" sleeve, barely.  The additional RAM, memory for apps, speed, and larger display makes it a significant improvement over the 7"".  It seems like Samsung have been degrading some features on their newer Tab 4 and Tab A so this 2013 model is comparable to the latest Tab, at a refurbished price.",
"**UPDATE:
6/26/15 Be sure to monitor your tablet within those first 3 months of purchase. The 3 month warranty from Samsung comes in handy. The one I had purchased had a defective battery and charging port the reason it didn't hold a charge. I'd still buy certified refurbished in a heartbeat. Just glad I had the warranty so my tablet got repaired free of charge.

Sometimes newer isn't always better. I decided to purchase a Tab 3 8 inch model instead of the newer Tab 4 due to the simple fact that the Tab 3 just had many more features included at a moderate price vs. the newer Tab 4 which Samsung conveniently took some of the features it offered on the Tab 3 standard and put them all on the more expensively priced Tab S 8.4 model. Many features not present on the newer Tab 4 model such as the ambient light sensor, the 5 MP auto-focus camera, the stereo speakers, or backlit menu buttons. I love this little tablet. It's the perfect size! Though I wish Samsung would consider making a 9 inch version.The tab 3 that I purchased was a certified refurbished and at the price I got it for considering it was previously used, I would have never known had the seller not mentioned it. Overall, great value. If you are considering a Samsung Tablet, look at the Tab 3 model first before committing to the purchase. The tab 4 has a faster Quad core processor vs. Tab 3's dual core processor, however, the faster processor does not make up for the fact that the newer model lacked imagination and character. A true upgrade should feel like an upgrade, not a downgrade.",
"This is OK, I only bought it as my old three year old one broke.  I don't know that model, but it was the same size Galaxy.  I took my old Galaxy to Europe and used it to photograph out the bus windows.  it worked great!  This newer one does not photograph well, is slow to photograph, and takes a lot of fussing around to get it to photograph.  As a basic tablet it's fine, but I miss my old one!",
"I'm sure the tablet is lovely, that is, if it were working. I wondered about the refurbished condition. It did look brand spanking new, just as everyone commented. Unfortunately the touch screen only worked when it decided to. Which was almost never. Same with the menu and back buttons on the bottom. Sadly I had to return it. I will go with the new one next time around.",
"Worked great, for 20 minutes.  Then went into grey striped screen.  Certified refurbished, what a joke.  And to top it off, they are charging me for return shipping.",
"Wow - what a deal!  It said ""refurbished"" but was in spanking new condition to me.

 Love the interface.  It's the perfect size to put in almost any purse and have.  I only have a data plan on
my phone - no wifi at home, and there's some apps I cant use that I'd love to sync with my HTC One phone.
The tablet is fast and looks good; put up too many screens and can't find where to delete them (anyone?)

And, not having to do with the tablet - it's wonderful and I highly recommend DealFisher for their fast shipping and
spot-on products -  somehow I now find my phone's hotspot on when I KNOW I cut off the data plan and hotspot before going to bed.

If anyone knows what the problem is, please send me a comment.",
"The only reason I decided to buy this tablet was because the seller said in the descriptions that It has the 4.2 jelly bean which is flash player compatible, but it came with the kit kat, everything else works and looks great, like new, I didn't return them because they were purchased as gifts.",
"I'm glad I got it, especially for the refurbished price.  After buying this one for my wife, I liked it enough to get another for myself (brown/gold one so we could tell them apart).

I love the 8"" size, and I feel that the added RAM (vs. 7"" model) makes a difference in performance.  I do wish Samsung had done a couple things differently: (a) I wish it was slightly wider, so the bezel around the screen was larger, which would allow it to be held more easily without putting your thumb on the screen. (b) I wish the back was textured (not glossy/slick) so it was easier to hold.  That might also have made ""a"" not as much of an issue.  I did just order a case for it, which may make both of these issues go away, and neither is enough to make me wish I didn't get it.  It's a very nice tablet.

Battery life exceeds my expectation, and I've never felt it was slow/lagging in any way.

The one thing I wish Samsung didn't do, however, is put the menu/home/return buttons outside of the screen.  It does allow more screen space to be used by apps, BUT it's not as intuitive when you use it in landscape mode, and if you flip it upside down, it's quite silly.  But that's Samsung -- they've always done this and continue to do it.

It also comes with quite a bit of Samsung bloatware installed.  Some you can uninstall, others you can ""hide"" (disable)....and some are okay apps.  Once I customized the screen / apps the way I prefer, they're not an issue, but it's just something I thought I'd mention.

The camera is okay -- nothing great, but not terrible.  Outside / bright light is better than indoors, but neither is anything to get excited about.  Video recording is limited to 720p.  I use my phone for my main camera anyway, so this doesn't bother me.

The sound through the speakers is quite good and can be turned up quite loud!  I was impressed.  The speaker placement (bottom, when in portrait mode) means you don't get the stereo effect when in landscape mode, which is kind of dumb, because that's how it would typically be oriented when watching movies on it.

I find it plenty bright, and generally have the brightness set to manual (not auto) and at maybe 20%.  I hate the automatic mode....just like I hate it on their S3 phone.  It has a delay in changing the brightness when it detects a change in ambient light, and it seems like then it just switches between ""too dim"" and ""brighter than necessary"".  Since the level is so easy to manually set (in pull-down tray), that's how I use it.

If you're planning on occasionally sharing it with your kids, like I do, you can set up multiple users and make the kids a ""restricted"" user where you can limit what apps they have access to.  Just beware that, for example, if you give them access to the video player or gallery to view photos, then they can view ANY video or photo on the device.  You restrict apps, not access to locations.  (Fine for me.)

(My only other comment has to do with Android 4.4, NOT this tablet in particular.  Google, for some ridiculous reason, made 4.4 such that apps cannot write to the external microSD card.  They can read, but not write.  Oddly, they can also create a folder, but then not be able to write into it.  System apps (i.e. the file manager app) that come with the device / are part of Android DO have full access to the external microSD card.  That means, for example, if I use my favorite photo editor, I have to save changes to the internal flash, then use the file manager to copy from the internal flash to the external card if I wanted it there.  Likewise for other things, such as the built in ""gallery"" can read/write pictures anywhere, but my favorite photo/gallery app can read/write to internal flash, but only read from the external microSD card.  DUMB.  But that's Android 4.4's fault, not the tablet's.)",
"My first Android thing, auto update to KitKat flawlessly  after I got the tab.  Very happy with this refurbished product, came with cable and wall charger, looked brand new.  Own it for 3 weeks, no issues so far.  Surprise for me...it has gps so I downloaded an app with free maps (soooo easy) and the darn thing continues talking to me in the car without any wifi!  I checkout lots of ebooks for kindle from public libraries but now with this tab I can now access more books as this supports reading any book from Overdrive.  Bought it for travelling (notused as primary computer) and it works great.  I'm a happy camper so far.",
It was ok and worked good,
"Nice size tablet, clear screen, great picture, easy to operate.  These features are excellent and well worth the reasonable price.  BUT, the battery life is TERRIBLE.  Turned on with nothing running, tge battery went from 98% to zero in a little over 3 hours.  If you were actually doing something on if, you would have to have it connected to an outlet.  Other than the battery life, definitely worth the money.",
Excellent picture. Easy to move around channels. Love that it folds up when not in use.,
"This is just what I needed. Big screen, easy to get started and looks great.
Would buy it again.",
"I did not get my RCA under counter tablet from Amz, but I did buy this unit never the less. And what a great idea it is indeed. The base station installs under a cabinet via 4 bolts. This base unit has a built-in counter-top light with three brightness levels as an added plus. The RCA tablet fits into a tablet-holder built into the under-cabinet base station and the RCA tablet gets its power from the under-cabinet base station.  Also, the under-cabinet base station has buttons which control the tablet i.e. volume/on-off. The tablet can be removed from the base station and used independently. Any mini-USB charger will fit the RCA tablet for charging when not attached to the base station. Having this CA tablet & base station is also like having an under-cabinet TV or media player, plus access to videos and email. When not in use, the RCA tablet can be swing up into hiding. My only problems were with the android apps that only run in screen portrait mode. When the tablet is attached to the under-cabinet base station, any apps that force portrait mode will be displayed sideways on the tablet screen. Not good. And the RCA tablet comes with Android version 10 and version 10 will lose support come September 2022. So any apps updated beyond version 10 may not run in this table after Sept 2022. This is probably why the tablet and under-counter base staten combo has dropped 50% in price lately. But until apps stop working with this tablet, this is a good under-cabinet combo.",
Item was returned,
If I could give this give tablet a -10....,
TERRIBLE directions....,
The battery charged okay the first month then it started going downhill. I am lucky to get 20 minutes before it shuts down!,
Touch screen,
works great. my wife loves it.,
My daughter loves to watch tv while she eats!!,
"Speaker dock works well, but battery (fully charged) lasts less than four hours. Everything else is good.",
Satisfactory customer service,
"I bought this for my wife for her birthday and she absolutely loves it, nice picture nice video streaming I would by another one",
I actually love this I bought 2 for the price they were offered,
"pro: great concept
con: just didn't work for what you need and the programming had limitations for what we were needing",
"I normally don't do reviews, but the battery description is very misleading.  This tablet only has a 3100 mAh battery (my phone has 4150 mAh) and you'll never get 6 hrs of use from a charge.  A charge/dischage measuring app I use shows at half brightness and no load, the table still burns over 1000 mA.  Just sitting on standby at half brightness, it will last about 3 hrs on a full charge and you'll be lucky to get an hours worth of normal use.  I'm sure it is fine in it's dock on charge all the time, but if you're looking for something you can take with you...forget this one unless you bring a hefty power bank.  In it's defense it is a nice size, although a bit heavy, and does have enough chipset power to stream video flawlessly.",
"I love having a large screen tablet fully charged when I want to use it. The design needs some reconsideration. The device that holds the tablet is mounted an inch below the cabinet - not attractive. The actual tray that swings down is great when it is down but when you fold it up under the cabinet, it hangs down a little. To fix this problem I'm buying some Velcro to hold the tablet in place when not in use. I would think the designer would've had a way to snap the tablet in a secure position. Something to think about - like it otherwise",
Bought this to use in my master bathroom. Works like a charm. Sound and color are great and internet speed for the tablet is perfect.,
I loved the size and that's about it.  Battery doesn't last long and touch screen is erratic. Not worth the money I spent. Really disappointed.,
"This is great. It synchs perfectly with my Chromebook and my phone. Now I can watch a video, read a book, read a recipe, listen to music or NPR while I cook, and I can carry it around with me too.",
"This unit was on the front porch when I got up this morning. (around 9 - it IS Saturday) I had it tested, configured, installed (and cleaned up after myself) before noon.

I purchased this device to replace a 10+ year old Phillips under cabinet TV/Radio/CD/DVD/iPod dock. For some reason, the under cabinet all-in-one device concept has fallen into disfavor. My preference would have been similarly featured unit, but, if you can find one, it's very old tech or $1100. Since the current items primary uses were TV and Radio, this unit replaced the old one acceptably.  (see caveats below)

Pros:
1. The unit was easy to install with the provided template, however I had to fold the template back a couple extra inches because at its default fold, the dock bumped the wall before aligning with the holes. (I had to drill twice, so I now have four extra holes in the bottom of my cabinet.)
2. The screen is clear and bright and large enough to be fit for purpose in the kitchen, (actually almost 2 inches larger than its predecessor).
3. The sound from the docking unit is clear and the volume can be increased sufficiently to hear above normal kitchen noise. (I wouldn't start the blender, but ....)
4. The fact that the remote also activates the tablet is a plus.
5. The three stage LED light is an unexpected bonus.

Cons:
1. The biggest disappointment is the tilt range. The screen drops from horizontal to vertical (i.e. 90 degrees) only. This makes the screen difficult to view from up close, if you are more than 5 feet tall. I alleviated, (not solved) that by installing the device with no spacers in the front and the tall ones in the back. It helped, but did not really solve the problem. (And it looks like it about to fall off the cabinet even though it is soundly attached.)
2. The tablet is proprietary. The ease with which it connects to the dock is due to the proprietary additions, namely the addition of a four pronged docking port. This may sound like a great idea, but eventually the tablet will wear out and need to be replaced. You will probably NOT be able to get one with the proprietary docking port, and therefore not be able to use the dock. In my humble opinion, the dock should have connected via BlueTooth thereby making it future proof.
3. The dock has no ports. A handful of USB charging ports would have been great.
4. The tablet's USB port is micro USB not USB-C. (Although it DOES have a standard USB socket.)
5. The dock's power supply  is poorly designed. I have a combination 110/USB power outlet where this device is plugged in. The body of the transformer blocks the built in USB ports on the outlet.

Caveats:
1. As noted this unit was purchased to replace an OTA TV/Radio/etc. combo. This unit has neither a TV nor radio tuner.  Fortunately, it is a basic Android tablet. To address the ""radio issue"", I installed an Android streaming radio app. It took several tries to find a free one that didn't accost you with adds.  I ended up with Audials. It is somewhat cumbersome to find your local stations (have to search by call sign not frequency), but once you find and set them as favorites, they appear on the home screen and you're off to the races.
2. The TV question is a bit more tricky. I have an Amazon FireTV Recast (PVR). It has four tuners and works with a FireTV Android app to stream both live broadcasts and recorded content. In our case, i simply installed the app and was able to get very smooth and clear, live and recorded content on the tablet. There is, however, an annoying problem with that app. The app ONLY displays in portrait mode, but the tablet is landscape. This means that you have to chose your tv station by viewing the screen sideways. We'll probably get used to it eventually. We generally only watch CBS anyway, so it will almost always be the first square in the screen.
3. Another approach is to purchase an OTA tuner for Android (about $30). I have one on order. I'll update this review with the results.

Overall, I would have probably been okay with a slightly higher cost on a device with built in tuners, but you have to take what you can get, and this meets (or could be cajoled into meeting) the minimum requirements I established. Since its predecessor was not long for this world I'm keeping this device.

Update: TV Tuner trial. - FAILED
Do not buy the MyGica Tuner. It cannot be installed because the driver is unavailable.",
"4/27/22 My version did not come with 10 it was at 9 and it wouldn't update. Also said last updated in 1969 haha but amazon is sending me hopefully the correct version. other than that slight issue it's a nice combo. Love how it swivels left to right depending on where I'm at in the kitchen/dining room. slight downside to it is that i have low top cabinets so the tablet docks to low and it can't be tilted up but it's my new best friend in the kitchen. Watch my shows while cooking/cleaning!!!
UPDATE 4/30/22: Amazon sent a replacement for the above issue (version on tablet was Android 9 not Android 10 like the product description and cant update) and once again the version is at Android 9 not 10. And version 9 doesn't even support updates or security patches. Google play store doesn't support some apps using version 9, if it was at the 10 version it would support more apps. This is an issue with me personally because 3 apps that are very important to have isn't supported anymore on version 9. But I guess that's what you get for this product to be only 99 bucks. I just don't like that the product description is incorrect and even with getting a replacement to receive the correctly described product the 2nd one was still the same as the first one.",
Omg I love this item it’s in the kitchen. Just wish it had a usb port,
This actually  is a great tablet it integrates my google home devices great and I can access all my nest features including my doorbell cams.  The setup was easy and has a nice led light abound the sink.  The unit is fast and you can use the 128 gb as card as extra storage.  Remember to turn the screen around before you store it and it will lock into place .  I was going to by a tv but this works better and I can stream my tv channels using an hd home run tv network tuner.  Good job !,
I wanted to replace an old kitchen under the counter television.  This tablet works like a smart TV and I'm really pleased with it's functionality and price.  Most models I looked at were much more expensive.  At $99 for the tablet and docking station this works great for me.,
"It is a shame. I ve had an acer aspire 5, it is a good comupter. The one I purchased was refurbished. I regret buying it. It didnt shut down, wouldnt go to start up page.

Had 2 Bad USB ports and needed to contact seller to resolve the issue.,
"Computer was delivered on time this afternoon. The setup was easy and it botted up without any issues.

Would not boot windows and none of the easy fixes worked,
compact but powerful for basic office use,
"Good machine for the price, used in small office setting",
Perfect for a workstation that handles basic tasks. Originally came with the wrong Windows key but support was very quick to resolve that. Would purchase again.,
"Did not meet expectations, poorly written product manual, very difficult to set up.  Not worth the money.  Spend the bucks and buy a tablet that is ready to go once you turn it on.

"2nd Review.
Ridiculous! Try factory reset this computer but keep failing factory reset! Data remove failed!

Comes with a plug that does not fit USA plugs.,
Not a product for the USA.,
Laptop arrived with only European spec charger. Unable to find suitable US charger. Forced to return.,
This computer was shipped to me with international plugs. There was no US adapter. I was forced to return the computer.,
"No US charging plug included, only two European adapters. No specs listed to show wattage requirements so I can purchase a charger. If company sells product in US, it should include proper power supply or adapter.",
Not sure yet.,
I have only had the laptop for a few days and seems to operate as advertised but had to go online and buy an additional power cord specific to this brand and model.  I am guessing I received a European version. Plug attachments are for EU and England.,
This little box ROCKS!  Runs all my MS office software including Teams.,
"I got this cheap on prime day....and all I need it to do is run home assistant. So it technically works for that purpose. There are some major drawbacks though.

There is NO option in BIOS to set default power state to ON in case of lengthy power outages.

The wifi chip isn't detected in home assistant (August 2023 build) however the Bluetooth is. The only way to resolve this is to compile your own Linux image which is more than I'm willing to get into to automate my Lights.

The main board is not removable....the fan is not replaceable...and the WiFi/BT is onboard, not in a M.2 slot.

The included storage is SATA.  RAM is onboard.

If you can live with these limitations it's not a terrible unit. But I would definitely look at this as a fairly disposable product due to extremely limited upgrade paths or serviceable parts. It's unfortunate because the bones aren't that bad especially compared to a Raspberry Pi 4 (which is roughly the same price at the moment) and this is much faster. If I could swap the WiFi card and pop a noctua fan in there it would be a much better machine.",
This item needs to be better made and it fell apart while I was installing it.,
"There's a lot to like about this mini PC. First there's the extremely small size. But don't let that fool you, it's packed with many great features. My 17 year old desktop PC finally died and I needed to replace it. I was looking for two features in a new PC that are becoming almost impossible to find - a VGA port for old-school monitors and an RJ45 ethernet port. The Benss mini PC has both and they work perfectly. Of course, it also has two HDMI ports for newer style monitors so I can upgrade my monitor in the future if I want to. The Benss boots very quickly as you would expect with an SSD drive. It also has two USB 2.0 ports and two USB 3.0 ports for peripherals. I also liked the Windows 10 Pro loaded on the PC. I am not a fan of Windows 11, but it can easily be upgraded to Win 11 by anyone desiring that operating system.

As other reviewers have stated, the only negative is the fan - it is a bit loud, but I didn't find it a distraction. What was more annoying was the fact that the fan is constantly turning off and on as the workload on the PC changes. But I didn't find this to be a deal-breaker. With a PC this small, internal heat would be very destructive so it is reassuring to hear the fan doing what it needs to do.

I also liked the fact that this PC is just that - a PC without all the peripherals. That lets you choose the monitor, keyboard, and mouse that best suits your needs. Laptops are fine because they are so portable, and I have two, but I also like to custom design my main PC that sits on my desk. The Benss allows me to do that. All things considered, I would definitely recommend this PC, especially considering the very reasonable price.",
"Hardware isn’t adequate for windows 11. That’s why the low price. MSI tech told me 90% of his calls were complaints on this issue. Big headache. Windows 10 expires in 2025, then what? Beautiful laptop with big time problem.",
Not an i7 but an i5 and not the hard drive advertised. Very disappointed.,
this pc comes with 512 ssd where as it had 1tb regular hdd by seagate,
"I would have to say these people like so many others selling computers on amazon and I have purchased many over the years are most likely not authorized resellers (however they never said they were.) I say this simply because just like this unit when you buy them the warranty is already expired. Which means it was activated when the machine was purchased by them and not you. Some people might say that’s no big deal and maybe not unless your one of the people that has one blowup after 30 or 60 days when you can no longer use prime for returns. Yes, you can purchase and extended warranty though the manufacture, but you should not have to. Bottom line if you buy a computer from amazon you might want to buy the offered warranty plan because otherwise you may not have one at all.",
T0he only thing that is disappointing about is that the screen has a grid look to it kind of like when you have like a 720p tablet and it like looks a little hazy. The IPS screens are a little disappointing but the color is good it does look very reasonable but I am thankful that the tablet I got for myself has the 1220p. Even at that resolution on an IPS screen it takes away a bit from the crispness. Honestly I think the screens are 720p. It seems like a lie. Over all it's laggy and isn't compatible with a lot of apps. Also the cameras are terrible.,
The laptop does not even turn on. I tried selecting everything hoping something would happen but  it never made it past these screens which basically state it is not a functioning laptop. I needed this laptop in a hurry for work but ended up with $600 worth of trash instead. Will never purchase a refurbished laptop again and PLEASE do not let them scam you!,

"Rev 12/2/21

I was going to wait for a cheap Ryzen 3-based mini PC, but got impatient and took a gamble on this Gigabyte Brix GB-BLCE-4105R, and I'm glad I did. The Intel Celeron J4105 has plenty of processing-power for my purposes, and is rated at 10W power consumption, compared to the Ryzen 3 5400U's 15W. The Brix is made well, although it's tiny. Just use caution when opening it up, installing or removing whatever, and putting the cover back on. Before opening it, I place a light-colored towel underneath so that if I drop any of its tiny screws, they're easy to see, and they don't bounce and disappear forever.",
"If you are planning to buy it for 4k playback, then it's bad news for you. While technically this cpu does support 4k@60 resolution, this unit as a whole really struggles to keep up. You have about 10 minutes of 30fps playback (just enough to test it and think it works) and then fps drops to about 3-5.
The build quality is... Well, let's say you need a screwdriver to take it apart and a pair of pliers and a hammer to put it back together.
The power supply they provide is shady as hell and i wouldn't recommend any one in they own mind to use it.

So what can you do with it?
Emulation wise - you can play up to (but NOT INCLUDING) PSX. Some psx games work but most of them run at 10-30fps.
FHD video - perfect, but in 2020 i wouldn't call it their highest acheavment.
NAS - just don't! Save your time and buy something that at-least supports sdcard to run the OS from.

Raspberry PI can accomplish all of this much better and at a lower price. Depends of-course what arch you need for your project.",

I have not had a need to upgrade as this machine handles everything I need with the added benefit of only using 1/10 of the power of a normal PC.

the only complaints I have the fact that you can't run memory in dual channel and that the heatsink is not aligned with the exhaust ports well causing the machine to run hotter than it needs to (but I never get thermal throttle)",
"First time I bought one and surprise just a year and is useless, terrible support I lost my money on this, get Intel NUC or Asus instead.",
"This is a great little computer if you need something that doesn’t consume a lot of power or break the bank.  I tested it and at idle it consumes only 6 watts.  Under load it wasn’t a lot more.

I’m using this as a Linux Plex server and it works great.  It can do hardware transcoding and can handle anything I’ve thrown at it.  I also tested it doing web browsing and it’s completely serviceable.

It isn’t a gaming machine or a computational powerhouse, but it isn’t marketed as such - and anyone expecting that from a device that costs less than $150 doesn’t have realistic expectations.  If you understand what you’re getting it’s a great little machine.",
"The description is a bit misleading. Although there isn't any OS supplied, don't assume it will work with any OS. The drivers are set up for Windows 10. I wanted to clone an old Win 8 computer with some legacy software, but nope! My computer tech informed me that it's not going to work, and a call to Gigabyte's tech dept confirmed that: it's for Win 10. So I sent it back. Otherwise, looks like a good compact unit.",
"As is often the case on Amazon, there are many reviews at both 5 and 1 stars that defeat the purpose of the review system; to provide real and honest experiences for other customers to consider as they decide to make a purchase.

I hope this one is helpful and counters the 1 star review citing  'barely run windows 10 if at all/Ripoff'.  That is simply incorrect and uninformed.  Long story short I have a fine device for general computing at less than $200 with better / more  resources on-board than the average under $200 device commonly sold on Amazon.

The value that a machine like this has for anybody depends on what that person wants to do with it. It is certainly not a ripoff at the sale price of $127 (that was featured for a few weeks in February .)  The complaint about 'no memory' and  'no operating system' (as well 'no storage') is irrelevant as that is by design .. this is a barebones kit and is intended for a customer that can judge for themselves what they need in terms of processing and what they want to add in terms of memory, storage and operating system.  I added 8 GB of memory ($33) and a 240 GB SSD ($37).  A review of under $200 devices on Amazon will reveal that they feature less memory (usually 4GB) , much less storage (many 'too little' 32GB, others 'functioning' 64 GB or a rare, infrequent 128 GB) and all with less powerful processors (some very much less powerful) that would make for very sluggish performance.  x5-Z8350 and N3060 CPUs are frequently featured and are rated much, much lower than the J4105 processor found in this Brix. I did try a x5-Z8350 last year and had to return it.  Evaluations of CPUs are easily viewed at 'fair estimate comparision' userbenchmark.com.  One could get by with 4GB of memory, but 8 GB makes for a generally smoother experience and is not that much more expensive.  240 GB SSD is not much more than 120 and there is flexibility to go with or upgrade to more storage and or go with less expensive hard drives if that suits your needs (like storing and playing lots of local video'.)

It takes all of 10 minutes to add the memory and storage to this device and anybody could easily do it.  This mini PC works fine with both Windows 10 (free/unactivated) and Ubuntu (free.)  The only caveat that I am aware of with Free Windows 10 Unactivated is a watermark in the lower left of the screen.

I am not a gamer, but if you think that your requirements are high and that high performance is paramount and your main need, then it goes without saying that you understand that this device is probably not for you. On the other hand the claim that it will barely run windows 10 is probably not based on actual experience and does not reflect reality.  I can say from actual use that it runs Windows 10 and Ubuntu just fine.  The past few years I have direct experience with a few carefully selected 'lower end' devices / processors that were used for browsing, streaming, email, spreadsheets, documents and home theater (playing my local video files) and they were all able to run windows and perform the listed tasks just fine .. as did this device.  A quick search on the J4105 processor will bring you to a number of devices that use this CPU and although those devices do have negative reviews for a variety of reasons, none saying 'the cpu cannot run windows'.

I am not an employee of Gigabyte and have never purchased their products. In the past I have purchased Intel NUC kits and Kodlix (under $200 complete systems) and been very satisfied with value and function. In general my impression of Gigabyte is that they are considered a quality brand that will have more positive reviews than negative. I was intrigued by the $127 price ('can that be any good?') as I needed another home theater device so I ordered it (if, in the unlikely case it could not run Windows 10, I would have simply returned it.)  After a week of using this device I am quite satisfied with my purchase and will update this review if I hit any snags.",
"I have had several Dell computers over the years that have held up very well, and the laptops in particular have lasted and performed well above expectations. However, due to reasons, we had to move away from their desktops. So we moved elsewhere for our laptop and tablet needs as well. We have a Hewlett-Packard laptop similar to this one, and I was in the market for another, so I decided to try this Dell and see how it went.

This is a thin, sturdy computer that will run most daily functions for most users. Whether you're up late at night trolling a message board eating Doritos and drinking Mountain Dew, or up early drinking coffee filling out spreadsheets and doing... whatever it is people do on the stock market, this is the versatile laptop that can do those things. I didn't want to install my second Photoshop seat on it, but I tried a couple of other graphics apps on it, and they ran fine for doing things like adding text and other simple editing functions. I tried Sketchup and it ran well enough, but I really needed an external mouse.

I'm getting another business license for MS Office in the new year, so I haven't tried that. I put another office app on, and that one ran fine. Going online is like butter on my favorite browser. I'm not going to try to play Warhammer 40k on this, but I was able to download Steam and play some games with lower system requirements.

It's lightweight, and the power cord isn't bulky, so it's easy to pack it and go. I can fit this into some of my purses. I have a couple of older laptops that are meant to be transported someplace and then put down in one spot for a while, and this is not one of them. You can easily pick this up and carry it anywhere you want. I love the backlit keyboard. The light is dim in most areas where I use it, so even during the day, it's a huge help.

It looks very sleek and professional. You'll feel very comfortable carrying this into an office or school setting. Even someone like me who is always eating at their computer and can't keep greasy fingers off the keyboard and screen shouldn't have a lot of trouble keeping this looking and feeling new.

I love having a headphone jack so that I don't have to rely on battery powered junk that gets lost, I'm pleased to have the USB and HDMI ports, plus an SD card slot, and a security cable slot. I love the SSD 256GB hard drive; if you happen to drop it or it takes a hit, the hard drive won't necessarily fail right away. If you do artsy things with it, or you're just used to having one, the touch screen is a convenient pleasure and can be a bonus when doing those precision artsy things.

I'm not as crazy about the camera and microphone, but it's there if you like to video chat. That's not my thing, so I didn't test it. There's no room here for a DVD drive, but an external one is cheap enough to buy if you need one, and most of the time you won't need it on the go.

That said, it's Festivus, and I do have some grievances. I should probably add that grew up in a systems analyst's household, which is going to affect my opinions about software and hardware. If it were up to me, I would wipe the drives on every computer we own, install Linux and be done with this madness. Since I can't do that, and since you're probably going to be using this as-is, I'm going to tell you what I think of its flaws as I dealt with them.

Initial set up is a pain, mostly due to Windows, but also due to all the bloatware that I have to remove every single time I get a new computer. It takes a bit of time for some of the bloat products to uninstall, and you should plan on a couple of hours for the Windows set up and any updates. McAffee will tell you the sky is falling if you remove it, and it takes longer than the other apps because they're hoping that you'll give up.

In addition to agonizing Windows updates, Dell is constantly pestering me to do updates to its own software. I am not sure what some of this software does except badger me to do updates, aside from Smart Byte, which seems to have something to do with playing video. Over the lifetimes of many Dell computers, some of which lasted over 10 years, I never used Dell Support for anything, and all this help and contact stuff just sits on my hard drives taking up space. If any device drivers need updating, I do that myself.

Usually I like to pop something like this open and install more RAM first thing. The problem with this model is that the RAM is soldered in, making an upgrade impossible. 8GB is what you get and that's the way it is. I don't build these things, so I don't completely understand any technical reasons that might be behind why this was done, but I detest being locked into things like this as a customer.

The speakers are on the bottom, which is not a plus if you want to get full volume out of them. Again, I'm not an engineer and I don't build laptops, so I'm not sure why the speakers couldn't be placed somewhere on top. As someone with ongoing hearing issues, it's frustrating to have all this sound going in the opposite direction of where I need it.

The touchpad is difficult to control for some reason; much more difficult than my HP. The cursor keeps getting stuck in resize mode on the internet and in other apps, and it's hard to get it back into regular clicky mode. Maybe this is a matter of getting used to it, or personal preference. My husband said he also thinks the touchpad on this one is temperamental compared to the other one.

You can bend this backwards until it lays flat, but I'm not sure what the point of this is. Why not make it bend all the way back so that it becomes a tablet if you're going to do that? I can't see myself doing a lot of graphic design on this because the screen is so small. Maybe you could do the basics on this and then move to a desktop for the fine detail work. This is more for taking the files on the go and attaching to a larger screen or projector.

The bottom screws on, so you can't just pop the battery out. You've got to take it apart to do that.

The power adapter slips out of the power port way too easily when I'm not using it on a desk. It's a tighter fit than my other Dell laptops, but not tight enough, and it's going to get looser over time. This may be something I'm doing as a user, but when I use any Dell laptop on the couch, including this one, the power cord tends to wiggle its way out with my movements. I don't think this is roughness on my part since I don't have this problem on the HP.

In spite of my grievances, which some users might not find so annoying, I have to rate this laptop four stars. I would have no problem buying this for my mother, sister or any loved one after having used it myself. The reason is that this laptop comes out of the box loaded with everything you need to get going. You'll only need a couple of hours to set it up (even if it is a pain), and it will be easy for most people to do. Computers are not user-friendly, and I think Dell is trying their best to make them easy to use. If you share my grievances, then you probably know how to get rid of most of them, and you'll still have a great computer. I'm happy to have another Dell.",
So far this may have been the best computer I've ever gotten. It's loaded with features that I love like the backlit keyboard not to mention the i7 processor. It said it very affordable price set up with super easy so far it's definitely five stars.,
"This is a very small laptop that meets my needs for travel, computer use away from a desk, etc.  Speed is fine, keyboard smaller than is quite comfortable.  Nice display.  I would suggest a size up for more ease of use, but the essentials are here.",
"This is a very fast laptop, 13"" with a bright, intensely colored screen with fantastic resolution.
It is light, easy to use, the backlit keyboard is wonderful for working in low light conditions.
It is sleek and looks good.

There is one problem after a few days use.  The ""H"" key sometimes fails to connect or will produce two ""hh""  instead of one.
I am not sure why this is happening, it is random and is annoying but not a ""fatal"" error.",
"This is a nice computer as long as it works. However, mine does not and after spending 50 hours with the Indian Tech Support and sending back to Dell twice, where they did not fix anything I have to write $ 1700 off that I spent on this machine. Still has warranty until 10/2020 !!!!!

I have been using Dell since 2004. This is the last one.",
"This is a review from a decidedly non-techie person. I'm fine with the day to day items such as surfing the web, social media, email, documents, etc. but I am clueless when it comes to understanding specs, setting up computers, getting things to print, etc. That said, this laptop was very easy to set up and start using - same day as delivery. And as I use it, I'm very happy with the speed, screen and sound quality. My husband - who is Super Techie, was almost impressed with this small but mighty laptop. I even heard a hint of envy in his voice as he said it would be a great travel computer. This Dell Inspiron laptop is replacing my Acer Chromebook which I've had for several years. I liked that computer because it was simple, easy to use and offered no unwanted extras. The Dell laptop is maybe not simple, but streamlined and easy to use. I also like the touch screen. I didn't think I'd use it much, but I'm finding that it's handy to have.",
"I am very impressed with this laptop.  My work laptop has a 4th gen i7 with an SSD so I think it is a good comparison for an upgrade.  I was so excited for the quad core i7!  This new processor is so much faster!  From the time you push the button to power it on, until you are logged in is less than 15 seconds!

The included 8GB of RAM (soldered) will be enough for most people, but if you decide later that you need more, it is expandable up to 16GB.

This combination with the SSD and the quad core i7 is a really nice setup.  It isn't going to be good for gamers, with the Intel UHD Graphics 620, but they already know that.

The screen is fantastic!  I was surprised at how great it looks.  It won't be a disappointment.  The speakers are nice as well

Things I feel one should be aware of--there is no Ethernet port, which can be an annoyance.  It doesn’t lay completely flat at 180 degrees, but it is close.

This is going to be a GREAT laptop for most people.  It is light, compact, thin, well made, and reasonably priced for what you get.  I highly recommend it!",
The Dell Inspiron 13 is a super fast and very workable laptop with a ton of extra designed to make your life more enjoyable. Great battery life. Awesome graphics.,
"Description is CPU 3,4Ghz. But actual only 1,8Ghz? Is it correct?
Battery life only around 5h with web browsing only, is it ok?",
"it's a very good laptop, especially for the price.",
"We use our Dell Inspiron 13 7000 7370 Laptop for all of our day-to-day computer chores. It is great for checking email, watching videos, and for our daughter to do her online learning.  It has a wonderful screen, excellent battery life, and plenty of power.

Having said that - we don't use it for some more processor-intensive activities...like editing videos, photos, or hard core gaming (Roblox and Minecraft don't count as hardcore) . I am not saying that it couldn't do those things just that it isn't optmal.

Notes-

- A great blend of utility and value. it combines a great screen, long battery life, with a pretty good value. If this was a Mac this computer would be more than double the price.

- lightweight - which is pretty important if you are traveling with it in a backpack

- More than enough power for most students.

- We have never had a single quality issue..

Final verdict - We have used the  Dell Inspiron 13 7000 7370 Laptop for nearly 3 years without any issues!",
"This Laptop is good only for browsing.
I tried using a collage app from Windows AppStore, nothing was working after that. I had to shutdown using power button.
Tried to copy photos from my Phone, it took hours to display the Photos folder from Phone and hanged several times.
Disappointed with its performance.",
"Purchased the version with I7- 8550u processor and 512 GB SSD.
Purchased a gigabyte USB-c to Ethernet Adapter only to find the network capabilities in this unit is only 100 Mbps. Thought that went out 5 years ago. My wife has a XPS 13 and that does have a 1 Gbps network capability.",
"Very disappointing laptop. For the price I paid I would expect this laptop to function properly and be able to run games several years old. This laptop struggles to play Non-graphics intensive games, or do anything more strenuous than the occasional word processing job. Additionally my computer has a fan issue that just randomly shuts off the computer. And good luck getting useful help from Dell. They have some good people, but overall crappy customer service.  This computer and experience have taught me to never again buy a dell",
"My configuration is a desktop for my main work in the home office and then a laptop for meetings and travel (using OneDrive) - this is a great laptop for the latter.

It fits all the basics I need very well:
- It's lightweight but still has excellent build quality - feels solid and robust and should be able to take some bumps and bruises.
- The keyboard is a good size and comfortable for typing - backlit keys raised a little and nice response feel
- Trackpad works well
- Looks sharp
- It's plenty fast and well powered for business applications.
- Good collection of ports
- Touch screen is a nice addition although not critical since it can't really be used in tablet mode which is where touch adds the most value

Some drawbacks vs. other options (note, these are clear in the spec so they're not worthy of any stars off, but just fyi) -
- The screen can open 180 degrees (i.e., lie flat) but can't go 360 or be removed from the keyboard (like a surface) so it doesn't really work as a convertible tablet or work conveniently for pen input
- The hard drive is nice and fast as an SSD, but at 256 GB it's much smaller than my desktop machine, which means I can't take my entire OneDrive with me

Typical issues:
- There's some bloatware that needs to be removed
- Setup is simple with a Cortana guided wizard right when you open it.  It took about 10 mins of my time to run through it, but then another couple hours of Windows doing updates before it was ready to use, and more time for bloatware removal",
"This is the second Dell Inspiron 7000 that I have purchased in the last 18 months. Both were purchased from a retail, big box store. The first was  a 15” Inspiron 7000 – purchased in January, 2017. The second was this model (the 13” Inspiron 7000) – purchased in June, 2018. The first of the two (the 15”) had a problem charging the battery. I was forced to send it in to Dell TWICE! By the time three months had past, I had only used the laptop for a few, non-contiguous weeks. After the 2nd repair, the laptop has worked well. This past June, the family needed another laptop. I fully believed that the previous experience with Dell was a fluke and had no fear in buying another. Unfortunately, it was not a fluke. A couple of weeks into the new purchase, the screen went very dim and started to flicker. I called Dell and was told that I needed to send the computer in for a new screen. The computer was three weeks old!!! So, now, I’m reliving the same experience. I have owned many Dell computers in the past. Nonetheless, I would be very wary of buying the Inspiron 7000 series. If you do, save all the original packaging to make it easier when you send it off for repairs.",
"Do NOT buy. I got one a year ago. Slew of issues. Would’ve just gotten w a chrome book. Regrets all around. The touchscreen is pretty good, but that’s about where the good ends.

I had been looking for a laptop that was lightweight. Although this laptop is thin, it gets way too hot and there is no ventilation system. The battery life is MAX 3 hours. I first had an issue with the OS. I had to reset and reinstall. Fine, I had one drive so it was backed up ok. Then the WiFi card stopped working. I replaced that. It is not a panacea. I also replaced the battery to see if it would improve. Nope.

Now bc of all the Zoom sh** I’m finding that there are a ton of audio issues whenever it gets too hot. I literally cannot run anything else at the same time. This laptop is a pos and I highly recommend spending a little more for a surface or literally any other laptop.",
"2 in 1 funtionality great. Have had two weeks now, no major issues. Has good speed and responsiveness. Some minor learning with a few of touch funtionalities of Win 10. Hinge is a little stiff, not sure if it will loosen with use. Machine is quite and barely gets warm. The sleep function when just closing lid is intermittent, often shuts down. All in all a nice little machine. I would recommend it based on my experience.

UPDATE: Have had it for a year now. Hinges have remained fairly tight. Did need to send in for fan replacement., it was fast easy and smooth process. It is performing well and overall a nice light duty machine. Also be aware memory is not expandable as is integrated in motherboard. Machine is made in china :(  ((Knocked the star for soldered memory.))",
"Got this laptop four months ago. So far:

THE BAD:
-Loud fan, almost always on while running at more than 65% CPU. Bottom heats up quite a bit as well.
-Sound quality is a little grainy through speakers (perfect through headphone jack).
-Short battery life since new.

THE GOOD:
Everything else.

Great laptop, fast and powerful for the price. Feels sturdy in hand. Screen is glossy and vivid, with good pixel density as well. Haven't had any major problems with it in the past 4 months. There are the minor complaints above, but those aren't getting any worse and they aren't real problems to general use. I've tried a couple other laptops around the same price point before settling on this one, all had major problems in the first month. This one works well, and continues to work well.",
"I'm not a gamer. Just use the laptop for email and light work documents on Word and Excel. The only irritating thing about this unit is the short battery life. Even with my settings set at maximum power saving, I can only get about 4 hours of use before I have to plug it in to recharge.",
"I've had it the 7370 only a few months, and chose it because it had a good processor (i5, 8th gen.), was light weight, and had a good price point.  When using the laptop at a meeting without connecting to the internet, I got about 5 hours' usage on a charge.  However, when using it in a normal office environment (a few applications and browser open), I got only 3 hours' usage from the charge. As one is supposed to disconnect the charger once it's charged, I'll have to keep tabs on the battery : charging when low, and  ""unplugging"" when charged.  Disappointing . . . .",
"*** Disclaimer: I bought this in Best Buy, not Amazon

I've had this laptop for the past couple of months already, and it's been a pleasure to have.

Pros:
- The laptop itself is light, I hardly notice it weighing down my backpack.
- The screen is very responsive, especially if you use a stylus that allows you to use windows Ink.
- The folding screen is really nice when watching movies in bed, I usually put it in tent mode to keep it up right and not have the air vents blocked.
- Dual booting into a unix system is pretty easy.
- The brushed metal finished is very nice, fingermarks don't show up on the outer shell.
- The material itself is pretty durable.
- Lit up keyboard, almost looking like a macbook's.

Cons:
- Battery life is so-so. If you're doing very CPU-intensive stuff, expect it to last around 2-3 hours. 4-5 hours if normal.
- The 256GB SSD is good, but pretty small and doesn't seem like it's possible to upgrade... (I haven't opened it, so can't confirm.)
- The touchpad is VERY VERY sensitive and a bit off-centered. Countless times I've been typing something and suddenly the cursor jumps to the next line because the very edge of my thumb touched the touchpad. It's something to get used to...

Aside from the cons, I've been having a good time with this laptop and would recommend it if you're looking for something in a budget as something you're going to do some programming on.",
"I haven't had a Dell in a few years so I was curious to try this laptop out. Set up was a breeze, only a tiny booklet came with because everything is done online. I did need to create an MSN account which I thought I had but I guess it's too old! The screen size is pretty good for doing daily tasks. I blog on mine as well and live tweet TV shows and the speed is great. I don't use the touch screen much but when I tested it all seemed to work well and was smooth moving around. Cortina isn't my fave, and she pops up frequently (you can disable this but it takes awhile) and the other bother is that with this windows you don't have an icon for short cuts other than the ""e' file. So, no logo pics are on your startup screen. We did look up ways around this (or at least to get an icon up) but it looks rather tedious. I have no idea why they'd not have this feature. It makes your start screen look all the same. The keyboard is comfortable and it has quite a big mouse area. Lightweight and much easier to transport than my older HP.  I use it off power cord for a few hours (7 so far) and it's been fine. The battery charges up fast.  I do wish they'd have a small lip or grip for opening when shut. It can be awkward. Speakers are good, not the best quality.  It's all back lit which is nice, and gives it a lighter 'look"".",
"I've had this computer for over a year and can say that I've never had so many problems with a PC as I have with this one. Right from the beginning, too. This PC doesn't fold flat like a tablet, so you can't hold it and draw or write with the Dell pen. The marketing is misleading, as they make it look like it can fold flat.
Dell installs all kinds of software that clogs up the computer. You'll spend half your time trying to figure out why it's so slow or why it's crashing. I had to reinstall the operating system almost a month after I got the laptop. Dell screwed up the installation of a security feature called BitLocker that left me locked out of the computer.

Now after a year or so, the laptop will randomly blue screen and crash in the middle of typing. You get a stupid blue screen with an unhappy face that says ""sorry, your pc had a problem"" and there goes your work.

One of the biggest issues with this laptop is the power management. When it goes into ""sleep"" mode, like if you walk away from your computer for 10 or 15 minutes, it won't wake up. You have to do a hard reboot, and you lose anything that you were doing. This is a consistent problem that I have every day. Every single day. And since my laptop is now out of warranty, there is nothing I can do about it but deal with the issues until I get another laptop.",
"I love the convenience this petite little laptop offers.  It's quite a bit smaller than my 15"" HP laptop and Chromebooks, though it's not lightweight because of the metal casing.  It has a heft to it, especially for its size.  That said, it still only weighs about 4 pounds and it packs a lot of features into a small little package.  Here are some of our observations:

*  Out of the box, it required a couple of hours worth of updates.
*  It has Windows 10 on-board and we had no issues adding our Office 365 subscription to it.
*  It a face recognition option for security, but you can also assign a pass-code or password.
*  The display is very impressive.  The blacks are very black and colors are very vibrant.
*  The back-lit keyboard is wonderful for browsing in a dark room .
*  They keyboard is pleasant to use.
*  The touch screen is very responsive and accurate.
*  The screen lays nearly flat, but does not fold all the way around to enable it to be used as a tablet.
*  It works well with an active stylus for sketching and navigating.
*  We haven't noticed any issues with WIFI capability.
*  Streaming is a delight.  The picture, again, is bright and vibrant.  This is where I go when I want to stream something by myself.
*  I typically have numerous tabs and multiple programs active at any given time and it handles all the traffic very easily.
*  Uploads and downloading speeds are respectable.
*  You can use either tethered earphones or Bluetooth enabled gear.
*  It has two USB 3.0 ports, a USB Type-C port as well as an HDMI port and SD card slot.
*  It boots up fast thanks to the solid state drive.
*  It hold a decent charge, but when I'm streaming, I tend to keep it plugged in.
*  The battery is neither removable nor replaceable.
*  The charging port is proprietary.

This little Dell has become my ""go-to"" when I need to look up recipes in the kitchen.  It's also a convenient portable media player and I always have it on-hand when we're watching TV.  It's also perfect for streaming the shows that no one else wants to watch - especially in bed, when my spouse is asleep.",
"Despite the revolution of smartphones and tablets, still there is a need for traditional computing powers for many who work with extensive data and graphics. One of the most important elements of today’s computing is mobility – where you can just pick up your laptop and go without worrying about weight and size. Therefore laptops like this have become more popular and the companies like Asus, HP, Samsung, and Dell have taken notice.
This Inspiron 7000 series (this model is 7370) competes with Asus Zenbook 3 series and HP Spectre series. Choice is a good thing of course. Therefore ultimately it depends on your preference which laptop you should choose. I also own Zenbook 3 (i5, 124 GB, 8GB RAM) and so I can make a decent comparison.

PROS:
1. SCREEN. The screen is gorgeous. It is bright and because it is FHD (Full High Definition 1920 x 1080) it is a visual treat. I realized that once you go FHD it is very difficult to go back to regular HD, (I also own Dell Latitude E5430 14” 1366 x 768, while it is a very good notebook, the screen is not as good as 7370). Zenbook 3 is also FHD and they both are great for work and watching movies.
2. THIN & LIGHT. It is really thin (.61inches) and light (3.09 lbs). For a laptop, this is compact and light enough to take it anywhere. Zenbook 3 is also 13.3” screen, yet is bigger than Inspiron 7370 because it has bigger bezel around the screen (and little heavier too, 3.3 lbs). It fits into smaller laptop case with no problems.
3. STURDY. The notebook made from aluminum, while light, it is strong. Another thing I really like about Dell products is that they have great hinges. They are strong and they do not break easily (as Zenbook 3 series did – a common issue – due to design flaw). If you tilt your screen to your liking, it will not wobble – not the case with Zenbook 3.
4. PERFORMANCE. Armed with 8th Gen Core i5 and 8GB RAM, most of your programs and apps will run smoothly. I had open MS Office 2010 (Word, Excel), YouTube, Kindle reading app, and several browsers (Edge, Firefox, Opera) at the same time, and the programs ran just fine. However, as you know, this laptop cannot be used as a dedicated gaming console. I have no issues with performance for my daily tasks.
5. FACE RECOGNITION. It comes with Infrared Face Recognition (part of Windows 10 that utilizes the hardware), and it works fast and well. Although Finger Print sensor would have been nice, but Face recognition is actually cool. I have come to enjoy it.
6. TYPE-C PORT. This is option is great for connecting your phones, and other mediums (fast transferring data), however please note that this cannot be used as charging your laptop's battery (UPDATE - 1/15/18: It does recharge the battery when the laptop is OFF, but slowly. But when the laptop is ON, it does not recharge, but drains the battery slowly than the normal - depending on the usage. For example, I have noticed that if you watch YouTube, then battery is drained slowly, but when you work on the Word, the battery percentage has been steady).

CONS:
1. TOUCH PAD. Because of its smaller size, the necessary compromise is that Touch Pad is smaller than the competition (Zenbook 3 is actually quite nice). But if you use a mouse, then this is a moot point.
2. FAN NOISE. Occasionally, you will hear a fan noise. Not a lot, but you will notice it.
3. ONLY 2 USB 3.0 PORTS. This is due to inclusion of Type-C Port. So if you use many USB related devices, then you need to get a USB hub.
4. SPEAKERS ON THE BOTTOM. The speakers are located on the bottom of the laptop, I thought this was unusual. However, the sound is clear and loud enough.

Overall, I like this laptop, I am using it as a desktop, and love the screen and performance. So if you are in a market for a compact laptop with power, great screen, and sturdiness, then consider this one too along with the competition. You will not be disappointed. Recommended!",
awesome!,
"battery is failing, very low range and it is not smooth running with Autodesk Inventor 2018",
Only lasted a year and a half.,
I just bought this and it came without a battery! What am I supposed to do? How can that even happen?,
Its too much expensive,
Video Player is loading.,

Nice,
Good,
"I've had this computer for not quite two years and the power supply is shot. Otherwise a decent machine, but it's no longer a portable device.",
Awesome product and service,
"Less then a year and the laptop not charging. And if I want fix the problem it's around 200$!
And the company support service is bad. Never again Dell",
"Very light and fast with ssd memory.
I love it.",
"Is inspiron 5000 not inspiron 7000
Received inspiron 5000, specifications do not match",
"slim, solid feeling and fast laptop. works well for all day-o-day computer needs",
Trackpad is failing after only 1 month.  I will return this as it is of poor quality.,
"Perfect size, touch screen, SSD drive , great product, great support.",
No touchscreen comes on this model.  Also during setup dell site said my new laptop was out of warranty for 3 months.  Someone had registered it over 1 year ago.  The replacement for the first one that also had no touchscreen.,
Video/photo editing is a hobby of mine and this Dell serves me well.,
"Powerful, light, looks great. It’s what I have come to expect from Dell. Great support services.",
"Muy rápida y fácil de manipular , muy buena",
Works really well. No issues. Light weight and portable. Love the size.,
Got it and speakers were bad. I bought a set of Bluetooth ear buds.,
"I bought this computer thinking the features include touchscreen because the specifications said so , but when I got the laptop turned out that was not touch, I lived out of USA so the returning of the product is expensive, so I just decided to keep the laptop without the touch screen feature",
"skip this.  This computer arrived out of warranty.  obviously either not new or a very old model

update
this item arrived with the box looking like it was kept in a garage shop.  filthy.  after returning am told i did not return item in good condition.  unbeliveable",
We received the item USED instead of new one. This information was provided by DELL support. In 6 months laptop stoped working and we can even copy the data because SSD is encrypted by BitLocker. Also from the day one dynamics didn’t work. I believe seller selling used/broken items,
After two years updates triggered bit locker to lock me out of my computer. Dell then offers to sell me the recovery key for  a hundred dollars. Its a built in hustle no honest manufacturer would stoop to. Dell is not an honest buisness.,
"A pesar de los cuidados en abrir y cerrar, hace un mes al abrirla la pantalla se rompió.  No la recomiendo.",
"This is a great laptop when it works, I was very happy with it until it died suddenly. The power supply board broke. Dell replaced it and when it came back the processor fan is dead. I don't know how this passes Dell's repair checks, but it shows how badly run Dell's technical support is. Hire competent people instead of outsourcing to badly trained idiots.",
"The laptop is nice but it had a weird problem with the sound. When playing videos, it would freeze and make a buzzing sound. I got a replacement and now the replacement has a different sound problem. The playback sound is now distorted. I do not like how the laptop gets hot so easily.",
"This laptop is gorgeous. I absolutely love it. The display is large and crisp, and the keyboard is nice and roomy. The bottom is a little thicker than I was expecting, and it's a little heavier overall than I thought it would be. It's still a great product.",
It is nice product.,
"Lighweight, fast and furious. i5 processor is good enough for a decent home use, excluding games. Didn’t try games on this yet.
Downside as of now is only the vents give out a lot of heat, but may be its good and keeps the laptop cool. Keeping on your lap may be a problem.
Overall good buy and recommended as a daily driver.",
Love this little computer! Super lightweight and stylish. Much better than my last which was 15in and older. Have to get used to not having the CD/DVD drive tho. Does get pretty hot when playing a game I downloaded tho so i got a laptop cooler with fans and it works like a charm!  Hope it lasts as long as my last Dell!,
The product itself was good and Battery did not work but as usual Amazon handled the problem satisfactorily,
I dislike a lot of things from this dell computer. The computer would not keep a charged an it would give me errors all the time. I constantly took it to get maintenance.  It would freeze up while I was using it and I just use it for school so I did not have a lot of memory downloaded in it. Whenever I would use the touch screen it seem to provoke the computer to freeze and act up so eventually I stop using the touch screen part of the computer to avoid any problems.,
"I do not recommend this product. After 1 and 1/2 years the touchpad is popping out due to faulty battery.  The battery is just below the touchpad and over the year it has swollen up and pushing the touchpad out. The only way to fix it, you have to send the laptop to dell or replace the battery by yourself and the cost of the OEM battery gonna be close to 100$. This issue is persistent throughout the years and there's no reasonable fix from Dell.",
Very nice to be able to turn on a computer and have it almost instantly booted up. Still astonished at the speed of SSD. Screen is also the nicest I’ve ever owned and the keyboard nicely lights up.,
"The computer is light and generally works well.  There are 2 features that are a problem.  First, the backspace key often does not work until the cursor is repositioned - even if it is already in the correct position.  Second, and most importantly, the hard drive is not sufficient.  Unfortunately, when I bought the computer there was no configuration that offered the speed and size with an adequate hard drive.",
my biggest issue is that the laptop can't even handle basic phone photos in the default program... crashes just about every time and is really slow to load and move through photos. not much better in other programs. gets frustrating but otherwise a great laptop.,
"I just returned the Inspirion and ordered a Lenovo instead.  I had a lot of trouble with the connection to the wifi, it kept dropping off.  I tried to solve this problem for a month (hours on the phone with Verizon, bought a new stronger modem, even took the computer to a lab...) but nothing worked. At the office wifi was not a problem, but at home it was.  Now with the Lenovo the home wifi works fine.
Otherwise its a nice computer, good-looking, nice screen (I loved the click of the keys :-) but the wifi ruined it for me.  I haven't seen other complaints so maybe it was a problem that's unique to my home, but since the Lenovo works fine I can only conclude it has better wifi connectivity.",
"The laptop has a short battery life.  It needs to be connected to it's charger most of the time or it draines fast.  This is using only for documents and simple tasks, not for videos or large folders. Also, after about 10 minutes, the drive begins to make this sound which would be disruptive in a quiet environment.  I'm seeking a return/exchange.",
"This laptop is supposed to be our travel pc, when we go out of town so it was very, very seldom used. Then I realized what if it breaks before the warranty expires? So I asked my daughter to boot it up once in a while or use it for browsing the internet. A few days later, the Dell suddenly wouldn't boot up. It did a self-diagnosis and returned all green checkmark results but it keeps getting stuck in the repair mode afterwards. After spending an hour troubleshooting with a tech support, he decided that I send it back to Dell for repair.

After a week we got it back. I turned it on and it did the WIndows 10 updates. The next day the problems started again. Again it wouldn't boot up. Their Tech Support again help me troubleshoot but there is really nothing you can do to try to bring a defective unit to life. The laptop is still with Dell as of this review. It's probably the SSD with faulty boot sector that's causing the problem but they should really do extensive testing before they send those units out especially after ""repair"". Will I buy a Dell again? NO. Will I recommend a Dell to a friend? Nope!",
"My laptop has multiple issues. The graphics card overheats so I am forced to throttle it to 85%. In addition graphics frequently fails when I'm browsing the internet and I need to restart.

The other problem is that the screen doesn't turn on properly when waking up from sleep. I frequently have to do a force shutdown with the power button and reboot it in order for the screen to activate.

It is very sleek and shiny though and the ssd loads everything super fast.",
I got this laptop for college and it has been working great so far there are only a couple of complaints I am having right now sometimes the touch screen does not work and also if I press on the part of the screen where the camera and other sensors are I can feel the screen move back I'm not sure if that is part of the design or if my computer came defected also the first day I got it the fan was making this really weird noise. Otherwise the computer starts up fast and is very quick at doing normal tasks.,
I got this computer a year and a half ago and I've been using it for school. It's light and easy to carry with me to my classes. My problem is the battery life. Fully charged and on battery save mode I only have one hour and 45 minutes of power. It's really difficult to bring my computer around school with me because it's power will only last me through one class. I'm not sure why the battery went downhill so quickly after buying it but it is frustrating. As long as I can find a plug it's fine though.,
"Bought it to replace a similar model that had tablet mode but developed a broken hinge. This one is smaller (but same screen viewing area), lighter and hinges appear sturdier. Great computer. Getting used to not having the touchscreen, but it pisses me off that the Amazon product specs claim that it has one. Be very careful when you buy a computer to check that it actually has everything claimed. Once you open the box, it's very hard to return it.",
"This is a small, light and well built laptop. Aesthetically, it looks pleasing and the touchscreen works nicely as well. It serves my wife's daily needs of documentation and internet surfing pretty well. However, we haven't tested it for computationally heavy software so can't really say about that aspect.

On the flip side, this laptop doesn't have 3 usb ports as advertised.  There are 2 usb ports, one HDMI port and one SD card reader.  I have attached images for reference.",
"Nice little laptop. Great for everyday use. You might notice some lag if you have too many programs open at once, but nothing that will be a deal breaker. IR camera is pretty neat and works accurately. Screen is very nice and displays accurate colors; touchscreen is an added bonus.  Doesn't get too warm when being used heavily. Only real con that could be a deal breaker is the weak battery life. Unless you have the battery set to “battery saver,” expect to charge up after about 5-6 hours of moderate use.",
"Really thrilled with my Dell Inspiron 13 7370. Handles anything I've thrown at it and wasn't ridiculously expensive like a MacBook or even a Dell XPS 13. Build quality is great, however, there are uneven gaps where the frame meets the bezel, but that is nitpicky. The touchscreen is very responsive, but doesn't work 100% of the time. However I do believe that is a software issue and not a hardware issue. This laptop doesn't cut any corners, and the price at the time of purchase ($799) was unbeatable. Recommended this to some of my friends and they love it as well.",
"+ This laptop is well built.
+ Beautifully designed with some nice subtle CNC decoration at edges.
+ Good touch screen.
+ Color accuracy is so so, acceptable for most user.
- Screen is a little dim, also you need to do some research to turn off the featur",
"Aesthetically, it's fine.  Not pretty, not ugly.  I'm fairly certain it's the same as the equivalent hp, like exactly the same.  The edges can actually be sharp, which is weird, especially right where you tend to rest your hands most.

Keyboard I'm actually happy with.  Typing is what I do and this keyboard is well laid out, despite being a 13"".

Trackpad is trash, but they all are, so whatever.

So all that is good for a solid 3 star review for mediocre laptop.

Now I have to bring it down to two because of the failure to resume.  Upon doing some research, it seems to be a known issue, but I haven't been able to discover a fix.  So close the lid?  Maybe it'll resume, maybe it won't, and I'll have to hard boot.  Walk away for a few minutes while it's on battery?  Maybe it'll resume, who knows.  And sometimes it does resume, after one or two minutes.  And I'm talking a legit 60-120 seconds, which is absurd.  I can hard boot it in 20 seconds from start to finish, so having to sit and wait for it to resume is just crazy.  But then it just doesn't resume at all sometimes.  I shouldn't have to open my laptop, hit keys, and then go make a cup of coffee, and hope I come back and it's on.

Batter is wildly unpredictable.  Will go from 30% to 5% in a heartbeat, and it's otherwise meh at best.",
"Great little laptop. I wanted something light and slim and this fits the bill.  The battery life lasts a while as I actively am working and can go a whole day in my purse just fine. It does have a louder fan than most, but it hasn't bothered me at home or during travel.",
"I don't like this laptop and wouldn't recommend it unless you can deal with:
when it heats up, the fan will make a really annoying noise. I've had laptops that heat up and I would hear the fan cooling the laptop, but it's usually a really subtle, light sound. This fan makes a sound that is unbearable. I've had to stop what I was doing on the laptop ( when I was at a meeting )to turn the laptop off so that it can cool quicker. Even with the noise, the fan still won't cool the laptop effectively and efficiently. It takes really long for it to cool unless you turn off the laptop. The fan is basically useless.

Also the speakers are at the bottom of the laptop. I need to invest in good speakers if I'm going to watch a lot of videos or tv. The sounds quality is not the best either. At sound level/volume 100, it makes this weird echo noise. It actually hurts my ears sometimes when it's at the highest volume, but I don't really have a choice, because otherwise I would have trouble hearing at any lower volume.

Besides the two main cons above, overall this is a decent laptop. It's relatively light and it can convert to a tablet (rarely use it in tablet mode because this would be a heavy tablet). I was never a touchscreen person, but after this laptop I actually fell in love touchscreen monitors. The computer starts up really fast. The face recognition is efficient too.

At this price, I would recommend just saving a bit more and get a nicer laptop. It's definitely worth the investment. This was in the upper middle price range, and it's more difficult for me now to get rid of this laptop and get another more expensive laptop. At upper middle price range, you might as well go to the A laptops.",
"I bought this computer about 6 months ago (black friday deal) and waited to write a review. I love this computer. Very easy to set-up from opening the box, very quick response time to opening programs, long battery life (was at half battery after 4 hrs not plugged in), and great size/weight ratio. I use this computer primarily for work and school and watching videos. Also, I used to be an avid HP supporter, but now Dell has converted me after this experience!",
"Do not purchase this model laptop. Within less than a year of buying it I was having problems. The laptop was not waking up from sleep mode so I had to restart it if I wanted it to wake it up. I had to replace the battery because it got swollen, possibly because I live in a hot climate and sometimes the air circulation to the laptop wasn’t so great) and now that I’ve done that, the laptop still gets hot and shuts down before there is an update. It takes me about 3 hours of turning the laptop on and off before it reboots. I wish I had done more research before buying this otherwise I would have seen all the complaints in the forums. It was within my budget, sleek looking and would have accomplished the things I needed it to, now I need to look into buying a new laptop that is not a Dell because I don’t trust the brand anymore. Dell should really take this model off the market.",
"Ironically, it took a pandemic (Covid-19) for me to finally bite the bullet and invest in a better laptop. My laptop was getting slow and having difficulties maintaining a charge. So, I ordered the Dell Inspiron laptop computer to dedicate solely to my teleworking (i.e., job).  Understand that this review is strictly from this perspective. I wanted something reliable and easy to use. I wanted something that allows me to connect remotely to my work computer and where I can surf. This does the trick. It is:

Easy to setup.
Comes preloaded with various programs.
Charges quickly.
A convenient size. Not too big or too small.
Touch screen. The screen is super clear and bright.
It has face recognition which offers extra security.
Has a long (charging) cord.
Can install additional programs easily. *I was able to add the programs needed to connect virtually to my work computer.
It is lightweight and fits easily in a large purse or laptop bag.
It has additional ports (i.e., C-port, USB, headphone, etc.).
It comes with a microphone and speakers.
I know some have complained but my fan is quiet/silent.

In conclusion, for the price and what I needed it for (I’m NOT a tech person), this laptop is perfect. I’d recommend it.  4 stars",
"I wanted a lightweight, small size laptop that I can use for web developer work. I upgraded from a i5 dell with a traditional hard drive that just crawled when doing development on Microsoft's .NET platform. This thing is perfect! The SSD and i7 combo FLY! I have never used a computer that is so fast and smooth with Windows 10. The most annoying parts are just normal Windows issues. A million updates to apply when you first turn it on. Turn it on in the morning and give it all day to do it's thing the first time through. I would have liked the page up and page down buttons in the normal spot, but I get it, they wanted to keep this thing small. Its just a little bigger and thicker than an iPad 2, but its a real, full blown machine. I have tested .NET and MEAN stack development and both are lightning fast. The touch screen is nice too and the facial recognition is not so great honestly, feels gimmicky. This is NOT a good computer to store your entire music collection or a bunch of movies on. The hard drive is plenty large for a developer or for just doing art work or browsing the web. Although speed-wise you could run Cubase or another power DAWs on this, it really isn't ideal due to the hard drive space. For me, though, its perfect!",
"This is great little laptop.  Great to get a machine with a 8th gen quad-core processor at this price!  Appears that you can do fingerprint or face recognition as a second-factor authentication as well, although I have not tested that yet.
Color, brightness and clarity on the screen is excellent, and its a touchscreen display.  I was nervous before seeing the screen in front of me, but nothing to worry about there!
You do not see too many machines at this price point with a durable aluminum chassis either.  It's like a mini Macbook Air..great build quality.
Very little bloatware installed....I only saw McAfee and MS Office 365 trial software.
I can highly recommend this machine!",
This keeps your cords organized so when they are not in use you can easily hang it and keep it in sight so you can easily find it each time u need to use them. This is easy to apply to your table or nightstand. If you have multiple cords I recommend buying a few of these. And with the price it's affordable to buy quite a few.,
I hate an untidy desk and looking at unsightly cords all over the desk just bothers me. This is very easy to stick where you need it. It comes with strong 3M tape. It is easy to put cables in it and holds them really good. It is well made and a very nice quality.,
"Finally no more tangles with my cables with this cord organizer.
I was having a hard time trying to figure it out which cord was which and now my life is easier thanks to this, and they stay in place and won't fall or move.
Affordable and innovative device, very good quality!",
"Good price for a entry level laptop for lightly usage such as browsing, watching movies, some MS office stuff with good battery life.",
"The notebook is fantastic. Totally unnecessary to waste ""millions of dollars"" on an Ipad or Mac book air. And the price is a steal.",
"The Transformer Book feels like the evolution of a netbook, yes those 11 inch laptops that were a thing back 5 years ago.  The ASUS Book Flip comes clean with no bloatware.

The Pros:
1) Small form factor with 11.6 inch screen
2) 2 USB ports (2.0 and 3.0), and USB type-C.
3) Touch screen
4) 360 degree keyboard, meaning you can turn all the way around
5) Bluetooth and wifi
6) 33W power, mean you can use webcams, usb hubs, things that need juice without hurting the laptop's battery

The Cons:
1) Display is only 768p
2) Glossy display, which makes it hard to see in bright settings
3) 32GB space.  After Windows 10, updates, some files (not software), you're basically almost have no space left.
4) Fingerprint magnet all over except bottom.

So so:
1) The Intel Celeron N3050 has turbo upto 2.16ghz, but not sure if this helps much.  Feels adequate.
2) 2GB ram may be just enough to do web browsing and youtube.  But any multitasking will feel laggy.
3) Mouse pad can feel finicky and clumsy.

The ASUS Transformer Flip is a decent computer for basic usage.  Don't expect it to do anything intensive or graphic.  Its basically for editing documents, watching videos, and doing web browsing.  But for $200 you get what you pay for.",
"got this for my daughter, she loves it.",
love it,
Recommend it.,
Excellent,
Nice works smooth,
very good. I love it.,
"Loved it! Sleek, responsive, and sharp.",
Great product at a great price!,
Great deal. Better than a android tablet.,
Perfect for school and doing work,
Purchased for my granddaughter she loves it,
Didn't charge,
No good,
Great price. Just wish the processor had a little more umph!!,
Great Product that is able to expand storage up to microSD 128GB.,
crappy computer i would not buy again.,
My daughter loves this flip book.  I would recommend it.,
Nice lightweight and inexpensive laptop replacement with a longer battery life.,
Charger and charger imput broke already and ASUS is giving me the run around to fix it!,
My niece is in love with it. She use (abuses) it 4 hours a day.,
"This transformer book can't even run office without crashing.
It is either a defective product or made with low-grade hardware.
Stay away!",
DO NOT BUY THIS!!! Won't even connect to the internet consistently. Not responsive. Windows open all over the place randomly. It's is useless.,
"Charger lasts a year though,  get a backup before it stops working .",
"Broke twice in 2 months, first time loose connector inside, fixed it. This time can't do anything to get it started... I don't recommend this product.",
"The laptop cover was scratched is unacceptable, I want my money back or a change",
"Ordered this so my 8-year-old daughter could learn how to use a computer. She loves it, though RAM is a little insufficient",
So far its awesome and I love that it has a touch screen that works like a tablet...the price was excellent too!!! No complaints,
Wonderful product.  Love how expensive and professional this laptop looks for such a great price.  Touchscreen works great so far. Very smooth and easy transaction.,
"Don't buy any ASUS laptop with their proprietary square power adapter, eventually they will stop working and wont charge the Flip book.the connection to the laptop eventually will wear out and you're done.",
No stars. When is wasn't updating - it was slow as molasses and in less than 90 days it died completely. Refund window too short for this truly poor product. I've had disposable cameras last longer.,
"Easy to carry, lightweight, touchscreen works well, good quality feel. For the amount of storage space it works very well.  Not storing documents on it.  Use mostly for browsing Internet, email, watching videos and creating documents.",
Great graphics. A little slow at processing.,
"This tiny little thing is wonderful! I just want to watch shows and email, maybe a quick search, and it does it all. Great price, great shipping. If I needed more I would buy many and now! thanks!",
Fast shipping arrived in great condition. plugged in laptop and recharged battery overnight. Next day turned on  Computer and started Windows 10. About 5 minutes into program screen blinks and goes into a faint blue. Tried everything to restart Windows no luck. Retuned for credit.,
I have just received my asus...so far I like it...will see how it goes....,
Basic 2 in 1. Would be super better with ran upgrade. Going for more tiday.,
"I received the package - looked a little beat up.  Same with the box holding the product, but no evidence of damage to the computer. Sadly, 21 of the keys not the keyboard did not work.  Have to return it.  Disappointed.  May try again another time.",
"Update:
This thing only lasted a few months before turning off completely and NEVER COMING BACK ON! Other's reviews about the small amount of space is true. I am not sure if that fact had anything to do with my system completely crashing, but I wouldn't be surprised. Don't buy!",
very low,
"The product was great, right up until it suddenly stopped working for no apparent reason about ten days after I could have returned it.  Two hundred bucks in the garbage.",
Very happy with this little computer. I was looking for a light weight one to replace a heavy lap top I used for travel. This one fills the bill. It does everything I need it to do...I use up to eight tabs open at a time and it does not seem to even phase the machine. Will cloud storage it does not matter that it do not have unlimited storage. Very satisfied.,
I guess I shouldn't expect too much since it is only a flip book,
For the price and MS suite it is a decent value. can't upgrade ram really limits its potential.,
"This is deserves -1 star.  We would have returned it but we went out of the country and ran out of time.  It is extremely slow and unresponsive with any software.  I don't know why this exists.  ASUS should be extremely ashamed for obscene, degenerate act of a product.  Goodbye forever ASUS.  I will pass this on to everyone I meet.  It is a waste of the electricity and resources that were used to produce it.  Shame.",
"The laptop is lightweight and lasts for 8hours or so. But functionally it's extremely limited. Simple things like Microsoft office are also difficult to use. The laptop keeps crashing. The support team is also not as useful to deal with this issue.
At first I was happy, but after a month of use, I feel I would have not bought it. Amazon needs to extend the return policy on such items at least 3 months to understand if the items work properly or not.",
"It's a piece of junk.  The power button is easy to see how it could/would get broken.  The graphics driver crashes even when reading an article on the internet.  Upgrading to windows 10 leaves you with little hard drive space.  This looks nice, but it isn't a product that has any longevity.  It froze after a week and couldn't repair it.  The technician told me to press f9 repeatedly and just a cycle of asus logo and blank screen.  Not impressed with asus products.",
"Purchased this computer less than a year ago, it worked great for my son's college classes. He pulled it out of the computer case and plugged it up and it will not charge. Called Asus and they say it's not under warranty and we will have to pay to ship it back to them and then they will tell us the problem and what it will cost to fix it. Local repair shop says the charging port is burnt out and it will be $160 dollars just for the part. I dont recommend buying this computer because Asus will not stand behind their products.",
"Purchased the laptop from Amazon Warehouse Deals. Was described ""Like New"" with only damage to packaging. Delivered fine and looked good when opened. However, when booted up, a large chunk of the keys did not work. I tried troubleshooting myself, and called Amazon Tech Support who determined the keyboard was faulty. Will be returned first thing in the morning.

 Also I tried to reset to factory settings since I made it through setup, and as we speak it has yet to reboot after an hour or so. It has stalled at the startup screen. Be careful if purchasing anything but New condition.",
"Wow, what a total piece of crap! Endless windows 10 updates that fail to load, now stuck in aptio setup screen and won't load OS. I would give this a firm do not buy. I would have been better off with a used older generation samsung tablet.

Edit: ran ubuntu off a usb stick, figured out the EMMC(like a hard drive only soldered to the board and not replaceable) is dead...not happy about this purchase at all. Refund window is just shy of product life. It will boot from usb or microsd, but if you want memory or regular functionality you're SOL!",
I have had this laptop for about a week there is a problem with it restarting when you flip it to a tablet. I am having a wifi problem that could be software related.,
"This is a sturdy notebook and works great for lightweight uses.  Great price for the quality.  I use it primarily for internet surfing, although I loaded Office Professional 2016 with no problems.  I also bought a 64 GB sandisk for additional storage.  Keep in mind, it only has 2 GB of RAM memory and 32 GB of internal storage.  I don’t intend to use the device as my primary computing machine, but it works great for my uses and you can’t beat the price for the quality.",
"Good product for the price.  However, the touch screen doesnt work so well.  Overall, if you want a cheap device to do e-mail, browse internet, etc. its a fine product.  Also, ive dropped it a couple of times and nothing has happened which is great.",
"Up and running right after being received. And for my money this Transformer Book Flip is a best buy in tablets/laptops. Great utility with an 11.6 inch screen and the cover rotates 360 degrees, too. And this PC is a touch screen laptop or  tablet. It's got everything I wanted or needed: Bluetooth, WiFi, able to stream videos, very fast Win10 start ups & a year of Ms Office, real keyboard, a USB2 & USB3 port for an extended HD. And very light as no where near as heavy as a laptop.",
"If you can get past the track pad alone, it is okay as a portable, but Windows 10 and the insistence of staying online, waiving privacy, and signing up with Club Microsoft just to use this thing as an imperfect wordprocessor is a huge turn off.",
Not sure if this is an ASUS problem but most likely a packaging issue.  The box was opened when received and left on our doorstep so we could not refuse it.  Once we opened the computer itself we found that it was damaged and after talking to ASUS we were told to send the new computer back to them so they could repair it.  We have to pay shipping to get it back plus now we have a new (repaired ) computer.  Not what I wanted or expected.,
"I was needing a laptop/tablet to do some online classes to finish up my degree.  This is perfect for what I needed.  It has very little bloatware, boots up quickly.  Im able to get online do my work and be done anywhere.  I use my samsung s5 as a wifi hotspot and it works perfect.  Im not a computer gamer and I haven't loaded it up with a bunch of applications or programs, just online classwork,  amazon shopping, research, writing papers and reading.  No issues with any of that.  So for the $199 I paid it is 5 stars for me.",
"I wanted a small, light touch screen display for presenting my portfolio of photography and video not for high performance editing or gaming.  Am more than happy with the purchase based on the higher than expected image quality of its display and its light weight.
Con: Has very limited memory but adding capacity is as easy as adding a micro-SD card or a USB drive.  I opted for the micro SD card.  I plug a wireless mouse USB plug into one of its two USB ports and I've got easy access to bright images and video as well as internet access in a light, easy to carry and inexpensive display with keyboard.",
"I use it as an ""on the go"" computer for school. I still have my computer at home but this serves well for what I need it for. Easy to take notes in class because it's small and lightweight, takes up less room in my bag than a book. The touch screen is amazing. I expected it to be a little choppy but it's actually very smooth. Very happy with the windows 10 system as well. I have a stylus and it seems to respond better to that than using touch. Using touch it works most of the time but there have been a few times where it didn't read or it would click instead of scroll or something to that effect but using the stylus fixed that. Overall very happy with it.",
"Don't buy it. There isn't even enough room on the device to install security updates for Windows. Of course, I couldn't even upgrade to Windows 10, so now I get all kinds of security warning messages that tell me my computer may be at risk because I don't have the most up-to-date version of Windows. Maddening. Now I know why it was such a bargain.

It works ok for notetaking in Google Docs while at conferences, but don't download Chrome: no room for it, and make sure you only have one or two tabs open while on the internet. Absolutely NO functionality for video streaming, which I can live without.

I do like that it's a lightweight device and travels well, but am very disappointed that the most basic of needs cannot be met (ex., operating system). I basically feel ripped off, like the plan was to simply unload them on unsuspecting customers.",
So my daughter used my account to buy this computer and it came with dents and a cracked screen! My daughter tried to contact the email on the card it came with to no avail. It would say that the email doesn't exist. The crack goes from the top left to the middle right and bottom left.  (you can see the crack in the pic),
"i tried to love this tablet, i really did. i tried to give it a chance even though i knew it was cheaply priced and probably wouldn't meet my expectations. well at first it was really great as most electronics are, started up and ran quickly and smoothly. i read through the reviews before i bought it and people were complaining about immediately having to update the os and didn't have enough storage space, so i thought i was pretty clever when i bought a larger micro sd card (128gb). unfortunately it seems that the card space was only good for one update. there have been about two more major updates since the first one and i haven't been able to get my os up to current. it runs super slow now, and don't even think of trying to run multiple programs at once! if you're looking for a reliable laptop to do real work on, spend the extra money and buy a real laptop! this is only good for very small and simple tasks handled one at a time.",
"Just started using the Tp200sa-uhbf Signature edition 2 in 1 and so far everything seems to be working fine.  I wasn't expecting an amazing system, just something that I could use to type documents and surf the web and this is fully capable of handling those two tasks.  I was a little worried about the space on the system but after installing Windows updates there is still 17.5 GB remaining on the hard drive.  Not enough to install any major programs, but enough to store a few documents.  I got a micro SD card for extra space in case I need it in the future.  My product did not come with Office 365.  The seller (Glorious Days) offered me a $20 refund, but wouldn't supply the code.  I'm not sure if this was just an accident or if the computer no longer comes with Office, but be wary of this if Office is a selling point for you.

My biggest complaint with this tablet so far is the wifi reception.  There are places that I can get a decent wifi signal on my phone, my old laptop, and even a Nook but not with this tablet.  Be warned that if your planning to use this tablet in an area where other products only get a few bars then you might only get an intermittent signal or none at all.",
"This budget netbook has a decent screen, a decent keyboard, and is tolerable on speed and storage for the minimalist who uses it for browsing, writing and small tasks.  I bought it for the battery life, screen clarity and keyboard, because I use it mostly for writing and online browsing.

The first one I received had a defective left external speaker, but Amazon returned it without cost to me (except the time to clear the netbook storage and drop off at UPS).  The second one I ordered worked.

Windows 10 will eat up a lot of storage if you don't bridle it.  I turned off updates after the initial update at first login.  I eliminated the Office install (and did my own), the extra Metro apps, and used Powershell (administrator -- stop-service wuauserv type commands) to eliminate bulk.  I'm left with about 14.5GB of internal storage before adding my own apps/programs.  This is not much.  You can install programs to the microSD card (it takes a 128GB no problem), but it is much slower to load.

The speakers are acceptable, but for me not an issue.  Use headphones or a Bluetooth set of speakers if you want quality.

For the money, this is a good investment if you have a specific reason to get a minimalist netbook with the battery and screen it brings.",
"I love this computer so far!  I bought it for going to class and taking to the library.  I have a larger computer, but it was getting heavy lugging it around campus.
Pros:
It is super lightweight and has a small footprint.  Since it is smaller, it fits easily in my backpack and even in some of my purses and in my tote purse.  I also just traveled and it was great for on the plane.  The battery lasts all day, which is perfect if you are running around a lot and not always near an outlet.  Since it is so small, it does not take up much space on my desks, tables in the library, and is great when you have class in a lecture hall with the super small fold up ""desks"".  It is also easy to hold in my lap.

Cons:
There are very few.  Sometimes, it can get bogged down because it doesn't have a lot of RAM.  There is not much on board memory, but I use Google Drive for my files, so that is not a big deal.  I also just keep a micro SD inserted for if I need to save anything on there. What really annoyed me at first was since it has such a less popular charging cord, it took me a while to find one that I was confident would work.

Overall, I love this computer.  I use it in all the various modes because it can be easier when I am on the plane, in the car, or in class.  It is perfect if you want something light weight and portable, mostly for internet or streaming videos.",
"basically terrible.  the operating system takes up most of the 32 GB space on the computer.  I thought the micro SD card would help, but the operating system can't be moved to the SD card.  Also, Windows keeps doing updates that you can't disable, so the operating system takes up more and more unnecessary space.  The result is a laggy computer which takes a long time to load basic websites.  The touchscreen almost doesn't matter because the websites don't even display correctly.  I was trying to save some money by getting a basic computer, and the other reviews said this computer is decent and will function well.  It does not.",
"This computer was about what was expected for the money. I purchased it as a Warehouse Deal and expected some scuffs here and there, but there were no cosmetic issues. That's a win in my book.

After some use, however, I did have issues with some of the drivers. ASUS support was not helpful (nothing to do with Amazon) and I couldn't return the computer as I'd gone out of the return window. Some thorough researching on the internet helped me resolve the issue and I've had no issues with it since then.

I gave this 3 stars because I liked it more than the Surface from Microsoft but I found that this wasn't as useful as I thought it would be in terms of removing my need for my desktop computer or my tablet. It's got OK speed and the battery life is alright but I probably wouldn't leave home without the charger. In hindsight, I might've liked this more had I bought it new.",
"Note - I just received my computer today, so I plan to come back and edit this review once I have used it more!

Beautiful packaging and easy to open. The laptop looks sleek and modern, with a solid, quality heft that belies the ultra-thin profile. The charging cable/plug is nice and compact, but a little disappointing to me - the 2""x2""x1"" plug with only two prongs will easily slip out of my older outlets at the slightest bump. Not to worry, though - so far the battery life is amazing! Right now it's at 68% after using it on and off a lot of the day, and it still says I have 8+ hours left (assuming if I continue my ""light browsing"" use).

Windows 10 is already installed, and took of precisely 11GB of the 28ish actually available. I will be trying out some additional programs and using it more once I receive the 128GB MicroSD card I ordered to supplement the eMMC drive, but for now, I just deleted a few apps I know I won't use (since this is the Signature Edition there isn't much bloatware) and installed my preferred browser, Google Chrome. One issue I discovered with Chrome is that the touchscreen won't work while the keyboard/touchpad are enabled (aka when you're using it as a normal laptop). Apparently this is happening on most Windows 10 laptops with touchscreens and Chrome. After a quick search for help, I went to Chrome Flags, scrolled down to the Enable Touch Events, and changed it from Automatic to Enable. Works perfectly now.

My particular Flip came with a free year of Office 365 Personal, which wasn't mentioned in this listing but was in others, so it was nice to see it included.

Other than fixing the problem with Chrome and touchscreen, I've only had one major issue with using the Flip, and that's with the transition from laptop mode to tablet mode. I'm not talking about the physical movement of the hinge - that flows as smooth as butter - but the computer switching to a more tablet-friendly version of Windows when in tablet (or tent or display) mode. If you're only going to use one or the other this entire session, it's okay. But woe to the person who decides to switch from one to the other mid-task! Whatever window you were using in desktop mode disappears in tablet mode - instead you get the hated Windows 8-like app drawer and now have to hunt for your program again (and good luck counting on it taking you back to where you were). Watching a video in full screen and then changing to tablet mode left the video playing, but slightly offset from the rest of the screen (perhaps due to the notification popping up about the switch?). When I left full screen to see if hitting full screen again would recalibrate the size, I was greeted by the menu and no way back to my video, which blithely continued to play in the background. Reopening Chrome did not work, just opened a new window with no way back to my previous window. I went back to desktop - the window was still missing. Finally put the laptop to sleep, woke it up, and the audio of my video resumed playing, still with no window in sight. At last I started the task manager, which somehow triggered the Chrome window with the video to show up in my taskbar again.

With the ease of switching from laptop to tablet physically, I know I will be doing so mid-task quite often. My solution was to remain in desktop mode even when using the device as a tablet. I will see how this works going forward. I did make sure to leave the virtual keyboard button in the taskbar, so I can summon it when using as a tablet (though I found clicking several times in a text entry field will usually do the same trick).

The 1366x768 resolution isn't the clearest, but for a screen this small it works well (larger would generate smaller icons and text, and since they're fairly small already, a lot of workaround zoom/enlarge functions would be needed for ease of use). I haven't encountered any lag so far. The touchpad will take some getting used to (scroll is more sensitive, tapping less sensitive than my other laptop). The exterior top is a fingerprint magnet, which does take away some of the beauty of the brushed metal design. The interior isn't as bad, though they definitely show on the touchpad. Keys are small, but nice to type on, with a solid thunk as you press them. As one of my main reasons for selling my tablet and getting this was the ability to do more writing on a more portable device, I think it will work well.

Due to the limited storage, I don't know that this will completely replace my laptop, but I fully expect to use the Flip at least 75% of the time, and could definitely see using it for a month or more on its own if I was between other computers. However I don't use much software beyond Chrome and Office (though I want to use Scrivener and GIMP more, as well as several browser-based applications, and I will test their performance on here), so I don't need a workhorse.

I don't intend to use this for games, which is why I didn't choose an Android tablet. I will use the keyboard to type or as a stand most of the time, so I didn't choose something with a detachable keyboard. I wanted something that would run cool and boot fast, so I didn't chose a laptop with a conventional hard drive. I could have used something with more space, but with the way technology advances, I figured I would be replacing whatever I bought in a couple of years anyway - why not see if 32GB works since the price is right while I have another working laptop? I wanted a device for writing, browsing, going seamlessly between the two as I research, creating blog posts, editing spreadsheets, and watching TV shows. I think the Asus Transformer Flip will work perfectly for my needs.",
"This is a great little laptop with tablet capabilities, all with Windows 10. I received a free year of Office 365 with this purchase, as was advertised. As with most 2-in-1s, the keyboard flips around to the back, which turns on the tablet mode. The keyboard keys and touchpad are automatically disabled, so there's no fear of pressing buttons while holding the device in tablet mode.

At this price point, the device works great.The processor is a bit lackluster, so multitasking like you might do on a full laptop might slow you down. But light tasks such as single tab web surfing or using an Office product work fantastically. Don't try to compare this laptop/tablet to a Microsoft Surface or an iPad, as it won't hold up. However, for the price point, this is a great supplemental device that I can easily take with me to work or classes without lugging around my 17"" laptop.

Pros:

Price!
ASUS always has great quality built products. Light weight, but not flimsy.
Keyboard has very satisfying presses, again it doesn't feel flimsy.
Charge life exceeds my expectations. Light to medium use will last a couple of days before needing to charge.
Switches to tablet mode seamlessly.
Supports micro SD card up to 128 GB.

Cons:

Though touch supports multi-gesture, it is overall not as responsive as much more expensive devices.
Screen and touchpad are fingerprint magnets, even after only a few hours of ownership.
Not great at multitasking.
Tiny on board storage of only 32 GB, which includes the OS install. Definitely take advantage of the SD card slot.

*Note: This laptop didn't include the Windows 10 Anniversary Update. If you try to use the update tool from the website, it will fail siting that you don't have enough space, even if you have an SD card installed. THERE IS A WORKAROUND! Download the Windows 10 Media Creation Tool. Run the tool and select ""Upgrade This PC"". It will work, but it might take a few hours. It will still save any documents you may have already saved.",
"I really wanted to like this laptop/tablet, but the fact that I have put it away speaks volumes.  I thought the battery life was fine and I did not have the issues with the charger that some other reviewers had.  You are not going to do anything intensive with this system.  I used it when I was on the go and needed something larger than my phone for general browsing, sending an email or document processing.  The wi-fi and bluetooth worked well as I never had an issue connecting to any internet source or pairing it with my phone in a hotspot situation.

The main issue is the hard drive.  The specs state that it is a 32GB drive, but the usable space is less than 10 after the operating system.  Windows 10 is going to drive you crazy with updates, even if you try to turn off the ""Auto"" function.
 There just isn't enough space to install them.  And it makes using the laptop infuriating.  If you try to install any piece of software, you are done.  You cannot install Office or any of its components.  You can try using an online version of Word or Excel, but you don't have any storage capacity.  You can forget pictures and video.  I ended up using a WD Passport as an external drive connected via a short USB cable for local storage and Dropbox for online storage.

The price is great, but I just recently went shopping for laptops and tablets and found several that are in the $300-500 range that have larger hard drives, more memory and are upgrade-able if you choose to buy a different component.  In the end, I wouldn't buy it again and I hate that I have lost $250.",
"I've owned tons of computers and I was looking for something with a slightly bigger screen that I could use when I travel.  I had previously used an Acer switch 10 that I bought refurbished on Ebay.  This unit shipped with WIndows 8 and after setting up the computer it soon prompted me to update to Windows 10.  I did the update, but soon noticed that it was extremely slow.  I found that after the update it used almost the entire C:\ drive.  It wasn't until I removed the old win8 files that it had about 10gb of space remaining.

As a daily user when I travel, this computer is SLOW.  It was supposed to have a better processor than the acer (atom Z3735F vs celeron N3050), but it is definitely much slower in daily tasks.  Opening more than 3-4 windows in Chrome brings it to a standstill.  This computer is going in the trash pile of computers I have around my house.  My older acer is much faster and I will go back to it for another 6 months.",
"UPDATE 2: It's been nearly 9 months. This will most likely be my last review.
UPDATE: It's been nearly 4 months, so I added an update at the bottom of this review.
=====
There are a number of good reviews on this gem of a device, so I won't recount some of the broadly agreed upon features in detail. I will touch on some tweaks and gems that might make it a little more usable for you.

Summary (remember, this is value/effectiveness compared to price and device class):
++ Excellent battery life - consistenly pushes 8 hours on one charge
++ Very good audio
+ Good display/video (remember that this is based on devices of this class/price)
+ Good input (keyboard is comfortable size for these ham-hands with pleasant tactile response; touch pad functions well)
+ Good speed (remember that this is based on devices of this class/price)
+ Plays Well with Other Devices (Bluetooth and HDMI connection works flawlessly from what I can see; connecting to other systems via internet connection has been spotty for me though it may be my TV but - haven't experimented enough to be sure)
+ Runs programs pretty well (have only tried a couple of light/older games which were not terribly intensive, and did not do a lot of play-testing other than to verify that they loaded and ran). Most importantly, I was able to import (install) MS Office 2010 which runs flawlessly as long as you have a legit license - hey, it's a great version of Office.
- Highly proprietary charging adapter: lucky the power time is so long because you probably don't have to move it (which is when we typically lose or damage our chargers)

In short, everything that you'd like to see in a budget laptop with the added bonus of transforming to a tablet. The ""transforming"" features work rather well with keyboard/touchpad deactivated past 180 degrees (making it an interestingly useful device to use on your lap up against your steering wheel while in a car waiting or resting, a touch tablet with its own stand, or fully folded as a tablet) and option to enter tablet mode (instead of being forced into it, though you can set a default). As pointed out before, it can be awkward when attempting to use as a tablet - most 10+ inch devices can (my personal fave is the 8"" or a little larger than a paper back book).

Here are some things I noticed that may be useful to know, some common to Windows 10, maybe others common just to this tablet:

+ The power level of a Win 10 device with a 2GB RAM processor running sub 2GHz speeds is optimal for browsing, light gaming and the like. If you're a serious gamer who can afford to play all those great games, you're not running it off a tablet in any case. But if you're generating correspondence, checking emails and calendars, making spreadsheets and presentations, and playing Mah-Jong , then this is THE gadget for you.
+ The actual physical buttons for power and volume were so responsive that I didn't realize I had pressed it when trying to turn it on. It takes very little pressure to use them and the lack of tactile feedback can be disconcerting.
+ HDMI output works flawlessly - true plug and play. No glitches using the Project feature (duplicate screen, monitor only, computer only, extend for dual screen).
+ Google Chrome worked with no problems. I note that here because I've purchased a Win 10 tablet that required a bit of effort to make it work.
- Forget using your External DVD reader to load programs from disk: that's a chore... I'm not sure if it was my external DVD drive or just something in the whole schema of things, but it was way too slow. I got a drive clone program and mount a virtual disk - which worked exceptionally well for me.
- If you plan on using Google Drive, make sure you have a microSD card (formatted to NTFS file format) of 32+ GB, create an appropriate folder on that drive and carefully go through Drive's set up routine and choose that folder as your Drive files storage. If you try to save your files to a microSD card formatted on anything other than NTFS, Google Drive will politely reject you (without explaining why).

9/30/16 UPDATE
4 months later and I will soon get another of the same model to replace this thing, but let me explain why:
+++ Physical Durability: THIS LAP-TAB IS TOUGH!!! I have dropped it more than my cell phone, I've literally tossed it 8 feet across a room (accidentally - it was sitting on a nearby surface during an Italian Table Flip Incident) and it finally took significant damage while I was on a train where it was accidentally knocked over and the screen developed numerous fractures... and STILL works. I did have to figure out how to disable the touch feature as the fracture pressures were causing multiple ""finger presses"" but it's been 4 weeks and this thing still works GREAT! I'm trying to be a little more cautious with it, so I did by a generic 11.6"" screen protector to keep the damage from spreading, and I've had no issues with display or function.
- Internal Storage Creep and Windows Updates: Though I'm reasonably careful to use my 64GB MicroSD card, even using to install my programs to where possible, I've still accumulated some data on my internal storage, so I'm under 1GB - which is not enough space for me to get this latest Windows Update. Yes, in the past I've cleared out my previous Windows Updates but I'll try it again and hopefully I can avoid clearing out actual programs. NOTE: Here's a very useful link for cleaning up space on Win10 Systems: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17421/windows-free-up-drive-space . Just went there, and may have found one of my problems in my WindowsSxS (Windows Store) folder.

2/12/17 UPDATE
I continue to use this as my go to on the go Lap-Tab. I'm very content with it. My only desire would be this exact same product in a 4GB RAM version.
+ The battery life has not significantly declined.
+ After finally figuring out how to get it working, a Windows 10 update now allows me to save updates directly to the flash drive, though it would like for you to have 14 GB available. Still a win, though.
+ I've been able to find a replacement power supply here on Amazon.
+/- Connecting to my TV via internet connection has become consistent. I was mistakenly attempting to use the Project feature when I should have been using the Connect feature. It often rejects my first connection attempt but picks up successfully on my second attempt. It gives off a occasional clicking sound when it should be giving a system notification sound, and there is a slight cursor lag which worsens if your internet connection is poor. Still useful enough for display purposes but may get frustrating if you're writing a paper.
- The micro HDMI output port has become loose because of my regular use of it and the fact that it is a micro port which means the amount of connection surface area is low, ergo the weight of the cord alone is enough to put pressure on the port and loosen it. It still works well, but I am careful with it.

"Love Samsung across the board. From our 75"" smart Samsung TV to the I sure little gem if a tablet.

First up. The tablet was lose in the box. I want to like it but it isn't what i like. The screen is not touch worthy. It is too quirky. It also shows signs of wear but you would think paying $109.00 for an item i should be able to enjoy my purchase. I don't got money for this.,
Purchase 2 of these laptops. One works great and the other 1 works terrible. I would say 5050 chance on quality is not a very impressive percentage.,

"First off, I know Dell computers extremely well because I use them exclusively at work and frequently have to troubleshoot and repair them for my job. That's why I chose to buy a refurbished Dell -- even if it's got problems I know how to fix them. However, even after using every troubleshooting effort known using different monitors, cables, Dell docks etc. I still have no video output from the USB C thunderbolt ports nor the dedicated HDMI port. I have tried every driver old and new, updated all possible updates, did all the YouTube and Dell troubleshooting tips, even upgraded to windows 11 pro and downgraded again.  After finally doing a factory reset with no results I give up. Everything else seems to work fine, and the case is minorly beat up.

Laptop with external monitor capability is useless to me. Returned.

***UPDATE*** I'm adding two stars back because the customer service was prompt to handle the issue and process the return.",
Was supposed to be fully tested but right out of the box the keys on the top left of the keypad were sticking.  Have to press several times to get them to work.  Guess the original owner spilled something on the keyboard and now the contacts under the keys needs cleaning.  New keyboard is over $100.  Other than this issue the computer looks good and works great.,
"I don't know if mine is touch screen ... But it's a great little laptop and the cost of it couldn't have been better. There is like no memory to it so I had to buy 2T box to go with it, that was  like $60. Overall I feel like it was a good buy.",
"The Seller was completely unresponsive to the fact that the unit was shipped damaged.  They indicated the unit shipped was a ""factory sealed HP Stream Laptop PC"" on Mar 8, 2022.  This statement alone indicated that they did not inspect the unit Monitor (Screen) which could not reflect any damage unless the unit was powered on in some fashion.  Upon powering the unit and the installation process began, the defect was easily visible on the bottom-middle portion of the screen.

Now I find myself wanting one of my own because it's so lightweight & convenient. If you read the specs & know what you're getting you will not be disappointed.",
I bought this product to be able to do school work whether I am on break at work or sitting outside in the backyard watching my daughter play. It does exactly what I need it to do. I dont think it would be great for gaming or anything extensive but if you need a lightweight laptop to connect to wifi to do school work it works perfectly!,
It is so low storage that it can barely load more than one tab at a time and often randomly closes out of what im doing. Not efficieng for writing papers or doing anything serious. Shouldve spent more on a higher quality product!,
"Why the heck did you sell me this computer with a Windows 10 system that turns obsolete soon due to no more updates or support!  I have nothing stored on it - no pictures, no documents, no music, yet the updater says there's no space for updates now.  I just bought it for streaming, Facebook, and internet surfing - $167 down the tube.

UPDATE ON NOVEMBER 25, 2020:  Furthermore, I have trouble streaming stuff to my computer every stinking day.  I use livenewsnow.com to get my news.  Sometimes, it works, but then I come in here the next day, and there's either no video, audio, or both - every single day  this happens.  This computer is the worst piece of crap I've ever owned, and I've been on the internet for 21 yeas, so I'm no greenhorn.",
"I consider myself a little computer savy and I cant access Microsoft Office. It is asking for a product key I never received.
Other than, I love it.",
"I have both a Chromebook and a Kindle, wanted something between those, and this is perfect--- it let me turn my regular Windows 10 laptop  ( a little too large for my liking) over to my husband, whose laptop on the way out.
Now we are both happy.
Shipping from amazon was great, even if customs in Guadalajara( we live in Mexico) was its usual bother for DHL",
"My daughter received this as a Christmas present. She needed her own laptop for school work. And she loves it. Easy to surf the web, check her emails and do school assignments. The only thing was that we had difficulty with Microsoft 10 not letting us download  Chrome. It took a lot of time to figure it out.  Other than that it's a great laptop for a first time user.",
Beautiful it works awesomely well and have not had any problems with this purchase or the product whatsoever. It was very reasonable in price and its been very reliable as well . And that's good for me because im a college student so I needed a good lightweight laptop like this to type my papers up. Its also really fast which is good. Period,
"If you are a real techie, you wouldn't touch this thing.  If you're not you will either have to learn a lot to salvage 10-12 GB of usable memory or be constantly fighting with it.  Bought for my wife so she didn't ruin her eyes staring at her phone but my bad.  Didn't get around to paying heed to her problems until it was out of warranty.

Subject: Re: Updating Windows 10 OS on an HP Stream with 32 GB eMMC memory

Yes these ""Cloudbooks"" were pushed out by Microsoft to compete with Chromebooks. Laptop OEMs were enticed to offer these by subsidies and virtually free OS license. In retrospect these things were the Edsel of the laptop industry.",
"I vowed never to buy another HP product, but I regrettably broke that promise. I figured for the price, how could I go wrong? We bought two of these and right away the space bar started acting up on both of them. Half the time, the space bar doesn't work, and now, the ""g"" key doesn't always work on the one I use. The hard drive is so small that it can't even do a Windows update. The latest problem on the one I use is now the internet is super slow(on just this one). That was the last straw for me and that's why I'm here posting this review. I don't usually bother, but I don't want anyone else wasting their money. I'mjust sorryI couldn't give it zero stars. Notice therewere no spaces in the last two sentences. I got tired of going back and retyping.",
"The hardware is great for the size of the laptop, it can handle small workloads  but its nice for on the go. its lightweight and amazingly portable and the gaming aspect of this device for anyone that is wondering is not the best, i was able to run 3 windows of diablo 2 and that was it before my laptops processor and video card occupancy capped out",
This was a good purchase for me. It is lightweight and has the Microsoft office applications already installed.  The computer only works in S mode for safety.,
"Look ....
It's 160 bucks.  lol  For that price, what are you expecting, Core i7-level performance ...?
It's great for surfing, YouTube & DOSBox gaming [where games are better, anyway].
My $2000+, barely a year old ""MacBook"" just pooped the bed.  FOR NO REASON.
First I started laughing.
Then I started crying.
Then I bought this.
And I couldn't be happier, and I think you will be, too!",
I had this laptop for 5 weeks and windows 10 can’t update because there is not enough disk space.  All my husband does on this laptop is Facebook and email!  I got what I paid for ....  It was one week past allowable return time.,
"I AM VERY SAD. I have been so excited all week waiting for this computer to arrive. I opened it tonight and was pleased to see that it was very nicely packaged in its original HP box. I charged it up, turned it on, and OH NOOOO THERE IS A BIG DEAD SPOT ON THE SCREEN!! I bought this item for the sole purpose of using it for digital art. I can not use it if there's a big ol' patch of dead pixels in the way. I'm returning it and will buy a different laptop from a different vendor. So disappointing. I do not recommend.",
I was expecting a larger screen but that’s my bad. The laptop works great. I’m in online school and it works great for that. The battery life is great. I don’t charge it every night and it’s still got a full battery. I do shut it down when not in use though. It’s extremely light and fits in my purse which is a plus. Great value for the money I spent.,
We LOVED this tiny affordable computer until in less than 3 months it stopped connecting to the internet for no reason.  Working with customer service is very hard.  They talked me in to a payment plan that cost more than the computer (but gives service to ALL my computers for 1 year).  Then when I got thru to them (after many hours of round and round) it was determined it couldn't be fixed and we had to send the computer back to HP to be replaced.  We haven't gotten them replacement computer back yet.  (VERY happy they agreed to replace it!!! ),
"Don't waste your money this laptop is just too small the screen.
Save a bit and buy something bigger. Except Lenovo Laptops.
They Suck!!!!!",
"I just need to know how to take advantage or download 365 Office to the computer. I want to use Microsoft Word, other then that the computer is great!",
"I have used Chrome in my ThinkCentre desktop and other laptops.  Trying to set up the HP Stream just like the ThinkCentre, but the Stream doesn't want to take it.",
The Stream is a cute small portable computer. The office that comes with the computer last maybe a week. If you have larger hands DO NOT BUY! The keyboard will be hard to use,
"UPDATE: I’ve had the laptop for 4 months and my hard drive crashed. I don’t even do anything crazy with this computer just Microsoft word and internet. I took it to a diagnoses person when I suddenly couldn’t connect to WiFi and he said the driver was gone and further stated the hard drive was trash. He said the laptop isn’t even fixable. I contacted the seller which was a hassle in itself with amazon and will update with what they say.

Original review:
I LOVE this laptop. It was perfect for what I needed it for. Super easy and compact for easy transporting to and from locations. Also the battery lasts DAYS. Everyone’s plugging in during class and I can have this open without needing a power source. It’s great if you need something simple. All I do is use Word, power point and chrome. I opted out of Windows S mode and downloaded Chrome and it works just fine.",
"Storage issues like severe issues with storage. Although I got an external memory the laptop still sends things to the pc, even though I clear/clean the laptop can’t update causing it to be MEGA SLOW

annoying asf",
The one thing I don’t like is it’s hard drive space... 32gb(in reality it has 27.6) is taken up mostly already by its basic programs. You can’t hold your pictures on it when you need to download a 5.7gb update. I have to use an external hard drive to finish the windows update...,
I purchased this for my son for Christmas in 2019. Since he has had it (not even 8 months) it has locked up on him to where it wouldn’t recognized when the mouse was used. I had to restore it to factory settings in order to get it to work. And now (for about a month and a half actually) it will not connect to WiFi. Doesn’t even show any WiFi networks. Did a search it. Said to go to settings and click on WiFi to ensure it was on. No WiFi option. So did yer another restore to factory settings. And guess what. Still doesn’t work. Still doesn’t show any networks. Still doesn’t show a WiFi option. So now with my son having this laptop for less then 8 months. And maybe getting to use it for 6 I have to spend money on yet another laptop because he has to have it for virtual learning.,
"Bought this as a Christmas gift. Only last until the Summer! Even though it was well taken care of, one day I turned it off and it wouldn't turn back on! The warranty ran out way to quickly for such a device. Trouble shooting suggest taking the battery out, but there is NO EASY way of doing that!!",
Love my laptop! It was easy to set up and super lightweight (which I didn’t expect). The only thing down about this computer is I can’t google chrome on it for some reason.,
"Simple little laptop. Won't wow or amaze you, bought it for my wife and son to browse the internet. Took it out of ""S"" mode as soon as I bought it. Nice lite laptop.",
"Great lightweight laptop, used it for streaming movies,music. Speakers are loud enough. and browsing internet, no need for apps when you can pin bookmarks links to desktop. But windows still has apps to use.",
"The product was good and delivered on time. It iwas what I expected except from some print on the cover like where someone touched it when packaging. Lightweight, small like I wanted.",
"Couldn’t even get this to run. Correction, it ran through the set up but I wasn’t able to use the Internet. I could search on google but couldn’t access any websites. Possibly because of windows 10. Not sure. Yes, I shut everything down and rebooted. All my other devices were able to connect to WiFi.  HP support was AWFUL! They kept telling me nothing was wrong with the laptop.  I told them couldn’t get online to turbo tax and rep at HP said “well I am able to get on the website so you should be able to get on the website.” Dumbest thing I ever heard, he’s on an entirely different computer. Needless to say, after 90 minutes on the phone with HP, they were not able to solve the issue or getting the laptop to work so I returned it. Very frustrating experience. Amazon allowed me to return with no hassle. In fact, UPS came to my door with the return label.",
"Perfect laptop for someone in school.  The free Microsoft office for a year is a great added bonus. The only drawback is, I'm having a lot of trouble downloading Google chrome.",
"Most important thing: this is the most cooperative keyboard that I have ever used and I have used computers since the 1980's. Typing on this is wonderful. Setup was a little difficult because I already had a Microsoft Office subscription on my other two computers, so I had choices to make. Setting up Outlook with our e-mail required the help of the tech at our internet server. All in all, this did not take too much time. We purchased this computer to use when we travel, but I am finding it very enjoyable right now, sitting at my kitchen table. For the price this was an excellent purchase for us. UPDATE: THE ""WONDERFUL"" KEYBOARD DIED ABOUT TWO MONTHS AGO. I FINALLY TOOK IT TO THE REPAIR SHOP AND IT CAN BE FIXED FOR JUST ABOUT WHAT I PAID FOR THE COMPUTER, BECAUSE THERE ARE NO PARTS AVAILABLE, AND A NEW COMPATIBLE KEYBOARD WOULD HAVE TO BE FOUND. WARRANTY AND SUPPORT HAVE EXPIRED. SO THIS WAS ACTUALLY A VERY BAD PURCHASE FOR US.",
I love this little laptop. It is the perfect fit for school work. The battery life is pretty impressive. It can get sluggish with lots of programs running. Its lightweight and the start up is speedy. A good buy.,
"I bought this laptop a while back and finally got the chance to use it for a decent amount of time. I don't think I like it. It is surprisingly slow and the space bar might be the hardest space bar to press I've ever come in contact with. The pre installed software takes up so muchspace, I can't even install updates. The battery life is ok. I bought a 14"" Asus Chromebook that was perfect. If I wasn't so anti google, I probably would've bought that again. Anyway, I tried this bad boy out for you and it's more hassle then it's worth imo. Just spend 50 bucks more and get an adult size laptop with more storage space.",
"I've had this laptop for almost a year and a half, and wish I had spent the money on something decent. I'm constanstly, CONSTANTLY, receiving notices to free up storage, and that it's unable to istall the latest updates. The problem is, it's all the system programs taking up the storage, so there's not way to free up more than a couple of megabytes of space. I've moved everything personal to a USB drive, but even that doesn't help. I'm sick of this, so I'll be buying something better soon, but it will NOT be an HP. Even Samsung is better than this crap. Take my advice, and stay away from this, unless you do absolutely nothing but get online. Even then, you'll still get the notices about not being able to install updates, so be prepared to be annoyed by that daily. Anybody have a steamroller I can borrow for an hour or two?

Giving 1 star because I'm forced to, not because it deserves even that much.",
"When I first signed in, there was a mix up in the initial start up requesting an unknown address. I had to clear up the problem by calling HP support. Now I am unable to sign in to the network and Office 365. The instructions included are incomplete. If I cannot resolve the present problems of signing in I am ready to return the laptop.",
"I kind of like this computer [despite how flimsy it is ... NEVER drop it] but the problem that keeps arising is disk space. I got the machine to write as I travel and therefore have not saved large files or software on it. HOWEVER of the 27.8 G available I seem to be always confronted with having less than 1G free space. After a long VERY upsetting conversation with HP customer service it seems that this machine is known by them to loose disk space to updates. To fix this they want you to subscribe and pay to recover space or buy more disk space. I am very upset and if I could return this I would. I DO NOT recommend that you buy this computer and that you choose a much more reliable machine that you will not have to pay to use much less find yourself in a position  where you cannot store anymore content including a simple text document. ALSO to reiterate the customer service experience was HORRIBLE.
PS: TOUCH SCREEN?????????",
"I've had this laptop for about six months.  I didn't need anything fancy, just something to access the internet and do some word documents on occasionally.  This fit the bill...until now.  I've been trying for over a week to install the latest Windows 10 update and it keeps failing because it says there's not enough storage and to free up space.  THERE IS NOTHING on this computer other than what came preinstalled by HP and I can't remove any of it.  There is NOTHING in documents, in downloads, in the recycle bin, in pictures,  or music.  I've run the troubleshooter, defragmented, optimized and deleted, uninstalled everything I possibly could and I still don't have enough storage space.  And, every time I check to see what storage I have, I have even less than I did previously.  HP tech support couldn't help me but would be happy to transfer me to software support for a fee.  No thanks...I'll save my money and buy something else.",
"Nice little computer for the price. I mostly use for light word processing and email.  There’s nothing wrong with the touch pad (I’ve never used the touch screen) but find it’s easier to use with a wireless mouse. The small storage is really small, but has been easy to work around. I uninstalled all the pre-installed programs and apps I won’t use and didn’t need.  Additionally, I keep all my documents and saved down loads on a usb drive.",
"I had a very disapointing end to this laptop. I loved this little laptop, I had taken it out of S mode and enjoyed it for 8 months! My little sidekick laptop, I did everything with it. When I started school, man-o-man this laptop was my everything. One week into my summer brake and it just stopped connecting to the internet. I tried and tried to fix the issue, contacted tech support, watched videos on how to resolve the issue with no luck. turns out the warranty had expired the day before I ordered it, Not only that but, it had been discontinued also. sad sad day for me. I feel like I lost a little piece of me.",
Ordered this for my son so he could do his school work online. Very easy to set up and use. He seems to really like it and we have not had any issues as of yet.,
Bought this to replace my very aged MacBook as something to just watch YouTube or Netflix on and it’s great for that with its long battery life I’d have to take it out of S Mode but it was easy enough to do,
"I just bought it and just turned it on. So I may change this review later on. But for now, unlike an Asus or a Leveno laptop, it connected to my home's open wifi right away. And stay connected as well too. It was like wow third time is the charm here. But for now I am super happy about it and I don't have to return it either and just give up until I have the money in real life to get a mini laptop.",
"So to start with I wasn't a huge fan of the screen size, I've usually had 15"", so that's not necessarily on them, but more so not something that I was into. The operating system wasn't great, it was pretty slow as well. Didn't fit my needs as hoped so I sent it back. Not a terrible computer, maybe a good starter one, but not my cup of tea.",
"I was excited when I opened the package and saw how compact and lightweight this was. I figured it would be great to take with me to teach classes and workshops. As I tried to go online, I found that pages loaded slowly, many times pictures did not show, and at times it would freeze up on me. I tried sending an Email and it would allow me to put in the address and subject line but would not allow me to write a message. You had to use the Microsoft Edge browser as it would not allow you to download Chrome. I contacted Amazon who connected me with HP; they told me that the computer I owned for two hours ""probably had a corrupted disc or virus"" and then told me it was no longer under warranty and I would have to pay them $49 to have them look at it. I told them I'd rather trash it than pay them to service a brand-new computer. Thankfully, Amazon is allowing me to return it. and I will never again buy a computer from HP.

This review was posted from a working computer, not the junk I bought.",
"Lasted one year, then it blew.  Never again.

Previous Review:

I bought it because I liked the specs, and one of the reviewers said it worked perfectly with Linux.  It comes with Windows 10-S.  The ""S"" stands for ""Satanic"" because it's the Windows way of forcing users to buy their crappy software.

Anyhoo, I tried the Linux demo, but it couldn't find the Wifi card, then I figured, so what?  I'll buy a USB Wifi unit for $15.  So I installed Linux on the whole 32gb HD.  Still no sign of the Wifi.

Next step was to update all of the software, which took 1.5 hours.  After updating the software, the Wifi magically came alive and worked perfectly first try.  An invisible network.

It's not a perfect unit.  There are no pad buttons, so it's kind of squirrelly, but I'll just buy a little portable mouse.

Other than that, it is a noticeably fast little box and it should be great for day trips and road trips and any time I need my laptop and my files and a way to connect to the internet.",
"I'm actually using it right now and it's the perfect size for sitting on the couch doing some homework. My schooling requires me to travel so I bought this so I wouldn't have to lug my 17"" laptop around with me anymore. It comes with the exact features that I need for school and so far having been off the charger for about an hour I've hardly lost any battery. The screen is about the size of a tablet which is perfect for being so portable, it barely weighs anything.",
"This is exactly what I was looking for, a nice small lightweight computer to take with me when I want to do some writing outside of my home.  I just got it so I haven't used it too much yet but so far, it works great.  The screen is small but I can use MS Word and change the font size for easier viewing.  It has two USB ports.  The screen has beautiful crisp color.  Great price from HP.  My home computer is an HP, I love their products.",
"I am VERY disappointed with this computer. We bought this for my daugter, who was starting High School. The compter is now broken after only 8 months of normal use. We bought in November 2019 it is July 2020, i checked the status of the warranty on the HP website to find out it expired in June of 2019. How has a warranty expired on a BRAND NEW COMPUTER before I even bought it? Now there is no warranty with HP or with Amazon because I am past the return and support windows. This is very bad. School starts in 3 weeks, virtually, and my daughter has no Laptop.  This is UNACCEPTABLE to allow a company to sell used items on your platform as new. I will never buy another elctronic item on Amazon. Beware of Scam Sellers",
"i wanted to give zero stars, but this won't let me, so I had to click on one star.  I hate this thing.  I guess the price was too good to be true.  Issues started less than a year into having it.  It keeps wanting to download updates but then says there is no space on the hard drive to download.  I finally decided after 5 months to deal with it and tried to free up space as per the computer prompts.  There was barely anything I could delete!  So then I went out and bought an external hard drive.  Still tells me there isn't enough space on the computer hard drive.  So I move a few things (what the computer allows) to the external drive.  STILL NOT ENOUGH SPACE AND I CAN'T DELETE ANYTHING ELSE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I really only use this computer for Facebook (occasionally),buying off Amazon (occasionally) and writing stories to publish that I save to a flash drive, so not even on the computer hard drive.  HOW CAN I NO HAVE ANY SPACE TO DOWNLOAD UPDATES????!!!!!!  I will never buy another HP again.",
"To be honest, I loved this computer, great for doing school work and more, It runs smoothly on all the apps I use (Roblox, MediBang 32bit, etc.) until one little drop from my desk broke the internet hardware. I was shooked. I have another one coming today, thanks to Amazon they handled the problem. I recommend a case or something for any laptop, I also recommend to buy this.
I’m still going to give it 5 stars since Amazon handled the problem with a solution and of how great this laptop actually is.",
I was trying to get a computer for school. I was super excited and everything seemed good but at the bottom of the screen there were two black splotches that looked like ink spots where the screen was broken. It came fast and everything was great except the screen situation,
"This was a nice lightweight laptop for web surfing and playing solitaire etc. until the wifi adapter quit working less than 2 years after purchase. Ordered a replacement, no driver for it and because the operating system was WIndows 10 S, there are no individual drivers available. HP wants $40 plus shipping for Windows recovery kit for this system, I can see no reason to invest more money in it, off to the landfill :(.",
"Thought I ordered an 14 inch
Instead it was a 11.1
I'm used to working with 15.6 or more
But the fact remains
I love this little laptop until once again I'll have to purchase another
Out of window- S mode
Probally 2 min license switch to windows 10 home
And honestly brought because it installed 4 gig ram
So now I can run my professional software and use at ease
Extremely satisfied
Even that it's connected to any thing Bluetooth or Wi-Fi enabled devices around
Extra Micro SD card will do..
USB hub will be needed if other devicesir controls are needed simultaneously",
"So far it has been a great laptop. I as still learning how to with the Microsoft Windows 10 system, Office 365 and the HP setup. Thank goodness I have a Microsoft Store near. Now to find help to install a printer. I like the size, it’s easy to use and at a great price. The battery life is good.",
"I purchased two of these computers for work. One worked just fine and I have no complaints. The other had a screwy keyboard. Press Y and get a Z. Press Z, get a Y. And all the uppercase number characters were wrong. Checked to make sure the keyboard was set for United States English and everything was correct there. I was on hold with HP support for over an hour. Then the jerks picked up and hung up on me. Sending the one back for full replacement. Thank God I bought this from Amazon. No hassle and fast replacement.",
"Had to return first unit. Space bar would often not register a keystroke. Amazon quickly sent a replacement. Basic computer. Needed something cheap to throw in my backpack or browse online while on the couch and this fit the bill. Wish HP offered a 6gb memory version, 4 is just barely enough to run windows and a few browser tabs. Other than that works great.",
"This laptop operates fine and is a good bang for your buck, but it has almost no excess storage memory.  It comes with lots of extra apps/programs you probably don't want, but that's a Windows 10 problem, not this laptops fault.  However even after uninstalling everything that's optional this laptop is constantly running out of storage space.  The only thing I've downloaded is firefox.  I have to delete temporary files etc... every 30 minutes or so when using it. So don't plan on downloading any programs to this laptop if you want it to function properly.  Just by an HP with more memory.",
"I bought it to present digital artwork at out local art show.  It did a fine job.
It's clearly not the fastest computer you can buy, but for the money . . . How can you go wrong?
It's very light, and the battery seems to hold up well.
It comes with MS Office (though I have a subscription anyway) which works well.
I will maybe load some more demanding applications on it soon.  So far . . . it did a good job and I would recommend it.

Touch  Screen???  I'll have to see if there is something I have to do to configure that.  In any case, I'm fine with the built in, or external mouse.",
"I received my laptop today, on time, and in perfect condition. That’s where the fairytale ends. The computer said that Windows 10 needed to be updated in order to run the iCloud app that I downloaded from the Microsoft Store.  When I tried to update, I got an error message that there was not enough memory. It suggested that I use an external drive to add space. I did everything I was prompted to do, but continued to get the same message. I spent over two hours, adding an external usb drive as instructed. Just before the installation finished each time,  I got the same warning that there’s not enough memory.  Out of 32 gigabytes, less than  one gigabyte was was available. When I started to update, a pop up saying everything was okay and memory was fine. After spending over two hours trying and retrying, canceling S mode, and doing everything I was prompted to do, I give up. The machine is fantastic, and I only wanted to install the iCloud app from the App Store (MS store). I’ll be packing it up tomorrow and sending it back. I use cloud storage, so I thought the 32 gigabytes would at least have enough memory to update the operating system. I love Windows 10, and I love this laptop, but if I can’t update windows, and if I can’t access all my data, then I’ll need to try another machine.",
"This is not a serious work laptop.
Slow and unreliable with a huge battery.
Worst TN pannel I ever saw.
Linux is a must on this laptop.
Windows is way too heavy for 2 cores at 1.1Ghz",
"I really wanted to like this chromebook and I did like that it's light weight and easy to use. Unfortunately it has no storage, and by no storage I mean that it was not able to update the Windows updates even with a 64mb storage card that I added to the laptop. This makes it useless since I had nothing stored on it except the windows program and it couldn't function. I had to return it for a refund. I will not be buying another Chromebook again. I have no idea of how anyone can use this Chromebook since doesn't have sufficient memory for Windows updates but it does come with Windows 10 installed.",
"I've had this computer since May. It was great for what I needed: email and Microsoft office for work. It doesn't have much hard drive space, so I haven't saved anything to it and I haven't downloaded any new programs. I keep all my music, docs, photos, videos on an external hard drive and connect when needed. This was fine until the recent Windows 10 update. The computer doesn't have enough hard drive space to perform it. I even had a Microsoft Help Desk rep remote into my computer to help me find a way to either clean up disk space or use my external drive to perform the update. Do you know what his solution was? He said that my only option would be to go to the manufacturer and BUY MORE RAM. That's right - HP has created a computer that cannot do the most basic of functions: update it's own software. So I went back to the seller: ""iTech365 (We Record S/N)"" -- who has now engaged me in a never-ending string of emails where they don't listen to the actual problem and keep telling me to troubleshoot things that I've already looked at. Stay away from that seller, you guys. Because if, heaven forbid, you have a problem more than 30 days after purchase, you're screwed.

Note, I bought this computer mid-May. Of COURSE I didn't know about the software space issue till 6 months later. There wouldn't have been an update before then.",
For general operations this is a great and affordable laptop. The light weight makes for an enjoyable experience as you want may want to lounge around and take it easy. Top outer shell of it however is not so fingerprint friendly but does not decrease the rating drastically. All around this laptop for $160 is a sturdy and reliable laptop and across the board is worthy of a decent rating from 4.0 to 4.5,
"I purchased this laptop in October 2019. It is now the end of March 2020. Less than six months of owning this thing, and I have hardly used it. I only use it for web-based paperwork for working from home, and only for an average of about 2 hours a week (probably less than that, but I'm being generous here).

Yesterday my wireless adapter component or whatever it's called completely died yesterday. There's no way to connect to the internet without that. Thankfully an IT guy I work with looked at it for me, and was able to give me a USB wireless adaptor to use so that I can still use it for work. He told me it has some hardware going bad already, and I might be able to squeeze another year out of it.

For the short amount of time and few hours of use this computer has seen, that is ridiculous. And stupid me, I didn't buy a warranty.

Also, it has such a small hard drive it doesn't have enough disk space to update Windows 10. It's a nice little computer, but it has some major issues. Very frustrating!",
"The very limited onboard storage. Apps and programs fill this allocated space quickly even for an average person. Data needs be stored offline in the cloud or a ""WD Passport"". The speed and functionality otherwise are great. portability exceptional even for an already sturdy small footprint device. I use with some heavy duty math (electromagnetics) and VoIP programs, at home, in the car, and away. I am impressed even with the mass storage severe limitations.",
It's not worth it at all. I would buy a cheap thinkpad on Amazon or Ebay. It's just not worth it.,
"As is, the hardware is a decent value for the price (good battery life and keyboard, decent build quality, acceptable screen and trackpad) but it's a shame that it is saddled with Windows 10 and mandatory updates that use up the limited storage.
This machine is perfect for a lightweight XFCE or LXQT based linux distro. You will generally get more performance out of the same hardware compared to Windows 10, and you will have more of the 32gb eMMC available for your own programs and files.",
"I guess I got what I paid for with a cheap laptop. First, it was a pain to take if off of Safety Mode so that I could get Google Chrome on the computer. However, once I took it off Safety Mode, it constantly told me it couldn't update because there wasn't enough memory on the computer, even though I had no files saved and even took Google Chrome off to try and solve it. Then, after having it a year and exactly one month after the warranty expired, the WiFi chip stopped working and I couldn't access the internet on it. Geek Squad told me it would cost $80 to fix the chip with them, which is almost half of what I paid for the laptop in the first place. Even before the WiFi chip broke, I had trouble using Zoom. I used to find HP a reliable brand, but frankly this laptop was a disappointment and kind of a waste of money as now it's just a simple word processor unless I'm ready to shell out to fix it. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this model, and I wish I'd gone with something else.",
"Like another recent reviewer, I removed Windows (I rarely use it) and loaded Linux.

Arch Linux, i3 window manager, Chromium browser, MPlayer, some NodeJS apps and more
After the initial disk format/partition, I had 29G of space to install everything. Currently with all the programs and features I want there is still 21G left!
I only had a slight issue installing using EFI as bootloader, but after that was resolved everything else just worked!
Battery: I had this unit on for 5 hours - most of that streaming videos. After 5 hours I still had 33% battery life left.

I am surprised how much I enjoy using this little laptop. Note that the most current specs (Aug 2019) for this does have a USB 3.1 and a USB 2.0. You can look this model up on HP's website for all the specs (11-ah117wm)",
"$160 is all this cost me and it works great for basic productivity applications. With this little guy I'm able to prepare PowerPoint presentations for work, analyze data in Excel, write in Word, smoothly remote to my main workstation via TeamViewer, and browse in Chrome. I'm even able to stream 720p video just fine. I could also run Octave and do some basic image processing (which really surprised me).
You will have to get a micro SD card for storage and a USB mouse to make up for a lackluster touch pad. But overall, this little machine can serve for lightweight use. Also, it has an 8-10 hour battery life which is pretty incredible. And it is fanless, meaning it runs silently. You won't be gaming on this system, but I think it's a great way to bridge the gap between you and your main workstation without spending a lot of money.",
"The laptop was sent out to me within two days of ordering it. It came neatly packaged in all original HP packaging. What really annoyed me is that they advertised that a 1-year free personal subscription to Office 365 is included and when I set-up the product I noticed that it is not pre-loaded. I contacted the seller and they let me know I had to register the product with the manufacturer, and they would send me an activation code. I registered my product and had a two-hour remote-controlled service on my PC with and HP representative; he then let me know that the subscription is not included in the normal sale of the product. Long story short, I do not have access to Office 365, false advertising and very frustrating. Two hours wasted on trying to get something that wasn't included in the first place. Very upset with this.",
"This computer is ok.  You get what you pay for.  If you are only trying to surf the internet and maybe do a little personal business using Microsoft office like I am and can deal with Microsoft Edge all the time then you will love it.  This computer can download chrome, but it is not recommended.  I did not.  I also cannot get it to talk to my phone like it should.  It was bit difficult to import everything from chrome to Microsoft edge but I worked it out.  I tried a chromebook 1st but was not easily able to work offline which is another good thing about this laptop.  And honestly, I think that not having chrome is the worst part about it but then again, it's $200.  I am making it.
Bottom line, it can get the job done for simple task or for a student in high school.",
"I just needed a portable laptop to drag around so I can take online classes. I don't do gaming or have hardly any downloads.
Pro: super lightweight, small size, easy to set up, inexpensive Office 365 included for a year, easy to remove the Microsoft security block.

Cons: after loading the included Office 365 which is a pro, I only have 2 GB of storage left after storing all my documents on the cloud. It wasn't a problem but after 6 months Windows want to update and asked for a minimum of 8 gb of space freed up. I'm not tech savvy at all so this is frustrating.",
"Add a big (low profile) 3.1 USB drive to it and you have a little monster, BUT Windows will not be able to update for very long. MOST apps will not allow you to install them on another drive either, so as long as you like it AS-IS and just looking for something with its stock features, add the extra drive for files (like photos) and you'll be OK. I was really in love with this thing at the start, but it ran out of C drive space and I can't do anything about it. Can't move potions of Windows and it already come running in compressed format so no more solutions. This machine and others like it were A BIG MISTAKE BY THE THE CREATORS, as they could have easily stuck at least a 128 GB memory chip where the 32 sits and it would be an awesome machine! I'd buy another or two! What a waste. Anyway, if you need a machine fast and don;t have the bucks for something immediately, this will open docs and print and get email and everything else, but I'd consider it a temp machine for being in a jam, and not a long term use machine, as you can't update Windows and sooner than later the thing will be a security threat for you. Best if you don't need to take it out of S-Mode. For those who can't use S-mode, I highly suggest you get one with at least a 128 GB chip and add a couple of 256 to the ports.",
"I needed something inexpensive and quick enough to surf the web and create word documents until I can upgrade to something better later. This little computer is perfect for all that. It arrived in perfect condition, set up was simple, and it was up and running before I knew it. My only complaints about it are: 1) the back of the screen is not a flat surface. It's kind of ridged, which puts a damper on my plans of pasting stickers all over it; the stickers would just peel up. And 2) the track pad for the cursor sucks sometimes. I have to almost put a lot of force behind pressing it to get the cursor to select something. I'm going to be investing in a small wireless mouse soon, so I don't have to worry about it anymore.",
"I bought this laptop to use for school work which is about all that I needed it for. The laptop is light making it bearable to carry around for class or to work to be able to type up the paper or do research needed. The internet speed is relevant to other laptops as there isn't delay time and waiting for the browser to load. A nice feature was that it came with Microsoft Office for one year which is helpful to the pocket for those that are using this laptop for that reason. I would recommend using a flash drive or external memory device to store any work that you are saving, unless you are using a cloud option.  Battery life is relatively good as I can use it all day without it being a problem and it charges pretty quick as well. The overall quality for the price of this laptop makes it worth it.",
"I purchased this laptop on July 15th 2019.

Same story as several of the other one star reviewers. Got computer out of the box…powered it up…black spot on the screen. I should’ve known to just send it back right away but I foolishly thought the black spot isn’t that bad…I can work with this. But it began spreading to other parts of the screen. I called HP and they sent a repair box to my home to have the laptop shipped to their repair center in Texas.

A week or so goes by and I get a note saying that there is an internal crack in the screen. They declared it accidental damage outside of the coverage of my warranty and requested $378.46 to make the repair. Me giving HP twice what it originally cost to buy the laptop is not happening.

Because HP made me send it to them in their special repair box, I have the box that it originally arrived in—there is not a scuff, ding, or dent on this thing. So I am at an utter loss to figure out when this damage occurred—it was a fulfilled by Amazon product through a third party seller. Did HP ship it out like that, did something happen at the fulfillment center. Either way, this shouldn't be my problem. HP disagreed.

At any rate, I would have liked to hope that HP would stand behind their products better, but apparently I was naïve. I did not damage this laptop. I think it is ludicrous to ask someone to pay twice what they originally paid for the laptop just to have what I should’ve had in the first place. They have managed to lose a proud HP customer of over a decade who has three other HP computers in the home. All I wanted was a functioning laptop without a crack in the screen and HP failed.

You are playing roulette if you buy this laptop. I will not be purchasing another HP Laptop.",
"i have only had this laptop a couple of days so far i love it. it came in windows 10 s mode i did switch out of it. to do that just google it for instructions. first time start up was a breeze and a program called cortina walks you threw everything. its fast with my 5g wifi it dosn't skip and studder. i bought the new one when you purchase this laptop make sure you are buying the new on not the refubished ones it makes a world of diffrence. if something changes i will update.

it is august 2nd 2019 and every once in a while when browsing the internet the screen will go black and I have to hold down the esc key and try to move the mouse to the x to get it to come back on at this point I still love my laptop but I don't think it will last long and I have down graded the stars from 5 to 3 I will review again soon

It is June 23 2020 now the laptop goes to sleep when closing the top and doesn't wake up till you hit the power button and it goes threw the main screen like your turning it on after being shut down and it now gives me a warning screen that I'm running out of space",
"Appearance: Even though it is not expensive, it looks very cool. doesn't look cheap. Performance: I has an apple, pavilion, rugged latitude dell. This computer works just fine. Although, it comes in s mode and with Microsoft edge all you have to do is take it out of s mode. I did this in about a minute when downloading adobe. also I downloaded google chrome. edges' performance is good but not compatible for certain things... for instance downloading driving record at tx.dps. the computer comes with a year of office. also a terabyte of cloud storage. its not slow. I got like 20 windows with youtube on all the time. works fine.
Update: battery is good. also computer gives you tips and tricks to use in order to better your experience on the screen when coming out of sleep mode. does have an hdmi port and bluetooth.",
"This is a good little laptop.

It's little and it's fast!  It's perfect for web browsing, creating/editing office documents.  On my next travel, I would definitely carry it with me.

The only downside (which I'm okay with, as I don't use it for more than just the above) is the storage space.  After doing a clean Windows 10 install and setting up MS Office, I ended up with a little over 12GB of free storage.

I would recommend this little laptop to anyone looking to do some web surfing and office work.

Note:  The laptop I received had a bump on the lower-right side of the cover.  I don't know if this is by design or a defect, but it can be a bit annoying.",
"I love the size and weight of this Windows Laptop.  Since I only do research and check my email messages, it is convenient and ideal.  Important caveats:  1) If you already have virus protection software (other than McAfee that was offered for an additional fee if purchasing this particular laptop), you will not be able to download your preferred software because it is in 'S' mode (please look up its meaning).  Unless one is computer-savvy, a low-tech person will not be happy if they are not able to find someone to remove 'S' mode.  Downloading any type of software --  is blocked, period.  I have to take it elsewhere to remove 'S' mode in near future.  2) HP website is not user-friendly.  Options for what you need is not readily available.  A 'Community Forum' may be impressive to others but I was not impressed when I could not easily navigate in order to find what I needed.  3) Although I just bought the laptop a few days ago, after putting in info for warranty, laptop warranty had only 4 months left (?!?!).  I tried to chat but after inputting dispute warranty info, I never connected to anyone and it buffered for a couple of minutes.  I'll see how it works out if 'S' mode can easily be removed, to include its performance.  Besides not easily connecting with HP to resolve my needs and having to drive elsewhere to remove 'S' mode, I hope the computer performs well, especially for the reasonable price.",
"I use this as a second laptop if I need one that's smaller than my 15.6''. It's a nice little thing. Not very much RAM, so keep that in mind, but it's a good internet surfer and word processor. For it's purposes, it's great. Firefox does crash on it quite a bit and it doesn't have too much storage, but it's not meant to be your main laptop, just a travel one that's smaller than the main deal. Use it as such and you'll be fine.",
"I was hoping that this machine would behave well under Linux, and so far, it has.

Everything works. Sound, GPU, Wifi, battery detection, suspend.

It's exactly what I needed. A simple, small, light, long battery life laptop to do software development on at a Denny's without lugging around my very heavy Thinkpad and unplugging it from everything.

Keyboard does not have a lot of travel or feedback, but strangely, it's actually a LOT better than most cheap laptops. Touch typists will like this machine, as long as they aren't mechanical keyboard cultists.

I was wary of HP machines in recent years as I had heard they had gotten quite bad, but this has been a surprisingly good experience so far.

Not only is secure boot easily disabled and doesn't require an admin password (looking at you, Acer), but it also provides legacy/CSM BIOS emulation support, in case UEFI isn't your thing.

eMMC storage speed is phenominal, even if there's only 32GB of space. I'm using a heavily compressed Btrfs partition for my root filesystem, so I can manage.

This machine exceeded my expectations. It's not perfect, the build quality, while better than I expected, still leaves a bit to be desired. It seems to attract crumbs and grime like a magnet, which is annoying, and the touchpad is NOT particularly sensitive, which gets annoying quickly. You need more pressure than you should to get its attention so you can move the cursor.

HP, if you're reading this, you've done well. A slight thing that you did in one previous machine that you should do again: allow booting from microSD. That's a very useful feature.",
"Bought this for my parents July 9, 2019. It looked like an affordable solution since all they do is access the internet, play a few card/word games, and use Microsoft Word fairly regularly. That it had Office 365 included made it very appealing for the price. The case is a cheap plastic, but adequate for their needs and they typically take decent care of their technology.

There were a couple of hiccups with lag when we first got it set up, but those were overcome and it worked fine for a bit with no phone calls requesting support. *sigh of relief*

UNTIL... three months after purchase, my dad complained he was unable to connect to the internet. They had been away caring for family for three months, so I assumed reconnecting to their home network was the problem and chalked it up to user error. I tried to walk him through troubleshooting and we determined he needed to update drivers, but since there isn't an ethernet port and my schedule wouldn't allow me to troubleshoot in person, I sent him to Geek Squad for resolution. They determined the network adapter had failed and that updating drivers was inadequate to fix the problem. I arranged to get the computer from my parents to process the warranty (we live in different cities) because I thought I could do it faster/more efficiently if I had it in front of me. WRONG.

When I put in the serial number to verify the warranty, HP's records showed the warranty began June 28, 2018 and expired August 1, 2019. This computer was listed as new. Now, I did dispute the warranty status and received an email from HP indicating they had updated the terms of the warranty, but every attempt to invoke said warranty to get the computer repaired or replaced gets me in a loop of troubleshooting and when I use the automated system to check the warranty status, it still shows it to be expired. I don't know if it would be easier to use warranty if it were listed as active because I don't have that choice. But at the moment, I am waiting for a phone call from HP (which also had to be requested online) to see what happens next. Seemed like a great opportunity to share my experience thus far.

Now I realized this is a budget laptop and the price was ""too good to be true"" -- but that seemed all the more reason to write this review. Whether it be quality control or luck of the draw, my experience with the HP Stream does not make me want to buy another HP product. Ever. The hours I have spent on this to date are gone forever. I hope I save someone else the trouble. You live; you learn.",
"I recently was in the market for a new workbook / laptop, I have owned several high-end Macbooks in the past but was in search of something simply for browsing, streaming and word editing without spending hundreds if not thousands of dollars.

I was reluctant at first to purchase this product because of Windows 10, but once you get the hang of it it really isn't that bad. The laptop comes preloaded with Windows S mode but prior to the previous review all you have to due is enable the full Windows 10 version in the settings which does not cost you a penny more other than using more store. For example with nothing other than Windows 10 full version + google chrome my laptop only has about 8GBs left of free space which in and of itself is not surprising.

This laptop comes with 2x USB 2.0 inputs, while they're not 3.0 like some of the more expense chromebooks I don't really have the need for this as most of my information / data is stored on the cloud, which this includes 1 year free with up-to 1TB of storage, a great freebie.

The laptop also comes with Windows Office Home edition for a full year for free which was a great surprise and money saver. It also comes standard with a HDMI output and micro sd which is amazing to help bump up the storage on this little guy. Currently have the micro SD slot filled with a 64BG chip from an old gopro and have just loaded it up with movies, music and TV shows.

My favorite thing about this laptop other than the cost, has to be the size, weight and battery life. Compared to some of the bigger counterparts offered this is absolutely perfect for close range use like when on a plane, train or back-seat of the car because the screen is just big enough it doesn't hurt your eyes staring at it for too long.

My least favorite thing so far about this laptop has to be the screen not having a good anti-glare setup on it and while this isn't that bad to deal with it, it does get annoying in heavily lighted areas :(

Otherwise, for the cost of this laptop I would happily purchase another, between the laptop + extended 2yr warranty the total for this product was roughly $210. Best $210 I have ever spent without the hassle of worrying about spending $700-$1500 on a laptop and picking the wrong one or disliking the product over all.

If this laptop lasts me for the 2 years of my warranty than that is fine by me this is the perfect little travel companion for anyone who is on the road and tired of lugging around big heavy laptops that battery life barely exceed 6 hours when using for streaming more or less data editing.

This laptop while streaming Netflix/Hulu/Etc, seems to last me about 10-12 hours without dying! I have yet to drain the battery significantly while doing word processing on it.

10/10 would recommend for anyone who needs a little laptop to travel with, or something for home use when you want to sit on the sofa and not have to be plugged in or burn your legs to a crisp!",
"I'm writing this review from this very laptop I've had for all of 2 hours. First and foremost, I already have firefox downloaded and the S mode disabled. Took like 10 minutes. Went to mozilla, tried to download, then a popup asked me if I wanted to disable S mode for free. Select yes, let it do its thing and now I have regular windows 10. Peasy.

This thing is a miniature version of our HP15. The keyboard is great quality, nearly identical to our HP15 which doesn't have the premium keyboard. But it lacks the 10 digit numerical pad to the right side, which I don't particularly miss. There are number keys 1-0 up top here. I don't do a lot of data entry, and I'm sure as hell not going to be doing any mobile banking in the middle of a Starbucks. U do that stuff at home where no one can see your keystrokes anyway, or hack your computer. I'm really able to use it well as a touch typist, it supplies a light click touchback with predictable force across the different keys. Touch typists know this can be important. Little things like sticky or wonky keys can really mess up your flow. It's pleasantly quiet with a polite click rather than the intrusive clack clack of some keyboards. The mousepad is quite responsive. Not top notch, mind you, but for this little thing, very good and quite usable. It does two finger scrolling more precisely than the more expensive HP15, which is to say, not stellar but ok. You can also left and right click with light touch or with pushing the mouse pad like a button. This feature is quite sensitive and impressively functional for this size and price. Though do what everyone else does and get a good wireless mouse.

It of course, is much smaller, lighter than the HP15 (which I use as comparison because we happen to own it, and its similarity to this model) and great for on the go. No DVD/CD drive, fewer ports and smaller 11.5"" screen are mostly responsible for that. But perhaps most significantly, so is the lack of a real hard drive. It has solid state memory (sturdier, lighter than ""normal"" hard drives with discs and moving parts inside), which also means it doesn't have very much. 32gb built in. Pretty underwhelming. It does have a micro SD expansion slot, and some of these micro cards pack quite a bit of memory, depending on how much you want to pay, and they can get pricey. I've seen them go up to 400 GB. Keep in mind that some essential programs - like Windows - can only be stored on internal memory and can't use an SD card. It has 2 USB ports and an HDMI port, so you could use an external hard drive or a flash drive for extra memory if you wanted. Comes with 1 yr free Microsoft cloud storage with up to 1 TB. Never used it, haven't signed up for it. No idea how much it costs after 1 yr. Not sure I trust it, either...but anyway, its an option.

It also comes with 1 year of microsoft office, which is pretty darn sweet cuz that sweet suite is expensive. Haven't used the most recent iteration, so can't comment on that, but if its anything like it was in 2010-2012 should be good stuff.

It looks like it can run 2-3 apps at the same time, depending on the app of course. I wouldn't use it for anything but ""light"" gaming. It can struggle with its whopping (read: not whopping) 4 GB RAM. Has an intel celeron N4000 processor, so about 1.1ghz. Fast, but quite limited by its unimpressive 4 GB. Which, I wouldn't get any laptop that had less than that, and many of the competitors do have less at very similar prices. If you're looking for a powerhouse, high performance machine, look elsewhere. My intended use is for on the go light browsing, checking emails, voice chatting without lugging a large heavy laptop around. I barely notice the weight in my bag. It seems to fit the bill perfectly so far. I'll try to come back and make comments as I have it for a bit longer.
5/2/19 Update: Still loving this thing. Corrected some mistakes above like the processor speed. I have been using this thing, surfing, typing, changing settings for the past 1.5 -2 hrs from full battery, and is now at 88%. This battery is really impressing me so far. Half expecting that as I use this more, and the battery becomes more drained, how fast the battery drains changes. You've likely noticed these battery inconsistencies in your devices before. You know that after XX% on the battery, its all downhill from there, discharges quickly after that. We'll see if this does that. Will leave on standby overnight, see where the % is tomorrow. Also have yet to try camera for skype, alexa, etc.
5/21/19: No battery inconsitency. Speed of drain seems constant and predictable. I have left this thing on standby for over a week with only about 12% drop in power. Very impressive. The HP15 would have been dead after a few days on standby. Also, the more I use the mouse and keyboard, the more impressed I become with them. I said above the mouse in particular is ""not stellar but ok"". I take this back. Like a new phone, it takes a little getting used to, but I now find myself using a wireless mouse less and less and just using the built in mousepad. Sensitive and accurate. I highly recommend this laptop, I've been very impressed with it so far. Just be sure you know what you'll be using it for and its limitations and you shouldn't be disappointed. I would buy it again in a heartbeat.",
"Loving it, and recommend it!",
Basically for personal use,
"Beautiful design and look Chromebook, my daughter liked it so much ??, just opened it today, will update battery life later",
I don’t have any dislike regarding this HP lab top I got it for my daughter this is her first year in college and she loves it it does everything that she needs it to I definitely give a five star if your daughter is just starting college this is a great gift,
My laptop is great.  It has a very good battery life and I use it probably 4 or 5 times a week.  If it is not in use it last for several days still on.  The main reason for purchase was the touch screen. I use my phone mostly so having that capability is awesome.  No new software needed at time of review since it is 2021 model.,
Just buy this. You will not be disappointed.,
"Screen quality is awful, so dull and grey. Adjusting the brightness does nothing! Listen to the reviews. I loved every other feature but the awful screen quality.",
I dislike the fact that since I had to return the product because it wouldn’t work with my software I got charged over $80 restocking fee with no idea I was going to be charged. That’s crap,
Genial para las clases por zoom ....super rápido su sistema operativo,
Nice feel to the keyboard. Good screen quality. Very happy with the performance overall.,
Touch screen and battery life,
"I just purchased this after reading reviews. I thought it was the right choice for me even with the one comment I read about the screen resolution. I thought surely it was only one person.
Well guess what that person was right!
The screen resolution SUCKS!! I even went into settings and adjusting the brightness etc. It did nothing to help.
I am not happy that I just spent $$ on something that is going to totally annoy me.
HP FIX THIS ASAP!!
Does anyone know if I can return this?",
"Very disappointed by this product. While it's functional and fast and easy set up, make sure it's 100% of what you want. The resolution on the screen is horrible, very dim, dull and faded. I spoke to 3 tech supports and no one could officially determine if it was a defect. Everyone said turn up the brightness, this didn't work at all! I was told by NexiPC they would see if it was defective or not, but only would know if I mailed it off...in this case I would be without a computer and would be out a lot of money considering the 20% restocking fee. First and last time I will ever buy an HP product or a computer on Amazon. Lastly, if your considering the Asurion coverage, while they are friendly they don't have answers and tell you to just return it. Very disappointed, don't waste your money.",
Like it all but haven't had it long enough,
Haven’t had a laptop in years and this one is so nice. Love the touch screen,
Have only had for a few weeks and no complaints yet. Seems easy to use and love the touch screen option.,
my wife liked it.,
"I've been pleasantly surprised with this! I can watch tons of videos and the battery lasts for an entire day and then some! We use it for homeschooling as well. There are some education apps that my kids just love. It's very lightweight and I love how you can make it just the screen or use the keyboard, too. Highly recommend!!",
This laptop is great for my son’s online schooling. We have also used it as a tablet for games. The screen is bright and the computer is sleek and light. Good device for the price!!,
"Each new edition of Windows became worse. Windows 2000 and Vista were the last OS's reasonable for home use. Chromebook is perfect for home use; fast, easy to learn and a good suite of features. I'm hesitant to have so much of my stuff in the cloud, but that's where the world is going, apparently.",
"I got this laptop on June 2021, by Dec. 2022 it is making all kind of noises, the cooling fan is going all crazy, this has not even been use to the max, since it is not use for gaming, just watching a video and running spread sheets has this laptop crying with all kind of rattling sounds.

To me, it was a big investment, I paid over $1.5k, I expected it to last longer without presenting issues.  *AFTER 1 YEAR RAZER WARRANTY EXPIRES, AND AMAZON RETURN WINDOW IS LONG GONE*

IF YOU GOING TO INVEST THAT KIND OF MONEY THINK ABOUT IT AND LOOK FOR BETTER OPTIONS.",
Build quality is surperb no comparsions. Good laptop not disappoint. It is expensive but you are paying for that build quality.,
"Great little laptop with the best display. Good value for the OLED panel.  Once you use a display like the one on this pc, you'll never be satisfied with LED displays.",
"Screen is very nice for gaming, media, and productivity with a 144Hz refresh rate, comfortable to carry around, sleek design, and durable build. The battery doesn't last that long (4 hours or so) but that's to be expected of most gaming laptops unless you tweak a lot of the settings.",
"This laptop has almost no palm rejection. If interfacing with your computer is a constant struggle then nothing else really matters. I could hardly type for more than 10 seconds before my palms would register on the track pad and toggle something, move the cursor somewhere else, or whatever other random event.

I've had many laptops over the years and this is by for the worst I've ever experienced. There are many other issues, starting from the fact that it's a finger print magnet to the fact that it has abysmal battery life, but none of that matters because it doesn't even get the basics right.",
No complaints what so ever. Much cheaper than building a pc around a rtx2070 at the moment. I got this to replace a desktop and honestly have no regrets.,
"Wanted for engineering school and to occasionally run racing sims

Pros: runs solidworks unmatched, will run assetto corsa and similar games on highest graphics settings, has taken everything I’ve thrown at it so far in stride

Cons: little memory, not good for gaming for long (heats up quite a bit), battery life is eh",
My son loves this laptop for speed and lightness of transporting it. Excellent for school.,
"I have used computers for about 50 years and have always used desktops. This is my first desktop replacement and I will never replace my steps. It is great for games, communication, and everyday use. It already has my turbo tax software installed for this tax season.",
Really nice computer- only issue I have is the fan running at all times at crazy high rate.,
"I've had mine for a couple of months now and it has been perfect to me. Defect reviews will always stand out, and that was what made me so hesitant and reluctant to place an order. If there is a problem, just return it through Amazon. The fans are a little annoying and high pitched when plugged in and inside a quiet room.",
"Not even a year after use. I bought this computer in April, and not even a few months down the line. This computer's screen broke. I never dropped it, I never spilled anything on it, never bashed it with anything. I sent it after speaking with Razer's customer support, they deemed it defective and offered a replacement. Well, a full month after, almost going on 2. Razer has not sent me a replacement. Everytime I asked what's going on with my replacement all they have to say is ""we're sorry, we're still waiting on an update, please expect an update in 24-48 hours."" Well, they might as well say 24-48 months instead or just give me the middle finger. DO NOT BUY THIS COMPUTER, IF YOU DID, GET A GOOD PROTECTION PLAN. IF YOU DIDN'T AND YOUR LAPTOP STARTS TO SHOW ISSUES, DO NOT SEND IT IN. YOU DO NOT WANT TO LOSE BOTH THE LAPTOP AND YOUR MONEY. AT LEAST IF YOU KEEP THE LAPTOP YOU CAN SELL IT FOR SCRAP.",
"I've been looking into this laptop for a while and when I actually got it in hand I wasn't really satisfied. Sure the gaming was great, nice resolution and good fps. Materials felt sturdy but oil and sweat from the hands really showed on the case. Sure wipe it down but again it became dirty. The fans were too loud especially using Chrome or any other applications. It gets really hot when gaming so not comfortable for long game sessions.",
"This laptop is draining batter like crazy, a full charge only last about 1hr max. The fan constantly are running on the background and it hot like hell on the lap, make sure you have it only something or you might get burn. Other than that it's a ok laptop.",
"Excelente, buen equipo, tal cual recomendado...sin inconvenientes, jugando los titulos mas recientes, sin calentar por temperatura...

If you want to purchase this laptop...I recommend 100%, must to understand the best gaming laptop always the battery consumption is about 3 to 4 hours...and this laptop with some configurations it support to 7 hours...",
"Amazing ! It got here super quick and was ready for me to set up as soon as i opened it, and the chroma is super customizable. The only thing is sometimes the fans will get a little loud, but it never lasts for too long and you could also purchase external cooling devices for it. Overall amazing purchase.",
"I got this during a sale, upgraded my laptop from a Macbook to this and I am genuinely happy on jumping ship. I love how not gamery it looks other than the Razer logo.

The performance is really great although battery life without the charger goes by quickly even though I use it for media consumption since I do all my gaming on my beefier desktop PC.",
"Good laptop for gaming and has insane power.

One con is the fan sound. Its very noisy even compared to my desktop with 4 fans in it. I guess its a trade off when you pack so much power into small chassis.",
I have this laptop for 1 month and it's a very good laptop regardless of the battery life and fan noise while playing games. overall it is a good product I highly recommend it.,
"This baby runs Skyrim at max settings at 60/fps. The battery life is abysmal ( 1 hour of Skyrim before I have to recharge.), but beings that I never take this baby out much, that isn’t that big of an issue. Razor sharp screen, fantastic sound. What more can I ask? Satisfied!",
I love Razer’s laptops. They’re really well built and a wonderful product. I’ll recommend this laptop to anyone who can afford it. It’s not for everyone but it might just be right for you. I purchased the Mercury White one and the Black one for my significant other.,
The first time a deliver guy put my mail in the back door?I also called customer service to check my email.But about the laptop is perfect.That is amazing?I using MacBook long time?I know ios is good for office but no gaming?so I just want to buy the Win10 for some games?but I didn't have much hope for the Razer?I can not believe the 144Hz screen will be clearer than the MacBook?but It is do that?i7-10750 CPU and 2060 Max-Q GPU let me get a new world like haven?,
"Purchased March 2021: I am in the process of contacting Razer support without success. In the past few months, the track pad has gotten tighter and tighter to where it will no longer click anywhere on the pad.

The laptop also runs extremely hot and the keyboard cannot be touched during a gaming episode (I haven't gamed with it in ages because I am afraid it's going to explode). I have primarily used the laptop for school interspersed with relatively low impact games like Kerbal Space Program or Civilization on lower settings. The games run very poorly, the laptop runs super hot, and the trackpad has died.... all in about a year since purchase. Pretty unacceptable for a $2000 laptop - not to mention that the battery seems like it's swollen and potentially poses a genuine risk to users.

Please contact me, Razer, so that I can update this review based on what I have heard is great customer service. I'd like to get the problem resolved so I can use the laptop like normal again.",
"I could immediately tell from the packaging that Razer is not messing around. Everything was professionally packaged and upon opening, everything is high quality and created with love of gaming in mind.

This computer runs great, plays all my games on max settings and doesn't get too loud. The screen, keyboard, speakers, trackpad, RGB, everything is top notch as I expected it to be. I bought a Bluetooth Razer mouse to go along with it and I now have the ultimate laptop gaming setup.

Thank you Razer.",
"Razer makes great machines and this is no exception! I’ve owned this laptop for a month now and so far has been a joy. There are no issues and plenty of power for this machine. Sure it is not the most powerful, but considering its form factor and how thin it is... it packs plenty of power. It is a good purchase if you buy it on sale!",
Powerful machine that had little problem handling all the games I threw at it. Would recommend capping titles to 60fps as uncapped the machine doesnt have adequate cooling.,
This thing is fast!  Windows boots in 5 seconds.  Handles everything I throw at it.  Yes the fans do get quite loud at times but a pair of isolating headphones fixes that.  I do a lot of emulation and being able to play XBC:X in Cemu at 60+ framerates with internal resolution at 4K makes this a winner for me.,
"Faster than my ryzen desktop build (with a 1070 ti). Used mainly for After Effects and C4D renders at work - overall impressed. Only issue is that it gets insanely hot under heavy work load and gaming... like all gaming laptop, so expected. Just make sure you buy an elevated stand so cool air can keep moving through the unit. overall, love it. It's  a beast.",
"I am a Mac user, and this is my first PC gaming laptop. I use it with my Oculus Quest link to play PC VR games. I like the metal chassis and the build quality. No dead pixel or blacklight bleed. So far it plays all my PC VR games without any issue. It is running hot but all gaming laptop do. My laptop model only come with 512GB SSD, but luckily there is an open M.2. SSD expansion slot, so I added 2TB SSD. Overall I am happy with this purchase.",
"This is an excellent laptop. The build design is nice, the only problem I've had with it is that it collects fingerprints extremely fast. I just keep a solution in my bag and wipe it down after every use to counter that. I have yet to have it overheat, and it has played pretty much everything I put at it perfectly fine. Battery life isn't great, but its a gaming laptop and spends most of its time plugged in, so that is sort of a non-factor to me.",
"This is my first gaming laptop and it’s just fly through all the games and one of the best laptop out there. Yes there are few hiccups but this is the best out there. Wanna play and work and have the best design. You came to the right place. Razor has the best battery, best gaming performance a pc can offer in this range and portable. #Razor.",
"I use this PC primarily to share my screen when teaching and the software I use is PPT, Streaming Videos, and whiteboard.

To be honest I have way more processing power than I need but the laptop is always screaming its fan at me.

In addition to that if you like to put your laptop on your lap this is not the one for you, the edges are so sharp and often times pierces me, doesn’t hurt but it is really annoying and uncomfortable

I cant vouch for gaming havent used it for that.

But the speaker is good!",
"The laptop is okay, not a bad laptop but for the price I expect everything that comes with the laptop to be worth the price but no. The charger sucks and only charges when it’s plugged in a certain way/ position, meaning it’s got a really weak connection.  I returned my first one for the same reason because I thought it was just a defective charger cable/brick but the second one I got was the same way so I know it’s Razor’s problem.",
"My only gripe is that there is coil whine.
If you're using wired earbuds or headphones, you'll hear a buzzing noise when the gpu is under load. So this basically ruins gaming with wired headphones.
After a bit of googling, it seems that coil whine isn't an uncommon issue for gaming laptops and there's not much you can do to fix it.",
"This is my first gaming laptop. I've been using it for about a year now and it has been incredible. The 512gb ssd filled up incredibly fast thanks to game pass ultimate, but it is super easy and takes roughly 10 minutes to upgrade. Once I upgraded the RAM I was able to run almost all my games in ultra settings. Very pleased",
"Great Product overall! I've seen a few gaming laptops but the performance on the is beats any laptop cheaper than this. Despite a short battery life (which is expected when using the features it has to offer) I haven't ran into any bad issues (knocks on wood).
P.S. can mistake it for a heater if left in your lap throughout time of use (^,^)",
"I shopped parts for desktop build.  Video cards being difficult to acquire and 2-3X $$$ I thought welp let's see what a gaming laptop gets us.  I bought my 15"" Razor from Amazon warehouse.  The laptop came with an I7 6 core and a 2060 RTX along with 16GB memory.  It was around $1,100.

3rd night I had it I started playing 3 Kingdoms with no issues.  IT WILL GET HOT.  I'll be purchasing a cooling pad before long gaming sessions.  Overall I am happy, hoping it will last.",

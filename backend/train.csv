"I bought the A1500 based on the Compaq name and the excellent results I`ve had with their other products, however I started having problems immediatly, it just would not work. When I called Tech support, I was informed that it was not campatible with my operating system. When I pointed out I was using Win 98se on a Compaq comupter they tried to help. I was able to finally get it installed after being on the phone with Tech Support for almost 2 hours. It worked for one day then quit printing. When I again called Tech Support and spent another hour on the phone the printer finally started working but the Scanner quit. As I was buying a second computer with Win XP I asked if it would be compatible and was assured that it was.
When I was ready to install the A1500 on the new computer, I called Tech Support and they taslked me through the whole process. Not only would it not install it crashed my system and I had to do a full restore.
As I waited to long to return it, it is now seating on a shelf collecting dust until I can find someone who will take it off my hands. In the mean time I`m still looking for a good multifunction that will work as advertised.
I would not recommend the A1500 to anyone who does not have money and time to waste.","['base compaq', 'excellent result ve product', 'tech support', 'system point', 'se compaq comupter', 'instal phone tech support hour work day', 'tech support', 'hour phone printer', 'work scanner', 'ready install', 'new computer', 'tech support taslke process install crash system restore', 'return seat shelf', 'time look good multifunction work advertise', 'money time waste']"
"The A1500 was the first multifunctional I've used.  I purchase one in 2001 for about $100. Overall, it was a decent machine before it began to die.

It takes two ink cartridges, Lexmark black-12A1970 ($25-$32) and Lexmark color-12A1985 ($29-$39).  The ink seemed to last for a good while.  However, if you don't use the cartridges in a while, the ink will dry up (this is what happened to my color cartridge a few times).

When I first purchased it, I thought the design was great, but as I needed copies and scans of different items, I changed my mind.  The copier/scanner is operated via a feeder instead of being a flatbed.  I couldn't scan a page from a book or magazine (unless I wanted to rip out the page and feed it to the machine).  It was also somewhat difficult to make copies of smaller items such as cards, IDs or pictures, even with the protective sleeve that is included with this model.

Before Compaq was bought out by HP, there was Compaq Customer Communities where consumers could post questions and give answers to one another (I had an alignment problem with this unit that was easily solved by a visit to Customer Communities).  Unfortunately, HP removed the community.  I guess it's a good thing I got the 3 year warranty from Circuit City.  After about a year and a half, the scanner and copier started to act up.  I would no longer get clean scans/copies, and it would use two 8.5"" x 11"""" pages to copy a single document with the same dimensions.  Customer Service couldn't help with the problem","['multifunctional purchase overall', 'decent machine', 'ink cartridge lexmark', 'black lexmark color ink good use cartridge ink dry', 'color cartridge time purchase', 'great need copy scan', 'different item', 'mind copi scanner', 'scan page book magazine', 'rip page feed machine', 'difficult copy', 'small item card id picture', 'protective sleeve', 'model compaq', 'hp compaq customer communities consumer post question', 'alignment problem unit', 'visit customer communities', 'community guess', 'good thing', 'year warranty circuit city year', 'scanner copi', 'long clean scan copy use page copy single document dimension customer service']"
"After having been impressed with the ASUS EeePC 901 for the last year, I decided to buy a bigger ASUS laptop as a gift for one of my kids. I ended up getting the F80Q-X2AM because it's bigger than a netbook but it's not really big. The 14.1 inch screen and full sized keyboard are just what I was looking for. This laptop has everything you could want: DVD player, webcam, big hard drive, lots of RAM, memory card reader, wireless network card, bluetooth, decent carrying case.  Good stuff. On top of that, the 2-year warranty, accidental damage protection, and spill-proof keyboard are really nice, especially for a laptop going to a young kid.

The only thing I don't like about this laptop is the operating system. Windows Vista is for the birds, and I'm not just saying that. I've had bad experiences with Vista in the past, so I'm biased negatively with respect to Vista. On the other hand, I used to work at Microsoft and I like the company a lot. But when it takes 3 hours to get connected to a wireless network, you know you're using a crummy operating sytem. Specifically, I encountered the infamous ""unidentified network"""" problem which millions of others have likely experienced over the last couple of years with Vista. Although there's seemingly no sure fire way to fix the problem","['impress asus eeepc year', 'big asus laptop gift kid end', 'big netbook', 'big inch screen', 'keyboard look laptop', 'dvd player webcam', 'big hard drive lot ram memory card reader wireless network card bluetooth', 'case good stuff year warranty accidental damage protection spill proof keyboard', 'young kid thing', 'system windows vista bird', 'bad experience vista past bias', 'respect vista hand work microsoft', 'company lot', 'wireless network', 'encounter infamous', 'network problem', 'likely experience couple year vista', 'sure fire way fix problem']"
"I bought this notebook based on it's great specifications. It would certainly be a good notebook if it was dependable. It is not. I have never had so much trouble with a computer. The operating system constantly gets corrupted. The computer freezes frequently resulting in a hard restarts which further corrupts the system. Sent it in to be looked at by Asus after informing them that I had reinstalled the operating system 5 times and thought either the motherboard or memory was bad. Also told them one of the USB ports was defective. All they did was reinstall the operating system. I had already done that 5 times in a matter of 3 weeks. They did not even test the hardware.

The display is not very good. Very bad viewing angles. Blacks are not black, but grey. Buttons are hard to click. Fingerprint device does not load when booting. The video card is very good, too bad the rest of the system is not well designed and components faulty. I may have to get with my credit card company on this one as Asus doesn't seem very interested in repairing it and I am ready to throw it in the garbage. Sony and Macintosh products are much superior, but don't offer such a great video card.

Overall, I would not recommend this notebook to anyone, unless you enjoy frustration. I have owned over 10 notebooks over the last 15 years or so, and this is the worst of the bunch. Stay away, look at Sony, Dell or Apple instead.

Added March 2010: Bought a Sony Vaio CW. Great computer. Now I can ditch this Asus N81 crap. No system corruption no matter what I install. This is how a computer should run. There has got to be an incompatibility with Windows and Asus software.

"Why did I buy it: wanted a 13-14inch with good power, so found this with slightly positive reviews , warranty/insurance, very powerful, 14inch, good ventilation. Didn't get Dell studio 14z (price, too much heat, no dvd), sony vaio CW (price), HP DV4t (price if configured the same), DELL StudioXPS 13 (price, heat issues, battery duration,small touchpad)
have had it for 5 days so far ... Got it for [850$ from amazon] (could have gotten it for [...] if I used bing cashback and [...] )
Pros:
-Very powerful.. CPU , GPU , HDD (7200rpm).. it got 5.9 on windows experience index because of the HDD, the CPU/RAM gets 6.4 & GPU gets 6.6 .that's with win 7 64bit, it got as far as I remember ; 5.4 or 5.9 on the CPU with vista 32bit that came with it..
-Sooo cheap for such power
-Looks nice; not super nice, but nice..
-Very well ventilation design .. for all that power, it doesn't get hot.
-included mouse (not wireless) and bag...
-full array of ports ( including FIVE usb ports, that is amazing )
Cons:
when you have so much power, the input devices should be up to the same standard; they are not
-No backlit keyboard.. I know; I knew this before buying it; but when you get it and can't see the f1/f12 keys in the dark and can't see the WIFI / Bluetooth either ; not even the power button if it is not turned on ...

-FN key on left of CTRL key ... VERY VERY Stupid .. I already knew, but thought I can adapt; not yet..
-Horrible sounding and functioning touchpad buttons .. needs too much power to press and makes too much noise .. I already knew thru reviews but didn't appreciate how bad they are .. I honestly try to avoid using them ..
-Now the worst part; the left side of the keyboard is so flimsy that when pressing any of those keys (ESC,`,1,2,TAB,Q,W,A,S,CAPS,LT SHIFT, Z,LT CTRL,FN) it makes so much noise ... you won't appreciate how frustrating or annoying this is until you use it ... Same about trying to avoid using them, except u can't
-The DVD tray button is very difficult to press without directly looking at it ...
- the scrolling bar on the touchpad is a hit/miss, you have to press the line drawn on the touchpad exactly for it to work , and it keeps scrolling even after u remove your finger, u have to press it again like u r applying a brake .. STUPID DESIGN ..
- unresponsive keys: sometimes some keys don't respond to pressing them leading to too many typing errors ..
- poooor battery life, though it is understandable, but at least ASUS should offer a 9 cell option ...

"I bought this laptop back in January because I needed something portable, yet with a little more punch than what I could normally find in this price group. It's got plenty of space and easily handles the programs I usually run at the same time--Explorer, OneNote, Outlook, Photoshop/Illustrator, Media Player. Six months later, it's still running well with no problems and I'm continually glad I made the purchase.

I also do some casual gaming with it, thanks to the Nvidia graphics card. Games like Dragon Age push it to it's limits, but it can still handle newer games. It has no trouble with anything older than that (unless there are compatibility issues between the game and Windows 7.

I plan on using this laptop as I return to graduate school and feel like it's size, weight, and speed will work well for me to use it mainly for work, and a bit of entertainment on the side.

My chief complaints, which keep me from giving it 5 stars, are that it doesn't have separate media buttons for changing the volume (though this can be done by holding the function key and hitting F11 or F12), it's lack of various video output ports, and that the speakers distort when turned up all the way. Maybe it's not the best choice for one looking for a machine dedicated primarily to entertainment, but that doesn't mean you can't enjoy some light gaming or movies with it.","['laptop january need', 'portable little punch', 'price group', 'plenty space', 'time explorer onenote outlook photoshop illustrator media player month', 'run problem', 'glad purchase casual', 'nvidia graphic card game', 'dragon age', 'new game trouble', 'old compatibility issue game windows plan laptop return graduate school', 'size weight speed work use', 'work bit entertainment chief complaint', 'separate medium button', 'volume hold function key', 'lack video output port speaker distort', 'good choice look machine dedicate']"
"Let me start by saying that I love my laptop. I had desktops all my life, so this was my first laptop. I did a LOT of research before choosing the ASUS K50IJ-D2 15.6-Inch model, and for the price I can easily say that it was well worth it. I find this laptop a good size for me. If you are looking for a super-thin and ultra-light laptop like a Macbook Air, this isn't the product for you. If you're looking for a dependable and quality laptop for usage mainly within the home, it will probably be a good fit.

My one main issue with this laptop is the sound - loudness and quality is terrible! If you plan on watching videos or playing music, you will need an external sound system to bump up the volume (or headphones).

Also good to know about is the internal microphone - I didn't realize that there was one (and that I wouldn't need to set anything up for it), and it sure came in handy when I installed my Rosetta Stone programs and was able to do the pronunciation parts just by talking in a regular voice - microphone really picks up the sound.","['laptop desktop life laptop lot research', 'asus ij inch model price', 'laptop good size look', 'super thin ultra', 'light laptop', 'macbook air product look', 'dependable quality laptop usage', 'good fit main issue laptop', 'sound loudness quality terrible plan', 'video play music need external', 'sound system bump volume headphone good', 'internal microphone', 'handy instal rosetta stone program', 'able pronunciation part talk', 'regular voice microphone']"
"For the price I think this laptop is pretty decent.  You get all the bells and whistles you could possibly want for only a hundred dollars more than the older model without a blue-ray player, not as good graphics card, less memory, etc.

My only complaint is with the touchpad, although this complaint can cause some headaches.  First off the location and style of the touch pad is pretty bad.  Because it isn't a different color from the rest of the case and the indentation is not very deep, its really easy to not truely know your on it unless you actively concentrate on where your finger is, so it's a lot less natural than other touch pads.  Secondly the location is horrible.  When I type with the keyboard i fairly often bump the touchpad with my left-hand palm, which causes the mouse to click occasionally.  If I'm in a word processor or web browser this can be extremely aggravating as I can change web pages or where I am typing if the cursor is at those areas.

Thirdly, either the software or the sensor is not the greatest.  About 10% of the time my clicks don't register or moving across the screen registers as a click.  I'm hoping once i get time to find any updated drivers for the touchpad (whose website I tried but wasn't working when I looked this weekend) will fix this, otherwise it's gonna be a long 4 years before I get a new computer.

UPDATE:  After a little over a year old, this laptop's graphics card started failing, and this caused a month+ long odyssy to get it fixed by ASUS under warrenty.  Because of this debacle, I will never by an ASUS product again. Read more below.

This experience report isn't about this exact model, but a similar one for which I have had a terrible experience with ASUS technical support, and so potential buyers of any ASUS computer should be well-aware in order to know what their experience might be. The summary is for a simple bad graphics card (under warranty), getting the computer back in working condition involved a 5-week ordeal, 6 emails to them, 5 phone calls, misleading information almost making me pay for repairs, and them wiping my hard drive in my opinion unnecessarily. All this means I will never buy an ASUS laptop again, and you shouldn't either. For the details, read on.

About 7 months ago, I started noticing a flicker of the laptop's screen about 1 time a day. I emailed ASUS tech support using their message center about it, and asked what I should do.

"I bought this so I could use a laptop when I'm away from my desktop.  It was one of the few really small, affordable laptop computers that runs Win 7 Professional, which I need for access to my employer's network.  It's no speed demon, and the hard drive is a bit smaller than I would like, but it works.  What I discovered is that the computer works well enough that I use it at home more than I expected.  If I want to browse the web or do email or do simple picture editing I can carry the ASUS into a quiet part of the house and work in peace.
The build quality is good, though this is not an industrial strength device that will take a huge beating.  I don't know if the keyboard would hold up to long hours of daily use.  This notebook PC probably won't take the place of your desktop but it works well.  Mine has been reliable so far.  The only real complaints so far:  The short/wide screen is not ideal for viewing some web pages, and the small screen yields fairly small text size on many pages.

"This laptop is snappy and solid.  Feels good to use and is a generally great laptop.  The only problem I had was one that not many people will run into: I needed to hook an extra large monitor to the external VGA port.  I did so, and it would not recognize the PNP monitor as a PNP monitor, but instead labeled it as NON-PNP Generic.  This limits the resolutions available to the monitor.  I tried several different monitors (normal sized and large, and they all had the same result.  None of them registered as plug and play.
I contacted ASUS, as this was clearly an OS or Hardware issue, both of which would fall under their abilities to fix.  They told me that the large monitor was outside what the driver supported.  This was clearly incorrect as the issue had nothing to do with the size of the monitor (as proven by using smaller monitors).  The first tech used every excuse he could think of not to work on the system including saying that the support of this laptop's hardware was not their problem.  At this point I asked that the problem be escalated or that I could talk to his manager.  He would do neither, but suggested that I call back and talk to someone else.  I did.
The next tech looked over the notes left by the other tech and said that he was not able to escalate the call either as the criteria did not match the requirements for escalations in their system.  A little more honest.  He did say, however, that if I sent the laptop back to them that they would take a look at this and get it resolved.  I needed the laptop for that weekend, but at least he finally supplied me a path to resolution.  The second tech was more pleasant, and slightly more helpful, but generally felt like he had his hands tied.
The ASUS support was not what I have come to expect from professional support from other vendors.
Their product might be great, but I would not recommend their product due their support.","['laptop snappy', 'good use', 'great laptop problem people', 'need hook', 'extra large monitor external vga port', 'pnp monitor pnp monitor', 'label non pnp generic limit resolution', 'available monitor', 'different monitor', 'large result register plug play contact asus', 'os hardware issue fall ability fix', 'large monitor', 'driver support', 'incorrect issue size monitor', 'small monitor tech excuse', 'work system', 'support laptop hardware problem point', 'problem escalate talk manager', 'tech look note', 'able escalate criterion', 'requirement escalation system', 'laptop look', 'need laptop weekend', 'path resolution', 'tech pleasant', 'hand tie asus support', 'professional support vendor product', 'product support']"
"Plain and simple, I love this computer. It is exactly what I was looking for. The size and convenience are ideal for at home use as well as travel. I chose this particular model based on word of mouth and written reviews. Of particular importance to me were battery life, processor speed, wireless n, and quality of construction (particularly the keyboard). I have been very pleased so far. I can charge the computer at night and get a full day out of it with what I consider average-frequent use.

Initially, I was very hesitant about Windows 7 Starter. I know people have mixed feelings about it, but I really like it. I have yet to encounter the 3 program limit some reviewers have cited. I also want to note that Asus includes their own software that allows customization of the background wallpaper despite the fact that Windows 7 Starter doesn't allow that on its own.

I like the pink and white design. I know that this is a computer and NOT an accessory, but given the choice of color, I enjoyed choosing something unique and fun. The white is very nice and the pink is just subtle enough. This particular one also has a finish that appears to be more resistant to fingerprints than some of the other colors, for what it's worth.

I purchased this netbook because my husband and my best friend both have Asus netbooks and love them. I originally purchased a different but newer Asus model at a different vendor and ultimately returned it because the keyboard felt extremely cheap. Although I wasn't thrilled with that model, I think Asus makes great products and I decided I wanted to stay with this brand--I am so glad I did! Whether you decide on this one or not, I would encourage netbook buyers to look at the many different netbooks Asus offers.","['size convenience', 'ideal home use travel', 'particular model base word mouth', 'particular importance battery life processor speed wireless quality construction', 'charge computer night day', 'frequent use', 'hesitant windows starter', 'encounter program limit reviewer cite', 'note asus', 'customization background wallpaper', 'fact windows starter', 'pink white design', 'computer accessory', 'choice color', 'unique fun', 'white nice pink subtle', 'particular finish', 'resistant fingerprint color', 'worth purchase netbook husband good friend asus netbook', 'different new asus model', 'different vendor', 'return keyboard', 'great product', 'netbook buyer look', 'different netbook asus']"
"I have had dozens of desktops and laptops going way back to my IBM PC25, 1984. Just like any other products you get what you pay for. There are netbooks that out of the box will cost you $700 to $900, but you selected a product in the high $200 to low $300 range. And for that price this is one very nice netbook. The Atom N280 is a couple of generations old now, but very adequate. Just like any computer when you buy on the cheap you will find the performance isn't up to expectations of the higher priced system you didn't want to pay for. How many of us hated the speed of our desktop or laptop until we upgraded the RAM, and then Wow it was great. So if you want faster and more features, well go spend more for those features and find the notebook that matches up. On this system I went to 2 GB of RAM and upgraded to Windows 7 Home Premium, since I had several Win7 upgrades that were offered last year at $49 here on Amazon. I have Office 2007 and a lot of other software that is also on my Laptop and desktop and it all works great. I sync all my files on all my systems so the software is mirrored on the notebook just like the other systems. I also have a newer HP 210-1090NR with an Atom N450 1.66. The HP has 1 GB of RAM and cannot be upgraded to 2 GB no matter what operating system you have.  Side by side this 1005HA-MU17 and the HP are equally as fast when I run identical tasks or programs at the same time on both.  The HP cost me $180 more than the 1005HA-MU17.

"I just spent 52 infuriating minutes on the phone with three successive levels of Asus customer service representatives.  At the end, I'm left with a $330 paperweight, formerly my Eee PC Seashell 1005HA netbook.

I bought it from Amazon on August 13 2009 and used it for four months, until December 30, when the power adapter failed, leaving me with no way to charge the device or receive power from the line cord.  I called Asus tech support, and, following their advice, brought it back to life by plugging and unplugging the brick from the line several times.  Yesterday, March 1 2010, the adapter stopped working again, but I couldn't resuscitate it this time.  When I called Asus tech support, they had no other solution and, incredibly, told me that since the six-month warranty had expired 15 days before, no further service could be provided.  This was insulting on two counts: most reputable manufacturers honor their warranties for a reasonable extended grace period and, in any case, it was a recurrence of a problem that I had first reported well within the warranty period.  I could only believe that the representative was unfamiliar with company policies for such a situation, so I asked her to pass me up to her supervisor.  Same refusal.  I asked for the next-level supervisor.  Same refusal, except that this supervisor agreed to convey my case to yet another office, with no promise of any reply.

I see today that Amazon sells the appropriate adapter for $16.50.  I'm incredulous that for this petty price Asus is willing to sacrifice a previously happy customer and endure the word-of-mouth consequences.

"I have been using this netbook regularly for the past 9 years. I originally purchased the device for its size and portability, but found that it didn't really have the horsepower to keep up with Windows 7 (Starter Edition). After several months, I chose to upgrade the system RAM from 1GB to 2GB, which definitely helped, but it was still pretty laggy, especially when surfing the web. After several years of so-so performance I installed Linux Mint 17 (now 18) on the machine and boy what a difference that made. The netbook went from being a machine that I kept in the bag most of the time to becoming my daily driver. The sluggish, laggy performance with Windows 7 was replaced with snappy, responsive performance that, in conjunction with the small form factor, made the netbook an ideal on-the-go device. I can safely say 9 years after my original purchase that the machine is significantly faster today running Linux Mint than it was when brand new running Windows 7 Starter. My wife and I own a multi-million dollar IT services company, and this netbook has been serving as my primary business ""laptop"""" for the past 5 years.

"Asus nearly has the netbook PC perfected.  The size and ergonomics of this keyboard are bar none the best among netbooks today.  The wide touchpad has the right level of sensitivity as well. And Windows 7, even with the entry level Starter edition, offers much faster processing & bootup times than Windows XP does on the Intel Atom N270 processor.

However, the Asus Eee 1005HA has its achilles heel in mechanical design.  The 250GB HDD has undamped vibrations that pass throughout the chassis and straight into your wrists.  The fan also runs excessively.  The combination creates high levels of noise and vibration compared to similar netbooks such as the Acer Aspire One D250.  Also, even without Anti-Virus software running, Windows 7 and the preloaded software consume 40% of the available 1GB of memory.

Asus will undoubtedly be working out the kinks in this netbook, but many users will find the vibration and noise levels to be unacceptable, especially when other manufacturers offer netbooks without these concerns.  Once Asus releases a thermally cool, vibrationless version with 2GB DDR2 memory, this netbook will be unstoppable.

Update:  after exchanging for a second 1005HA, it has the exact same vibration issues.

"I got this Netbook on Monday from Amazon and from the time I opened the box the poor thing has been in constant use.

I bought this to replace my extra heavy Laptop which i got fed-up of carrying around.

This Netbook is small, light and extremely portable.

I use it all day at school and the battery life is really good (way better than my laptop that gives me 15 minutes of battery power)

Its Wi-Fi connectivity is excellent.

The screen size is good and the keyboard is nice and sturdy.

Setup is a breeze even a kid can do it

It comes with crappy Windows 7 Starter but I upgraded it to Windows 7 Home Premium the same day i got it.

I have customized the setting to my taste and it works really good.

It is a great addition to your PC arsenal if you need something nice and portable.

I am loving my brand new asset, it is a depreciating asset but an asset nevertheless.

But I have only had it for four days, so lets see if this review stays positive  ;-)","['netbook monday amazon time', 'open box', 'poor thing', 'constant use', 'extra heavy laptop', 'small light', 'portable use day school battery life good way', 'minute battery power wi fi connectivity', 'excellent screen size good keyboard', 'nice sturdy setup breeze kid', 'crappy windows starter upgrade windows home premium day', 'customize setting taste work good', 'great addition pc arsenal need', 'new asset depreciate asset asset day', 'review stay']"
"I bought this computer to take with me out of state to police school.  I was not happy with Windows Starter so I upgraded to the next level.  BAD move.  I then put on Office 7, word, excel and powerpoint....ANOTHER BAD MOVE.  After about 10 days of the computer working fine,  on the 11th day I opened my screen to Skype, and the screen was in a constant roll and was fading in and out.  I tried to reboot and took battery out etc...  Still no answer to the problem.
I called tech support THE BIGGEST BAD MOVE I made except for buying this computer!  The person on the other end (not of this country) was rude, unhelpful and just plain a sarcastic female dog.  She walked me through everything I did before calling her and was speaking down to me like I was a child, even after I explained to her that I did everything she is telling me.  Finally after 45 minutes of her crap, she told me I would have to send the computer in so that they can fix the computer because I must be doing something wrong.  I sent the computer back to Asus, had to pay for my s/h and then finally got the computer back 15 days from when I sent it.
Needless to say, I am selling this peice of junk and will NEVER do businss with Asus again.  Even though they have one of the longest warranties in the industry, it does help if you have a jerk on the other end.
Come to find out....you SHOULD NOT upgrade the Windows Starter on the netbooks because it uses too much memory for the chip and you should not install Office 7 either.  Would have been nice if someone would have told me this PRIOR to my purchase.  Now I am out of $284!!!","['computer state police school', 'happy windows starter upgrade level', 'bad office word excel powerpoint', 'bad day computer work', 'fine th day', 'open screen skype screen', 'constant roll fade', 'battery etc', 'tech support', 'computer person end country rude unhelpful', 'plain sarcastic female dog walk', 'minute crap', 'computer fix computer', 'computer asus', 'computer day', 'peice junk businss asus', 'long warranty industry', 'jerk end', 'upgrade windows starter netbook use memory chip install office']"
"The Bad: Windows 7 Starter SUCKS! Speakers SUCK (but headphones are good)! Lack of Bluetooth +/-. Reported battery life - not quite the stated 8.5 hours, but still excellent at about 6.

The Good: Nice HD capacity (250GB).  Good screen (esp. if u use Chrome).  Enough guts to use OO.o.  Works well with Win XP.  One-button touchpad on/off NICE!!!  Full-sized right SHIFT key (with reconfigured arrow keys) NICE!!! ASUS software package is good.

The Verdict: I bought this netbook as a replacement for my other ASUS netbook (1001 I think) with a 40GB SSD.  I loved the earlier netbook but the storage capacity wasn't enough. When I installed CPU intensive applications (e.g. 120 years of National Geographic on DVD run from the HD) the CPU found itself in the Everglades.  However, this netbook is everything I need in a lightweight computer with good storage capacity, connectivity, office suite compatibility and speed, screen size, keyboard layout, portability, and overall ease of use.  THIS NETBOOK IS NOT A REPLACEMENT FOR A DESKTOP COMPUTER OR A MUSCULAR LAPTOP.

Thus, if you have a copy of XP handy or are Linux competent and have a pair of headphones handy, this IS your lightweight machine.

P.S.  I believe I've had this netbook for about a year or so and have definitely put it through some paces.

2/17/2018 - I still use this hunk of cheese as a portable Internet surfer and as a storage device because it is still faster than the cloud.

"Well, I live in Brazil and I just bought this (3 weeks ago) and everything is OK... The netbook is beautiful, light weight and very handy but from the first moment till now I have a terrible noise on de left speaker... sounds like a radio without station. I can't change on Amazon because I bought in US and the Brazilian ASUS support doesn't want to help me. :(
About the computer, it was a gift to my wife and she loved it. The battery goes long but 5 hours maximum... 8.5 as advertized, no way! Five hours is enough for us, so, we are happy with it! The keyboard is OK for her (small hands) but not so OK for my (very big hands)... the screen is to small to work all day long, so I do recommend to use as a second notebook (like us)...
The performance is OK for office and internet... but, like Michael would say, this is it!
Windows 7 started seems good for the atom270 processor but is too much for it to do more than one task at the same time, like copy lots of file and streaming a video (youtube)... so for a second notebook, not bad!
Windows 7 starter is a little poor and it doesn't have some configurations. I think if your objective is to access internet in a mall or during a traffic jam, this is the right product.","['ok netbook', 'beautiful light weight', 'handy moment till terrible noise', 'radio station', 'brazilian asus support', 'computer gift wife', 'maximum advertize way hour', 'happy keyboard ok', 'small hand ok', 'big hand screen', 'small work day', 'performance ok office internet', 'michael windows', 'good atom processor task time', 'copy lot file stream video youtube', 'bad windows starter', 'poor configuration', 'objective access internet mall traffic jam']"
"I've had this computer for at least 6 weeks now, so I have had a little bit of time to play with it. I bought it mostly for surfing the web and typing, I'm a writer so the convenience of a netbook was something I really wanted.

Overall I've loved the computer. It is small and lightweight, with a sleeve I can carry it in my purse or bookbag. The battery life is a lot better than my old laptop and the power chord is nice and long, so not a hassle to have plugged in when I'm at home. The mousepad works really well, better than some of the other ones I've seen on netbooks. I read in one of the other reviews about the vibrating and noise this computer makes, and I haven't had an issue with that at all.

There are a couple things I've noticed to be a hassle on the computer though. The mousepad buttons are sometimes hard to use, though once you get used to it they aren't so bad. When certain programs pop up, like quick info on a product from a website or iTunes, sometimes the screen can't fit it all and there is no way to scroll through. I guess a lot of programs are just made for computers with a larger screen. Windows 7 starter has a lot of limitations, but that's to be expected.

Overall this is a great netbook, especially for students or people looking to surf the web and write. We are planning to buy a desktop as a ""home base","['computer week', 'bit time play', 'surf web', 'writer convenience netbook', 'small lightweight sleeve', 'purse bookbag battery life lot', 'old laptop power chord', 'hassle plug home mousepad work', 'noise computer', 'issue couple thing notice hassle computer mousepad button', 'hard use', 'bad certain program', 'quick info product website itunes screen', 'fit way scroll guess lot program computer', 'large screen windows starter lot limitation', 'great netbook', 'student people', 'surf web', 'desktop home base']"
"I never even booted Windows on this, (though from what I understand, Asus will not refund more than six dollars of the Microsoft Tax.)

Sound and wireless worked with Fedora, Ubuntu and ArchLinux.  I also have an Asus 1000HE.  This is a bit smaller and lighter.

I give it a 4, rather than a 5, for a few reasons, most of which have been stated in other reviews.  It's a fingerprint magnet.  The jack for the power cord seems very fragile.  The touchpad, and its single bar, rather than a right and left click button, is a nuisance. In Linux at least, I can't use two finger scrolling.  The touchpad is bumpy and there's a smooth area to the right that will work for one finger scrolling.  Note that this is in Linux, I don't know how it works in Windows.

Other than that, it's a netbook.  It's small, not that powerful, but fine for browsing, reading ebooks, skype (though probably better with headphones), documents and the like.

It's pretty similar to the 1000HE, with the upside of less size and weight, plus a better keyboard (full size right hand shift key this time), but with a flimsier connector from power cord to computer and that touch pad.

I remember years ago, the Gateway Arc 200 (an ultralight--but not a netbook, it was rather expensive at the time) had the middle mouse button as a little wheel on a bar above the touchpad.  I've never seen it since, but for me, at least, it was the most convenient trackpad equivalent of a mouse button that I've used.","['boot windows', 'asus refund dollar microsoft tax', 'sound wireless work fedora ubuntu archlinux asus', 'small light reason state review fingerprint magnet jack power cord fragile touchpad single', 'click button nuisance linux use finger', 'touchpad bumpy', 'smooth area', 'work finger', 'note linux', 'work windows netbook', 'small powerful fine browse reading ebook skype', 'headphone document', 'upside size weight', 'keyboard size', 'key time flimsy connector power cord computer touch', 'gateway arc ultralight netbook', 'expensive time middle mouse button', 'convenient trackpad', 'equivalent mouse button']"
"I bought this netbook in November,  upgraded the memory to 2 gigs and upgraded the OS to Win 7 Home Premium.  I've been generally happy with the performance of the machine, the battery life and its ability to display downloaded movies from Amazon Unbox.  My big issue is that I have had intermittent charging problems.  I can't tell if the problem is the adapter or the system board. The adapter gets very hot at the tip, and the laptop gets very hot in the area where the adapter connects.  I'm talking burn your finger hot.  And sometimes the AC adapter just won't charge the thing at all.  Keep trying, a few days later it will mysteriously work.  So I called Asus technical support and went through the troubleshooting with them.  All their suggestions didn't do anything; then while the analyst had me on hold to get an RMA number, it started to work again.  Very, very strange problem.  Anyways, the netbook is on its way back to Asus (at MY expense).  I hope they can resolve the problem as I love traveling with a netbook.  I have read many reviews which leads me to believe mine is NOT an isolated incident.

I also have an Acer Aspire One netbook that I had bought for my mom.  It works just fine and the way the adapter plugs in seems to be better than the Asus.  I like the netbook solution, especially for traveling light on a plane or in the car.

Edit - 4/20/2010 - My Asus was returned to me yesterday and it appears the system board was replaced.  Everything seems to be working much better and I am happy at the moment.  Also, I have compared the Asus display to the Acer display and the Asus is much brighter and easier to view.  Those of you with charging problems - I recommend sending the unit back to Asus and recommend they change the system board.","['netbook november upgrade memory gig upgrade os', 'happy performance machine battery life ability display download movie amazon unbox', 'big issue intermittent', 'problem adapter system board adapter', 'hot tip laptop', 'hot area adapter', 'burn finger', 'hot ac adapter', 'charge thing', 'technical support', 'suggestion analyst hold rma number', 'strange problem anyways netbook way asus expense hope', 'travel netbook', 'review lead', 'incident acer aspire netbook', 'mom work', 'fine way adapter plug', 'netbook solution', 'light plane car edit asus return', 'system board', 'happy moment', 'asus display acer display asus', 'bright easy view charge problem', 'unit asus', 'system board']"
"Unfortunately, I bought this netbook as an impulse buy (the husband's computer died, and he took over my Mac Mini). Therefore, I didn't do as much research as I should have. Overall, it's a nice little machine for its price. The things you need to look out for are:

1. Operating System - this machine has Windows 7 Starter, which is pretty much Microsoft's concilliatory gesture to the manufacturers to keep their costs down. How? By getting rid of features and passing the cost down to us.

2. Display - the highest resolution you can get is 1024x600. Rumor has it you can tweak it to a higher resolution. However, if you're not comfortable with playing with drivers, the shorter display size might annoy you. Many programs and sites, like Yahoo! Mail, require 1024x768 for optimum performance.

3. Bluetooth - I thought this model had it, but I see no sign of it. There are different sub-models to the 1005HA, so double-check!

4. Single trackpad button - a bit annoying, if you're not used to it. I get around it by sacrificing one of my USB slots for a mouse.

Other than those annoyances, I am impressed with this little machine. Upgrading to 2GB of RAM makes it even smoother. For those of you unfamiliar with changing memory, there are YouTube videos that demonstrate the process. The keyboard is also nice and large, for a netbook.

In short, this is a decent machine for its price and for light use.

UPDATE: 2/2/10:
By Jan 28, I had figured out how to get pseudo 1240x780 resolution (it involves downloading Windows XP VGA drivers from ASUS and choosing the options to run them with XP compatibility). I took it for its first outside run on Jan 29. It lasted a good 3-4 hours, with only 1/2 the battery power used. However, once I got it home, the display would not show. My husband and I disconnected and reconnected the battery. The display cam up, but with a bunch of vertical lines. I am in the midst of exchanging with Amazon, and I hope the replacement machine does not do the same as the original.","['netbook impulse', 'husband computer', 'mac mini research overall', 'nice little machine price thing need look', 'system machine windows starter', 'pretty microsoft concilliatory gesture manufacturer cost', 'cost display high resolution rumor tweak high resolution', 'comfortable play driver', 'short display size annoy program site', 'optimum performance bluetooth', 'different sub model', 'double check single trackpad button bit', 'sacrifice usb slot mouse annoyance', 'machine upgrade gb ram', 'memory youtube video', 'process keyboard', 'nice large netbook', 'short decent machine price', 'light use update jan figure pseudo resolution', 'download windows xp vga driver asus', 'option run xp compatibility', 'run jan', 'good hour battery power', 'husband disconnect reconnecte battery display cam bunch vertical line midst exchange amazon hope replacement machine']"
"I am writing this review because I was agonizing over buying this and I couldn't find any reviews on it, which usually is not a good thing. It's been about two weeks of heavy use and I plan on updating this as time goes on. First, I searched for about two months and considered  every conceivable configuration of laptop trying to find what I wanted. I concluded I wanted a light 12.1 inch laptop with an optical drive that had decent speed and battery life. I was fairly certain that configuration didn't exist and was about to buy the ul30 without the optical drive, when I stumbled on this bad boy.

Pros:

SIZE!! I really think this is the perfect size form factor for anyone who has to carry a computer on a daily basis; not so thin I am afraid I will snap it in half but not so think and heavy I break my arm carrying it to work (my old laptop was 6 lbs and this one is 4, soooo much better). It's about the size of two or three magazines stacked on top of each other. It slips right in my briefcase and I hardly notice it.  The screen size is actually more than big enough, I absolutely love the size of this thing.

ASUS backing their product - ASUS offers a free 2 full years of warranty on this product plus a free year of accidental damage coverage. To buy this for an apple costs $200 at least. I know they're good for it because they offered to fix my computer when I had an issue (see support)

Light up keyboard - this wasn't even on my radar but now that I have it it's probably my favorite feature. It just looks good. I can type with ease at night while I'm watching TV or any dim light situation. You might think you wouldn't use it but I was surprised by how convenient it is. Also, when it's bright it automatically shuts itself off to save battery. I read a lot about this ""keyboard flex"""" issue.  I now see what people were talking about. There is a liner/spacer cutout which lays between the keys","['review agonize', 'good thing week', 'heavy use plan update time', 'search month', 'conceivable configuration laptop', 'light inch laptop optical drive', 'decent speed battery life', 'certain configuration', 'ul optical drive stumble', 'bad boy', 'pro size', 'perfect size form factor', 'thin afraid snap', 'old laptop lbs soooo', 'size magazine stack slip', 'notice screen size', 'size thing asus', 'product asus', 'free year warranty product', 'free year accidental damage coverage', 'apple cost', 'fix computer issue support', 'light keyboard radar', 'good type', 'tv dim', 'light situation', 'lot keyboard', 'issue people', 'liner spacer cutout', 'lay key']"
"This laptop is slick.  I purchased this to replace a failing four year old Macbook.  With a battery life of around eleven hours in a low power mode, the laptop is ultra-portable.  Kicking into a higher performance mode takes a few seconds and leaves you with a little under half of the maximum battery life.  The touchpad is a bit unconventional and I'm still getting used to it.  It is completely level with the surface of the laptop and I have found my fingers like to wander off the edges of the usable area.  The instant-on splashtop was a nice surprise.  I wasn't even aware of the functionality when I purchased the computer.  The applications are very basic and the music player rates pretty low on the intuitive features list but it does play music after you have your playlists set up.  Though it is fairly big, it's just as thin and lightweight. I don't plan to do any serious gaming on the computer, but I do play EVE.  It ran quite well with the G210M on.  I have only had this product for about a day but so far I'm very happy with it.","['laptop slick purchase', 'old macbook battery life hour', 'low power mode laptop ultra', 'portable kick high performance mode', 'maximum battery life touchpad bit', 'level surface laptop', 'wander edge', 'usable area instant splashtop', 'nice surprise', 'aware functionality purchase computer application', 'basic music player rate', 'pretty low intuitive', 'list play music playlist', 'big thin lightweight plan', 'computer play eve run product day']"
"I give only 3 stars to this laptop because it uses a cheap processor.

The Intel T6600 processor costs less, which is why laptops with this type of CPU cost less, but that is at the expense of some pretty important features.

The biggest problem is that this laptop's CPU does not support Hardware Assisted Virtualization (VT). This means you cant use the XP mode offered by Windows 7 Ultimate. You cant run VM's on the majority of Virtualization products (VMWARE, VirtualPC).

There is a workaround for XP mode by using VMLite, but this is the single biggest weak point of this laptop.

Otherwise I find it ok. Returning this laptop for lack of VT means Amazon will charge their usual 15% restocking fee and its not worth that.

My advise is that if you are a serious user who likes advanced features, look around for a laptop with a better processor. If you are looking for a cheap system with reasonable specs then choose this.

You will never be able to enjoy Win 7 Ultimate (with all its features) on this laptop. Caveat Emptor.","['star laptop use', 'cheap processor intel processor cost laptop type cpu cost expense', 'big problem laptop cpu support hardware', 'virtualization vt', 'xp mode', 'vm majority virtualization product vmware virtualpc workaround xp mode vmlite single', 'big weak point laptop', 'ok return laptop lack vt', 'amazon charge', 'worth advise user', 'processor look', 'cheap system', 'reasonable spec', 'laptop caveat emptor']"
"Very good value considering features and price. Was looking for a notebook with 13.3in screen and CD/DVD Player. Couldn't find anything 13.3in with CD/DVD player at reasonable price but at 14in the Asus comes pretty close. Has bluetooth, HDMI, Wireless a/b/g/n and 2.2GHZ cpu, lighted keyboard and multitouch touchpad, all good to have besides the usual base feature set.

Appears too glossy for me and certainly a fingerprint magnet. The mousepad could have been better designed. It's a little bit too small and the clicker feels awkward, but I guess I might get used to it soon. The screen looks very good but the default setup was a little too bright so I adjusted it down a little.

Runs pretty cool and reasonably quiet. Compared side by side with a Sony VGN-SR390 13.3in and I liked the looks of the Sony better. But the U80V is about 500.00 cheaper and the Sony's keyboard is not lighted. I choose the ASUS for features and value but honestly my heart was with the Sony. :-)

Even though advertised as thin, the ASUS is not that thin at about 1.3 in, but comfortable to sit on my laptop and type while watching TV.

Overall, great value!","['good value', 'price look notebook screen cd dvd player', 'cd dvd player', 'reasonable price asus', 'bluetooth hdmi wireless ghz cpu', 'light keyboard multitouch touchpad good', 'usual base', 'fingerprint magnet mousepad', 'small clicker', 'awkward guess', 'screen look good default setup', 'sony vgn sr', 'cheap sony keyboard', 'heart sony advertise', 'thin asus', 'laptop type', 'tv overall', 'great value']"
"For the past few months, I was looking to replace my old Acer laptop with a new one. I was attracted by ASUS because of their Global Two year warranty and One Year accidental damage. I was looking for a laptop that offers
- Decent Battery Life
- Is under 5 lbs
- 14 inch screen which I think is ideal for desktop replacement at home and also easy to carry around
- Backlit Keyboard
- Dedicated Graphics.

I tried two similar laptops but now finally decided to stay with this U80V-B2. The other laptop that were on my list were Toshiba E205 and ASUS UL80.

Toshiba E205 -
 I first tried New TOshiba E205 which is recently launched at BestBuy. ALthough E205 has backlit keyboard, slot loading DVD drive and the new Core- i5 processor, I decided to return that beacause- It would get quite warm on the keyboard and touchpad which is rare among ASUS laptops that I have tried. The palm rest of E205 was kinda small and uncomfortable. IT was also not as snappy as I expected although it featured new Core-i5 processor.

ASUS UL80-
Although the UL80 has a slim profile with brushed Aluminium lid, featured a Core 2 DUO processor, has rated 8 hrs real life battery life, I missed a backlit keyboard and Bluetooth. The ULV processor was not smooth for some heavy multitasking and the touch pad was a disaster.

Finally I decided that U80V-B2, which is infact a older model than UL80, would best suit my needs at least based on its specification. When I saw its price came down to $ 699 at amazon, I decided to buy it and got it just yesterday. So far I am pretty much impressed with it for the value i paid for it.

The touch pad is a breeze to use, although its located more towards the right and not in center. The multi-touch features work great. The back-lit keayboard is also awesome since you can adjust the brightness. It has bluetooth so that I have been able to syncronize my cell-phone and use my bluetooth wireless mouse. The laptop remains super cool after a prolong use also and is very quiet. I have been able to get 5 hours battery life on Battery saving mode which is not bad for a 6-cell battery. Overall, its the most efficiently made laptop i have ever tried. You can find more expensive laptops out there, but this laptop gives you back the every penny you invested with features no other laptop gives at that price.

"Simple personal feeling about this Asus UX30

The Good side

1. Good CPU speed, I'm a student using the laptop mainly for homework/study/web/movies/youtube. It's not a lighting speed one but I'm totally happy with it's performance --- no lag! I think the 4GB ram definitely help.

2. Super thin and sleek outlook and excellent built quality. Asus built the laptop with brushed aluminum on the top and high-end plastic on the bottom, which make it feels like you are holding a $1xxx latop :D,

3. Surprise how light the latop is, I can spin it with my finger! no kidding~ Also the power adapter is the smallest I've ever seen, the adapter is about the length of a lighter and 3 times of it's size and super light as well.

4. Crispy screen playing 1080p video smoothly, No problem using HDMI output on 56inches TV.

5. I think a lot of people would concern about the battery life, well, I can honestly tell you it's really not that bad, for normal web browsing it can last 4.5hrs using the battery saving mode, and don't be scared by hearing battery saving equal to low performance, in fact I just feel the same as the high performance mode except using dimmer screen brightness. The battery is in fact a high end POLYMER battery instead of standard one on other laptops, it's more reliable and has longer life.

6. Asus Express Gate installed. EG let you get on internet do most stuff without booting the windows, it's Linux based os customized for Asus laptop. As advertised get connected online and start browsing the web in 8 Sec (tested, takes 6sec! ^^)

6. Elegant package make you feeling like unboxing a macbook air ^^

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

The Bad side

1. Weak microphone, I use the video chat on Skype and live messenger a lot, the microphone just doesn't useful as the one who you chat with couldn't hear any but noise from you. Disappointed. Problem Solved by bought a usb audio interface for $9.99, it work perfectly now.

2. It would be a little tough to get used to the touch pad, but in few days, you'll be OK and enjoy, still cant compare to Mac's touch pad.

Overall, it's a great value to purchase this notebook, I'm happy using it everyday in school and home. everything just great. Highly recommended for student or people who love to use their laptop the way I do, Web browsing/homework/movies/Youtube/video chat/

"I expended several weeks looking for the right computer for my needs and this was the perfect laptop. I did not wanted to make the same mistake that I made the last time by buying an underpowered pc. This ASUS N61JQ-A1 has a lot of power and it is a beautiful system.  Something that I was concern about when I bough it on-line was the color. On line is described as being a dark brown. It is dark brown but it is so dark that it looks black and in addition the pattern in the design is awesome. I bough mine at Costco on-line because they offer the best return policy that I know of and they had the best price I could find. I was tented to buy the ASUS G51 which has almost the same components and in addition better resolution for a bit more money but I am glad I pick the N61JQ-A1 because of the elegant look. The G51's design is just not cut out for the work environment because of its extravagant looks. The good thing is that the screen resolution has not been an issue for me when I play some games. This is a one for all laptop because it can be used for almost everything and is a very nice machine.

"The N61JQ-X1, simply put, is a great laptop...

Pros:
Blazing speed - and this only w/ 4 gig of RAM... (granted, I'm leaving an early core duo, so... it's more Honda to Porsche, not Porsche to Ferrari).
Windows 7, 64 bit (I put the bar on the left, and it changes the game...)
Great screen
Great graphics card (high 2nd tier, but I'm not a gamer, so who cares... and directv plays great on it (just got whole home from them, and it streams my dvr).
very good sound (although I don't use it much)
NUMBER KEYPAD!!! I used to hate typing numbers on laptops - no more!
HUGE screen - yet fairly light
Not very hot- no more burned wrists (although it is quite hot back towards the screen... so watch your laps!!!)
and... last... but not least!!!!

IT IS CHEAP (for what it is)... I tried to buy it here, but thought about it too long, and missed the half a C-note under a G, but was still in time for the end of cashback from MS - I sure will miss that program.

Cons:
ASUS bloatware - easily remedied
awkward placement of power plug - I like laying the laptop down on it's side - and this doesn't allow me to.
as others have noted - it will be covered with fingerprints... again- who cares.
Wireless N is single band (only 2.4, no 5ghz)

All in all - I could not be more pleased...
Granted - it's only a week in, so much left to see, but overall, I don't regret leaving my many year long, abusive relationship with D@ll... oddly enough - rhymes with h@ll!  If only my work would change too!!!

"Ill start with the cons first;
  -relatively low resolution screen (1366x768)
  -small hard drive (320gb)which is partitioned into a local os and a data segment (with a small hidden partition for recovery)
  -webcam is relatively worthless
  -bloatware (useless programs that come installed on the laptop)
  -runs rather hot but I knew this would be the case
  -short batterlife, but again, I knew this going in
  -only 3 usb ports (usb 3.0 port = backwards compatible)

now the pros
  -awesome graphics card, the 5730, which supports directx 11, and at the given resolution it can support most games on relatively high settings. (remember, we'r talking about a laptop)
  -core i7 720q; great mobile processor. very capable, its debatable whether or not your better off going with this or an good i5 processor, but it depends what your doing. since I wanted to do mobile 3d modeling and animation, I went with the quad core. the laptop is surprisingly only a fraction slower than my desktop, which is a core i7 950 overclocked w 2 gb more ram.
  -usb 3.0 + card reader + hdmi + eSATA + bluetooth and more = :)

I would suggest this laptop to anyone. Its fast and capable, and is a suitable solution to my needs. for a quad core processor, and a capable graphics card, most comparable laptops are hundreds more. The only things Im still unhappy with is all the bloatware; it must be newer stuff because I still cant find solid reviews on what I can delete without crippling something. Also, whatever genius decided they needed to partition the hard drive needs to be found and put on an island somewhere where he can do no more damage. with 320gb of hard drive, I would much rather prefer having it all in one place. This is of course fixable with some freeware offline, and if I had more experience with that, I would have fixed the partitions, but I dont, so I didnt. Ill probably just hook up a terabyte hard drive to the esata port eventually anyways, so im not worried. all in all, laptop is a good deal, but for the specs, there are definitely some aspects being sacrificed. (oh and I dont know why they havent figured out yet that I (and most geeks like me) have oily hands. quit making laptops shiny fingerprint magnets!)

Update (7/1/2013)
Its been just over 3 years since I bought this laptop. Its been a fantastic tool. I've reinstalled windows on it a handful of times, and changed out the hdd, and upgraded the ram. just a few months ago I took the whole thing apart to clean out the vents. It's a trooper and is still going strong.","['resolution screen', 'small hard drive gb', 'partition local os data segment', 'partition recovery webcam', 'worthless bloatware', 'useless program', 'instal laptop run', 'short batterlife', 'usb port usb port backwards compatible', 'pro awesome graphic card support directx', 'resolution support game', 'high setting', 'laptop core', 'great mobile processor', 'good processor', 'quad core laptop', 'slow desktop core overclocke gb ram usb card reader hdmi esata bluetooth', 'fast capable suitable solution need quad core processor', 'capable graphic card', 'comparable laptop', 'unhappy bloatware', 'new stuff', 'solid review delete cripple genius', 'need partition', 'hard drive need', 'island damage gb', 'hard drive', 'place course', 'fixable freeware offline experience fix partition', 'hook terabyte', 'hard drive esata port', 'laptop good', 'aspect sacrifice oh', 'figure geek', 'shiny fingerprint magnet update year', 'fantastic tool reinstall window handful time', 'hdd upgrade ram month', 'clean vent trooper']"
"I've had this laptop for just over 2 years now, and I have to say, I'm impressed. It has a couple quirks, but for what I payed for it, it's a champ, any issues I had with it I've been able to resolve myself, first off, I'll list the cons that I've run into in my 2 years of laptop ownership.

CONS:
1. HEAT - This laptop is by no means a lightweight, this is a desktop replacement, boasting a beefy i7 processor that runs standard at 1.6 GHz, and goes up as needed to 2.2. That means this thing pumps out quite a bit of heat, idling usually around 60 degrees Celsius, going up to 85 under max load. That being said, the cooling system used is very efficient, as long as you keep the fan clear (easily reached through the bottom panel) and don't block the port, you won't have issues with it. Not once during the time I've had this laptop has it overheated, through basic use, through Minecraft, Mass Effect, Just Cause, and pretty much anything else I've thrown at it.

2. HARD DRIVE - Just about a year after I got the laptop, the hard drive died in a spectacular crash during use, but as a 320G drive is barely passable these days, not a big issue for me. The issue actually came up after I popped in the nice and roomy new 750GB drive, where a number of windows functions didn't appear to work. This was resolved simply by reinstalling the Intel Storage Utility, as the driver in the laptop didn't fully support drives that large.

3. BSOD - This guy had me stumped for a good long time, randomly during use, I would get a Blue Screen directed towards the USB 3.0 Driver crashing, fiddling with the bios, reformatting, and trying different drivers did nothing, so I chalked it up to a hardware issue UNTIL I discovered that the problem was easily fixable in windows settings. Turns out the 3.0 port doesn't like being put on standby to save power, so just switching all the settings in device manager to not allow windows to do that fixed all problems.

So, in summary, for the cons, Keep your exhaust port clean and open, Intel Storage Utility for big drives, and power settings for the USB ports in Device Manager. Do this and you'll be as happy as a clam with this laptop.

The nicest thing I note about this laptop is that it has room to grow, you don't pay through the nose up front for easy upgrades you can make later. Hard Drive? A little small, but it's a standard, just pop in a new one, takes maybe 5 minutes, same with the RAM, starts at 4, and  goes up to 8 whenever you feel like it.","['laptop year', 'couple quirk pay champ issue', 'con run year laptop ownership cons heat laptop', 'lightweight desktop replacement', 'beefy processor run', 'standard ghz', 'thing pump bit heat', 'degree celsius', 'max load', 'cool system', 'panel block port', 'issue time laptop overheat', 'basic use minecraft mass effect', 'drive year', 'hard drive', 'spectacular crash use drive', 'passable day', 'big issue issue', 'nice roomy', 'new gb drive number window function', 'reinstall intel storage utility driver laptop', 'support drive', 'large bsod guy stump good', 'long time', 'blue screen', 'direct usb driver', 'fiddle bio reformatte', 'different driver', 'hardware issue', 'fixable window setting', 'power switch setting device manager', 'window fix problem summary', 'con exhaust port', 'clean open intel storage utility', 'big drive power setting usb port device manager', 'happy clam laptop', 'nice thing note laptop room', 'easy upgrade', 'hard drive', 'small standard', 'minute ram']"
"Decided to pull the trigger and bought this when Amazon brought the price down to $909 + free shipping.

Pros:
- i7 + 5730 + 4GB of RAM + USB 3.0 for $909 is a great value
- Quiet hard drive
- Nice feel when typing (this is my first laptop with a chiclet style keyboard)
- The dark brown cover actually looks good
- Overall system performance is superb, multitasking is a breeze and never slowed down in spite having over 20 spreadsheets open, playing a bit of Zero Hour in Windows XP mode, uTorrent downloading, and Norton getting updates
- Built-in glass screen protector
- The range of its built-in WiFi antenna is pretty good, strong connections even if the router is in our living room and I'm using this in an upstairs bedroom.

Cons:
- A bit of flex on the keyboard
- In spite of its multimedia bias, the speakers are woefully weak. Bought a generic version of Logitech's clip-on speakers, and it made a world of difference.
- The fan on its right side seems to be continuously blowing hot air, fortunately the laptop remains pretty quiet
- Had to update most of the devices on it as the drivers installed were already out of date (BIOS, Chipset, Camera, LAN, WLAN, Bluetooth, USB 3 port, ATI Catalyst, Hotkeys, HDMI Audio, etc.)

What Its Missing:
- A backlit keyboard, though there are hacks on the internet if you want to install one. Personally, I just bought a USB LED light.
- An option for higher resolution screen as this really would benefit from at least a 1920x1080 display
- An option for a 9-cell battery

No other offering from the bigger name brands comes close to this much value. I customized to the same specs and they came out hundreds of dollars more.","['pull trigger', 'free shipping', 'pro gb ram usb', 'great value', 'quiet hard drive', 'type laptop chiclet style keyboard', 'dark brown', 'good overall system performance superb multitaske breeze', 'slow spite', 'open play bit zero hour windows xp mode utorrent', 'glass screen protector range', 'wifi antenna', 'pretty good strong connection router', 'upstairs bedroom', 'con bit', 'keyboard spite multimedia bias speaker', 'generic version logitech clip speaker world difference fan', 'hot air', 'pretty quiet update device driver instal date bios chipset camera lan wlan bluetooth usb port ati catalyst hotkeys hdmi audio etc', 'backlit keyboard hack internet', 'light option high resolution screen benefit display option cell battery offering', 'big brand', 'value customize spec']"
"I recently purchased this laptop(arrived 07/28/1987) and have had a few days to play with it.

First of all I think this laptop is very nice and has a couple of nice features as many have said such as the i7, antec lansing speakers, cost, etc but what I will write about is are the cons I have personally experienced from the usage of this computer.

First off if you are buying this computer for gaming just note that the Radeon HD 5730 has many issues to many of the modern games.

Starcraft 2: It crashes very frequently on this computer. The default drivers just won't do. Upgrade the drivers to the new 10.7 catalyst drivers right away and then if you are lucky it might not crash as often. I wouldn't blame this entirely on the graphics card since Starcraft 2 is have a multitude of problems with ATI graphics cards at the moment.

Dragon Age Origins: Same with Starcraft 2 works but crashes from time to time. Make sure to upgrade your dragon age to the newest version and have the 10.7 drivers. I played this game for 5 hrs and it crashed about 3 times. ATI issues same with SC2.

Mass Effect 2: Runs very smoothly. No Problems (but have heard on many forums this game had many issues with ATI cards.)

Others:

FN key not working. Volume/Mute Keys are not working. I had this problem at first but after updated with ATK drivers they worked fine.

These are just a few of the problems I have personally encountered so far. Perhaps I just got a lemon iono, but after the updates to the drivers the problems seem to have either been fixed or lessened. In regards to the games. It might not necessarily be the notebook's fault, but just a few things to keep in mind. This was from my personal experience hopefully others are luckier and don't experience these problems.","['purchase laptop', 'day play', 'nice couple', 'antec lanse speaker cost etc', 'experience usage computer', 'note radeon hd issue', 'modern game starcraft crash', 'computer default driver', 'upgrade driver', 'new catalyst driver', 'lucky crash blame', 'graphic card starcraft multitude problem ati graphic card moment dragon age origins starcraft work crash time time', 'sure upgrade dragon age', 'new version driver play game hrs crash time ati issue sc mass effect run', 'forum game issue ati card fn key work volume mute keys work problem update atk driver work', 'fine problem', 'lemon iono update driver problem fix lessen regard game', 'notebook fault thing mind', 'personal experience', 'lucky experience problem']"
"DEFINITELY READ THIS BEFORE YOU BUY THIS LAPTOP
I have owned an asus before, was not bad (but it crashed on a video game and never started again) I figured maybe I was the cause of it. I bought another one, this one. Do not bother purchasing it. This laptop will suck your time dry. I have had numerous problems that took up many hours of online research, and phone calls, and more money.
PROBLEMS 1) Within minutes of starting my computer for the first time, I GET the BLUE screen of death. Took me awhile to figure this one out. Unfortunately my left USB port would allow a plug to go in upside down and shorted the system. NO GOOD, 2)Screen quality is junk 3) Video games are not very compatible with this laptop. Many hours fixing bugs and downloading driver updates, and patches. 4) During video games there will be a line that goes across the screen and breaks up the graphics for a split second during cinematic, but frequently and in different locations-just odd. 5)The battery life is horrible, it will say 2 hours-you will be lucky if you get 1 and half.  I thought I read somewhere that this thing got 10 hours! I looked over something there. 6)DVD drive just stopped working. I DO NO KNOW WHY. 7)only three USB ports. 8)I had to buy a recovery cd for 60 dollars!!! because the OS crashed within the 3rd month. 9)MY LEFT mouse Button on the Laptop is starting to be unresponsive-sometimes it does not select it and now I have noticed I am putting much pressure on it to get it to work. 19)The asus live update feature is a scam!! I have never downloaded a driver from it and it always says its up to date-LIARS. HOURS of finding the drives myself. Turns out that the software they offer on there website is ALSO OUT OF DATE. I had to purchase another software (driver genius) to get the right drivers. 11)POOR customer service-long wait on the phone and no one I have talked to so far speaks clear English, but that goes for HP as well. PLAIN AND SIMPLE DO NOT BUY THIS LAPTOP, ALSO DO NOT BUY A ASUS. pure junk. there are no good laptops out there anymore though.... best computer I have ever owned- VPR Matrix. It is still alive and kicking. Never had a problem with it.

"My father bought this laptop for me as a Christmas present in 2010. It is now May 2015, and I have just given this laptop away to my older brother. This laptop has been my faithful companion for well over 4 years, throughout the end of middle school and much of my High School life. This laptop is special to me, as it has been the first one I'd ever gotten that actually ran the games I wanted to play effectively (my two previous laptops were Dell notebooks and they sucked real bad at gaming).

The good things about this laptop:
1) Decent for running games made from at latest 2012 to older (portal 2, skyrim, and anything older run great). Runs smoothly and is capable of handling stressful loads (or at least I remember it being that way). I had a lot of fun times playing games using this laptop for well over 4 years. It never failed me once when it came to performance (however, read the last paragraph on my review for some clarification on how the performance is NOW in 2015).
2) WINDOWS 7. I cannot stress this enough. Even now I still consider Windows 7 to be a far superior operating system to Windows 8, 8.1 and perhaps someday even 10. It is both user-friendly but not too dumbed-down and ""metro-ified"""" as Windows 8 is. I like the GUI's smooth edges that are both futuristic but not too bubbly and drab like Windows XP was.

"ill tell you right off the bat that im not a laptop guy. so why i bought one puzzles even me. no matter what the specs i feel theyre a always a little slower and i guess im just paranoid about being careful with them, not only from my friends' bad experiences with laptops but with my own tendency for bad luck. anyway, with that said, please dont take everything i say with a grain of salt. i think i just need some time to get used to it.
a big cosmetic flaw (kinda) is the non-backlit keyboard. if you have the screen fairly vertical and just dont have the brightness all the way down its usable at night though. Im writing this in the dark and i can see, so any typos are just bad typing.
the battery life could be better, but isnt terrible for a laptop this size. gives about 2 hrs, even with switching to power save mode. the different power modes dont seem to do much except change the brightness. Altho the power save mode does de-color your windows theme and puts a stock Asus background.

**A big part of why i got this model was because it said it comes with powerdvd and power director. it technically does. i havent tried powerdvd yet, but power director is a stripped down version that wont even let you do PiP, which i need for my cover band.*

Other Cons;
-keyboard feels cheap. seems to warp/bend when you type.
-mouse does things i dont want it to, like zoom instead of scroll (again, non-laptop guy getting used to it. i also got a regular mouse with it)
-tons of Asus named software you think will be crucial and part of the system, its not. still have yet to sort out all the required from not
-IMO it somehow seems a little slower than it should be for a quad core (i7)
-the Libraries (music, pics, video) in windows 7 are stored in a 116 gb OS partition, which is already taken up by about 75 gb of junk (altho some may be drivers, so dont go nuts uninstalling)
-screen resolution isnt great either. in a previous review someone said you can just resize it with the mouse pad; that only works for webpages.
-the turbo boost doesnt seem to do much. you can see the meter revv up if you have itunes open and open IE or something. havent tried any games yet.
-only has Office starter (excel and stripped down Word)
-screen has a fair amount of glare.

Pros;
-battery charges quickly
-runs incredibly quiet and fairly cool for a laptop. loudest thing was the dvd burner revving up
-comes with Excel and Word (i dont do anything fancy in Word and rarly use PowerPoint anymore)
-big hard drive
-good sound (especially when connected to external surround sound)
-read my microSD when no other computer or external card reader would.
-the webcam is amusing to play with and put designs or accessories on yourself or change the color or what have you...
-great graphics card
-lots of ram. doesnt slow down when i have itunes and some windows open
-USB 3.0 was nice when transferring everything off my external from my desktop

Overall this computer is good, but as a video editor i dont really know why i switched to a laptop. For anyone else im sure itll work even better than it does for me. Anyone who does something other than film editing and/or who just likes to have a fast computer and alot of space for stuff, this is perfect for.","['bat laptop guy', 'matter spec', 'slow guess paranoid', 'careful friend', 'bad experience laptop tendency', 'bad luck', 'grain salt', 'need time', 'big cosmetic flaw', 'non backlit keyboard screen', 'brightness way', 'usable night', 'dark typo', 'battery life', 'terrible laptop size', 'hrs switch power', 'different power mode', 'color window theme', 'stock asus background', 'powerdvd power director', 'powerdvd power director strip version', 'pip need', 'band cons keyboard', 'cheap warp bend type mouse thing', 'scroll non laptop guy', 'regular mouse ton asus name software', 'crucial system sort', 'slow quad core', 'libraries music pic video windows store gb os partition', 'gb junk', 'screen resolution', 'great previous review', 'resize mouse', 'work webpage', 'turbo boost', 'meter revv itune', 'open open ie', 'office starter excel strip word screen fair glare', 'pro battery charge', 'cool laptop', 'loud thing dvd burner rev', 'excel word', 'fancy word', 'big hard drive good', 'external surround', 'microsd computer external card reader', 'design accessory', 'great graphic card lot ram', 'slow itune window', 'open usb', 'external desktop overall computer good video editor', 'switch laptop', 'sure ll work', 'film editing', 'fast computer alot space stuff']"
"I was happy with my purchase for less than a year, after which, the camera stopped working. The system would say that it was already in use, which it wasn't. I took it in and they reformatted the laptop and took off the hotkeys and it worked again but my features and hotkeys that were supposed to work on the computer no longer worked. After reinstalling the drivers and everything the camera stopped working again. The computer tech and myself came to the realization that Asus made the computer so that if you want all your hotkeys on the keyboard and features to work, they mess with the camera, but if you want your camera to work, you can't use your hotkeys and other features that the laptop is supposed to come with. It is a stupid issue that the company should be held responsible for but will not and have not found a fix to. I'm very sad I spent the money (around $800 at the time) on something that I cannot use all features on. Because I used the camera less often, I had to opt for the keyboard to work the way it was supposed to so I haven't had use of the camera almost since I bought the stupid machine. I will not purchase Asus brand again since the company couldn't even take the time to come up with a simple programming update to fix the issue.

"but...

This unit was a replacement for a N81VP which had issues from the get go.  I sent it in because of the severe keyboard clank and flex.  Web search for it and it's a known issue.  I was aware of the issue and was prepared to RMA the thing just because the specs were impressive.  I received the item back scratched up, hard drive cover not snapped in place properly and some extra added noise coming from the cpu area.  You would think that they would pay extra care to fix your laptop properly given the fact they clearly let down the customers expectations on quality control right?  To get a machine back in worse condition?  That's just not acceptable given what these things cost.

So the N61JQ-X1 is a nice looking machine as everyone has stated.  I was trilled when I saw the beauty of the thing when I received it and it made up (not really) for my troubles.  The screen takes some getting used to but it's actually very nice.  The Elan Touchpad (not Synaptics) is much nice than the crap they threw on the N81VP (also known issue on the web).  There's a minor bit of keboard flex on the left side.  At this point I can live with it.

Here's where it all breaks down again.  I loaded this thing with Windows 7 Ultimate N 64 and then reached for the included Driver's Disk.  The envelope did look a bit like someone handled before.  Loading it up I discovered the disk was completely empty.  4.7 GB free.  Nice going ASUS.  I went to the website to load the drivers.  All were confusingly there except the NEC USB 3.0 drivers.  foobar2.  A few days later I started hearing a loud and seriously annoying whine coming from the bottom edge of the laptop.  At times the high pitch sounds as though it resonates through the right hand side of the keyboard.  Swap  the hard drive out with another and still a sound.  I can barely stand using the laptop for 30 minutes as the whine is just so piercing as if you're ears are ringing.  And your ears continue to sound as if it's ringing long after you've turned off the machine.

Asus, also take note.  The power plug on the left.  That's going to be an issue in the future.  I'm not sure anyone uses these plugs anymore.  Why is the pin side of the plug on the laptop side?  It should be on the power supply side in case they get bent and require replacing.  The pin is actually 5 shards coming to a point with each shard suspect to bending if not careful.  It's like stuff that belongs in 1990s electronics.

I won't be buying another ASUS anytime in the future.  I bought into the SquareTrade hype about the most reliable computers being Asus.  It's clearly not the case.  I should of relied on my intuition.  It's just not possible for a new comer to the scene to establish that level of quality.  Frankly, hate to say it but you can't beat Dell after service for repairs.  My friend also bought an Asus desktop (i7-920) for his work and they've had nothing but issues.  2 years and 1 year accidental sounds nice.  It's not so nice when they don't fix your machine right.  It's not nice that they don't supply shipping materials for the RMA.  It's not nice when they make you pay for Advance Replacement shipping for your parts.

"The Asus N61JQ-X1's performance is excellent, when it works. That's the good. But it is too cheaply made, unreliable and has too many hardware failures. I suspect that a lot of these glowing reviews were probably done when the laptop was brand new before it stood the test of time.

I have had this laptop since September 2010 and it's now March 2013. At about a year and a half the fan went out. I replaced it, not a big deal in itself. At about the same time the video card started going out. Suddenly while working the video card puts yellow vertical stripes on the monitor while the system freezes and hangs. I have to power off and restart to use the computer again. The yellow stripe freezes/crashes have become more and more frequent. At first it was a couple times a month, now it is once a day or even more. Now I will have to buy another video card. All my other laptops lasted years without any hardware going bad. Planned obsolescence? Cheap parts and build quality? I don't know.

The Asus N61JQ-X1 is marketed as USB 3.0, the latest and greatest and ""future proof"""". What they don't tell you is that ONLY ONE of the THREE USB ports is actually USB 3.0 (the single one on the left side).

"Bought this laptop on Amazon in July 8, for $949.99
Needed something for college and a well be future proof for at least 2 or 3 years
I must say, since this is my first laptop, it is everything I could want + more
Like all the other reviews I've read, this laptops pros are that it is absolutely fast and is powerful
Great graphics, speed, design, and is comfortable to use for hours.
Chiclet keyboard is great, I can type fast to take notes and multitask
some people complain about the resolution, but it's an great display and it hasn't failed to impress me yet
not a lot of bloatware like people said, got all the bloatware removed within like 15 - 20 minutes

Dislikes:
venting of the left side can get quite hot
fingerprint magnet on the cover, i have to clean it quite often
speakers arent that great, i use my usb speakers instead

Overall, I am well pleased with me investment and it's an awesome laptop. definitely would recommend buying!","['laptop amazon', 'need college', 'future proof year laptop', 'fast powerful great graphic speed design', 'comfortable use hour chiclet keyboard', 'great type', 'fast note multitask people complain resolution', 'great display', 'impress lot bloatware', 'minute dislike', 'hot fingerprint magnet', 'clean speaker', 'great use usb speaker', 'investment awesome laptop']"
"I have 2 laptops- an asus quad core full-sized and my asus netbook.  For everything except heavy duty gaming, I am much more likely to use the light-weight, power sipping netbook.

I have used the netbook for Microsoft Access, Word and Excel documents countless times, and it never let's me down.  I have yet to experience a crash on this machine.  It is plenty speedy for the above tasks.  I also use it to play some games on kongregate sometimes between classes.

I use a microsoft bluetooth mouse and have no perceptible lag.  I'm glad I got a netbook with bluetooth.

the battery life is about what you'd expect.  I typically get 5-6 hours out of the bat, but I can coax 10+ hours of light use by turning the display brightness down and turning on power-saver mode.

my only complaint is that the finish has come off the touchpad a bit, but it doesn't affect performance, so that is no big deal.  Great little machine, I recommend it.","['laptops asus quad core', 'asus netbook', 'heavy duty', 'likely use', 'light weight power', 'netbook netbook microsoft access word excel document', 'countless time', 'experience crash machine plenty', 'speedy task use play game kongregate class use microsoft bluetooth mouse perceptible', 'netbook bluetooth battery life', 'hour bat coax hour', 'light use', 'display brightness', 'power saver mode complaint finish', 'touchpad bit', 'great little machine']"
"Out of the box and running less than 15 mins, Windows 7 looks alot like vista with no issues so far.  First impression of the notebook was that it looked clean and business like, far from the truth when I popped in a few games, Dragon's age runs at near all high settings flawlessly with no stuttering or major fps drops and is stunning, runs warcraft @ 50fps in Dalaran, programs are fast, a very nice all around notebook, hard drive is a bit small for gaming, but who needs a bunch of games loaded all at once, does warm up but not too hot, for extended gaming sessions a cooler would be a good idea.  Onboard speakers are actually very good, resolution could be higher, but looks great, gloss finish on the screen does produce glare if not positioned right.  IMO price vs performance, this thing is a 9.5/10 for what it is and what it is capable of, if you know what you are buying, you will not be dissapointed, this is not a desktop replacement, simply because I prefer the performance of a desktop but the N61J performs outstanding considering its a notebook.","['box run min windows', 'vista issue', 'impression notebook look', 'clean business', 'game dragon age run', 'high setting', 'major fps drop', 'run warcraft fps dalaran program', 'fast nice notebook', 'hard drive bit', 'need bunch game load', 'session cooler good idea onboard speaker', 'good resolution high look', 'great gloss finish screen', 'glare position', 'imo price vs performance thing', 'dissapointe desktop replacement', 'performance desktop']"
"Purchased in 2010 and used almost EVERY DAY since, Asus has once again has created a work of art. I never write product reviews but I had to make an exception this time for this laptop. If you're looking for a high performance laptop for all of your multi-media needs, this laptop is sure to not disappoint. I use mine everyday for video games and video editing. The Intel core i7 combined with a speedy HDD and 4GB of RAM is definitely enough to run smoothly for years to come. Also, with all of the extras this thing comes with (bluetooth, multi-finger touch-pad, USB 3.0, ect.) you wont have to worry about connectivity and will quickly be able to navigate Windows with the touch-pad shortcuts. The graphics card is definitely enough to play many earlier games from 2010 on mid to high settings, however it will unfortunately struggle with current and newer games to come. Asus has been a great company that has yet to disappoint me.

In Short,
The Good:
i7 (although it's 1st gen)
Quick HDD (7200RPM)
Bluetooth
USB 3.0
HDMI out
Decent graphics
Scratch Resistant (keyboard and pad area)

The Bad:

Si se intenta registrar otra cosa, no te lo va a permitir, he leido que hay empresas que prestan el servicio de recibir tus cosas alla pero no lo he utilizado.

"This machine is reliable, fast-booting, and fast-performing, thanks to a fast processor, enough RAM and a 7200 rpm hard drive. I use the GIMP (similar to Photoshop) for graphics and Adobe Premiere Elements for video editing and it handles these tasks with ease, even with Norton Internet Security and several other things running in the background. Build quality is sound. Keyboard has a good solid feel and is plenty wide enough. Overall, it's terrific and I would buy another Asus. If you're looking for an excellent laptop at a good price, this is the one, if you ask me. There are a few drawbacks, but nothing major: I don't like the touchpad too much--it seems to have a hard time putting the cursor where I want it and I have to press down fairly hard to get the cursor to move bottom to top. It has a lot of fancy features like three-finger swipe, rotate, etc., but these were kicking in accidentally a lot, so I turned them all off. The screen has a little piece of crud in between the plastic outer cover and the actual display--not a big deal, but like an itch you can't scratch. The external off/on switch for the wi-fi & bluetooth is very handy to have, but it's right next to a USB port and it's easy to hit the switch when changing out devices and turn wi-fi off by mistake (at least with my hands). All these shortcomings have been small compared to the overall experience.

"Pros:
Value, Speed, LED Display, USB3, Latest Components (Core i7-720QM, DDR3 Memories, and 1333 MHz BUS), Reliable Manufacturer

Cons:
Cooling system

There is always something missing in Sub $1000 Laptops that make your system old in 2 years and slow to work in 3 years. The game is that Laptop manufacturers are making sure that you will come back for a new system in about 3 years. If you spend more, you improve quality of your usage on faster components, and not necessarily the life time of your machine. Laptops will generally last about 3 years on average.
What you get from this Laptop is that allows you to extend the life time of your usage for an additional 8-12 months without compromising on speed and quality of your usage. Asus is a good manufacture, however still there is no assurance that all components will work for the life time of Laptop. Nevertheless you are paying just enough to enjoy a 3 years of speedy processing and gaming, any time longer should be a bonus for you!

Suggestions:
If your System or BIOS does not recognize the 4GB of memories, and shows only 2GB, Restore the BIOS to Default (move the battery and press and hold the start key for 5 second to discharge before you turn it back on again) or call ASUS.
Asus should really think about the location of Fan or Fan auxiliary, however make sure you don't block it, especially when you place it on your lap.

"So I bought this Laptop in January, at the time it's features were unrivaled by any other vendor. One of the first I7 and 5 series gpu's lay before my eyes. I promptly sold the dualcore asus I bought in October for the same price and picked this one up and I must say it was well worth it. Dump the bloatware and this thing just what seems to be a limitless about of desktop processing power.

For single threaded apps it overclocks the clock speed to 2.8ghz, for multi-threaded it uses 1.6ghz two threads per core that works wonderfully in windows 7. As for the gpu I regret that I haven't put much on in the way of games, however I saw a notciable improvement in video playback on both it's led screen and my monitor colors just seem more vibrant and the playback is smoother I don't know if this is just because I haven't used an ati card in awhile or no. The only game I have tried was street fighter 4 everything on max with no AA left me with 60fps at the native laptop resolution.

As for the case and screen the the led screen is alright, the viewing angle isn't so good thought it is still backlit I would say my other screen was better in fact. As for the case all around the keyboard and keypad is rubber.. I don't honestly know how I feel about this yet, as for the plastic it's pretty chaep it's a good thing this thing comes with a accidental warranty because I have dropped it in the bag while reaching down for something and it left a mark. :-(

all in all you can't beat what this thing packages anywhere else. USB 3.0, I7 CPU, ati direct x 10 1gb gpu, 4gb ram upgradable to 8gb, bluetooth, wireless n. What more can you ask for?

"This is the first notebook I have purchased so maybe my experience (or lack of) is affecting my review.  One of the reasons I got it was to replace my older desktop, which the Asus does a great job at for a notebook.  It is larger than many other models an offers plenty of screen and key board space, it is quite at home on my desk.  But I also wanted the versatility of being able to travel with it, and if you don't mind lugging around close to ten pounds it does that as well.  The problem with going mobile is the battery life, you only get about 1.5 hours before the battery warning comes on.  I compromised this feature for all the other great features it does have: crisp, clear and large screen; blistering fast speed, great sound; solid build.  All in all it is a great notebook but not sure if it is worth the money at over $1000.00 with so many others available at far less, but again I haven't experienced them either so maybe not.  I am happy with mine and would recommend it to anyone that can afford it and is not looking for the best value neccessarily, just looking for the best.","['notebook purchase', 'experience lack', 'review reason', 'old desktop asus', 'great job notebook', 'large model', 'plenty screen key board space home desk', 'able travel mind lug', 'mobile battery life hour battery warning', 'clear large screen blister', 'fast speed', 'great notebook', 'sure worth money', 'good value']"
"Hi everyone. I bought this laptop on March 1, 2010. The first thing I did was max out the memory to 8gb. The i7 and the Mobility Radeon HD 5730 make this machine the beast it is. When I set out to buy a laptop back in 2010 I was looking for a desktop replacement that could run the Adobe Creative Suite and play games too. I work a lot in Photoshop, Indesign, After Effects and Premier Pro so I needed a beefy machine. Three years later and I'm still creating with zero glitches or lag using Adobe CS6.

Now about a year ago I did experience overheating on both the processor and video card which resulted in the laptop turning off. Note that the laptop always runs 8-10 hours a day in high performance. The symptoms appeared when I began playing Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. In response to the issue, I loaded GPU-Z and realtemp.exe and diagnosed it as overheating. I suspect that those other reviewers who have had video card failure experienced overheating. Now check this out. After I collected the overheating data I contacted Asus even though the laptop was out of warranty. I informed them of the situation and they promptly sent me a label to send in the laptop. I had the laptop back in two weeks. I'm not bothered by the overheating because Asus support is topnotch in my book. They've made me a brand loyal customer. I bought two of my kids Asus laptops for Christmas.

Anyway, if I had a complaint it is with the battery life. It died in its 13 month. In short, Asus stands behind there product and this product is rock solid in it's 3rd year.","['laptop march thing max memory gb mobility radeon hd machine beast', 'laptop look desktop replacement run adobe', 'creative suite play game work lot photoshop indesign', 'pro need beefy machine year', 'zero glitch', 'adobe cs year', 'experience overheat processor video card result laptop', 'note laptop run hour day high performance symptom', 'eld scrolls skyrim response issue load gpu realtemp exe diagnose', 'reviewer video card failure experience', 'datum contact asus laptop warranty', 'laptop laptop week bother', 'asus support topnotch book brand', 'loyal customer', 'kid asus laptop christmas complaint battery life', 'short asus stand product product rock', 'solid rd year']"
"Had this computer for a couple of months now. I am not really a techie, just an average user. Purchased this based from the good reviews here in Amazon. For the price alone, with a core i7 processor added with their warranty (which I hope I won't claim), no doubt that this is one of the most affordable units out there. It's not as stylish compared to others but looks are subjective, this unit appears to me, both elegant and contemporary. Besides, I didn'y buy this for it's looks but for it's power. Just read the specs and drool. It has a nice well-spaced chiclet keyboard(not lighted) which is comparative to a Vaio, lots of ports and connectors and the latest USB 3.0. Drawbacks that I encountered though which you will read also from other reviews are the low screen resolution which I really don't mind, besides that's what having an LED/LCD HDTV for; the vent on the side tends to get hot. I bought a fan for it though amazingly, the bottom part is cool; sensitive touch pad but I use an optical mouse so not really a concern. I suggest you buy an extra long lasting battery as this computer drains your battery fast especially when you are mobile.

"I ordered this laptop about a month ago and have been very impressed with both the performance and the look/feel of the notebook.  This is my first ASUS after bailing off of the HP bandwagon for the last few years.  The slim design and light weight package are very attractive.  The keyboard gives a nice resistance when typing (almost as if it has some kind of magical 'type-assist'#....as well as plenty of space between the keys.  The other comments regarding resolution are somewhat right, depending on what you're doing with it.  The Video Magic software from ASUS allows for enhancement for videos, and I've been impressed with the output.  The only disappointment would be if you do a lot of work in PS CS4...the resolution isn't the best for fine-tuning high-res photos.  Not really a big deal.

The only other downside is that my webcam is upside down.  Jeers to ASUS for not yet addressing this problem with this model on their website.  I used a 3rd Party workaround and it seems to work now #in most cases#.

Otherwise, great speed....loaded CS4 in under 30 minutes and it boots Photoshop CS4 in under 10 seconds, twice as fast as my duo core HP.

"As a Software Developer I was looking for something that was powerful and affordable. I need to be able to fire up a proper dev environment anywhere, without worrying about the pitfalls of laptops one usually gets at this price (they're really underpowered).

This laptop delivers on power. I can run multiple instances of Visual Studio 2010 with Sql Server running full steam, music in the background, office apps all over the place and this thing does not even blink. Incredible stuff.

However, it overheats bad. Real bad. If you're running those eight cores anywhere near their full potential then you are going to know all about it. If it's on your lap, you will want to take it off your lap with 10 minutes or so. If your left hand is near the exhaust where the heat is dispelled, you will want to move it quick-sticks.

Yes, this laptop heats up fast when you put it to good use, and this is unpleasant. Furthermore, when running full steam you don't expect it to go more 90 minutes or so. The battery life is pathetic. So much so that after only 2 weeks of using this pup, my Asus is now for sale.","['software developer look', 'powerful affordable need', 'able fire', 'proper dev environment', 'pitfall laptop', 'power run', 'multiple instance visual studio sql server run steam music background office app place thing blink', 'incredible stuff overheat', 'bad real bad run core', 'lap minute', 'exhaust heat dispel', 'yes laptop heat', 'fast good use', 'unpleasant furthermore run steam', 'minute battery life pathetic week pup asus sale']"
"Some people are blind (it IS brown. Not black. You have to hold it it bright light to see this however which is elegant in my opinion) and others are just plain stupid. This laptop is hands down awesome. It does run hot, but the i7 720qm thermal specification is 100c!!! Don't worry about it running in the mid 50's to 60's range. Just make sure you turn the power cord to the back or it sort of obstructs the fans; which are dead silent. I will be buying a cooler pad for this. It has a 2-3 hour battery life depending on your battery settings. But if you are buying this machine, you are aware that the components you're buying are not low power, economy parts. They are parts designed for making your life simple and easy with regard to your laptop. And they are very successful. Windows boots to idle extremely fast and NOTHING I have done so far has caused so much as a hiccup. Streaming Pandora, running UTorrent, up to 15 Firefox tabs running, pulling viedo files off my network and burning a dvd simultaneously? The 4 physical and 4 logical cores barely move. Feel free to check your email in the meantime. I would recommend reinstalling windows 7 with the disc to a single drive. You will have to reinstall the drivers and whatnot, but this is a very simple task. It eliminates the bloatware others have complained about. By the way, the bloatware didn't slow this thing down a hair the first time I booted her up. The touchpad is as good and better than any other. I did buy the wireless microsoft mouse and I also recommend it. Wireless N shows 150 mb/s for me and I get full signal with a netgear wndr3300 throughout my house.
The ONLY problem I could imagine, unless you're a tool and think not having xp is a problem, is that the screen can be glossy. Doesn't bother me though.

"9-7-2013: This laptop is still perfect for Starcraft 2; except for the 4 Vs 4, but it is still playable. It is because of the Stream Processing and the mighty CPU. Starcraft only wants 6Ghz of the CPU. This laptop expresses massive stress if that you are using it for streaming your live games.

Asus will not answer you for any of your technical help.
_________________________

Well, I've personally gave it a solid state drive instead of a Hard drive. Upgraded it to the Windows 7 Ultimate, and the Asus compatible to it. the laptop comes with its 1 CD of drivers that'll cover everything in a single installation (it'll take about 20 minutes to install all everything from the mobo plug-in play).

The GPU feels like a 650Mhz core clock, making the 1GB of ram GPU extremely useless. The vid card is only strong enough to run on medium settings of your games such the Street Fighter 4, but stronger than the xbox360's ATI GPU. The Ultimate settings on Starcraft 2 demands 1GB of the GPU ram, but it no longer runs at 60fps but very poor performance. You'll want to stay at medium for its 60-fps at the very high resolutions. This laptop GPU doesn't have a logic with going faster fresh rate of frames at a smaller resolution, only at the highest HD resolutions it attends to go faster at 60fps medium settings. The Street Fighter 4 medium settings hits it beautifully at 60fps with only the use of the GPU ram of 136mb.

The CPU's FSB is a dream come true when it comes to the loading times with the solid state. It'll make the ram feels like 1666Mhz than it is originally 1066mhz. No needing to wait for a boot, truly instant.

Battery experience:
Without any heavier game application, it last 1 hours and 48 minutes. With the heavier game application it'll last 38 minutes.

Hm... The USB 3.0 isn't compatible with my Sprint on the road wireless G4 net speed, only the 2.0 on the other side of the laptop.

The CPU is a Bonifiede pro. There was nothing that I can do to stress it, putting my desktop to shame to put away from the last 3 weeks ago.","['perfect starcraft vs', 'playable stream processing', 'mighty cpu starcraft', 'ghz cpu laptop express', 'massive stress stream', 'game asus', 'technical help', 'solid state drive', 'hard drive upgrade windows', 'ultimate asus compatible laptop', 'cd driver', 'installation minute install mobo plug play gpu', 'mhz core clock', 'gb ram gpu', 'useless vid card', 'strong run medium setting game street fighter', 'strong xbox ati gpu', 'ultimate setting starcraft demand gb gpu ram', 'long run fps', 'poor performance', 'medium fps', 'resolution laptop gpu logic', 'fast fresh rate frame', 'small resolution high hd resolution', 'fast fps medium setting street fighter medium setting', 'gpu ram mb cpu fsb dream', 'solid state ram', 'mhz need', 'instant battery experience', 'heavy game application hour minute', 'heavy game application minute hm usb compatible sprint road wireless net speed laptop cpu bonifiede', 'pro stress', 'desktop shame']"
"Keyboard:
Chiclet keyboard feels nice, the large keys and a number pad are great! When I ordered this laptop I was worried I would get the UK keyboard layout with the large return key and the backslash key in a inconvenient location.  When I received the laptop I was pleased to find that it was the standard US keyboard layout with large enter, backspace, shift, and control keys which is a nice change from other laptop keyboards that have smaller keys.

Color:
The page says the color is dark brown but appears black under almost all conditions, a plus in my book.  I had to shine the back with an LED flashlight for it to appear brown.  I haven't taken outside in direct sunlight but it may appear more brown outside.

Build quality:
I would rate this a medium.  It shouldn't break under normal use but it doesn't look as sturdy as some others. Very bright white LEDs on both sides of the laptop blink when in standy mode or when powered on make the laptop distracting in a darker room.  I like the quiet fan volume.  Even the DVD drive is fairly quiet.  Screen hinges look nice and shouldn't break easily.

Performance:
Windows 7 boots fast!  Windows Experience Index of 5.9. Runs most all modern games on high quality.  Great performance for the price.

Ports:
Aside from the standard ports, this laptop has an HDMI port with audio out, one USB 3.0 connector, an eSATA connector!

Bundled software:
Comes with standard game demos, Office 2007 trial, and various ASUS utilities.  Nothing special but not nearly enough to be considered bloat-ware.  Comes with Windows 7 and driver re-install disc as well as recovery disc maker software.

Audio:
Great sound quality for laptop speakers. No noticeable distortion even at high volume!

Battery life:
Mediocre, I average about 2 hours in power saving mode.  But what do you expect from a gaming laptop with an i7 processor?  Get a netbook if you want battery life :)

Warranty:
Great warranty, came with one free year of accidental damage protection.","['keyboard chiclet keyboard', 'nice large key number', 'great order laptop', 'uk keyboard layout', 'large return key backslash key inconvenient location', 'standard keyboard layout', 'control key', 'laptop keyboard', 'small key color page', 'dark brown', 'black condition', 'book shine lead flashlight', 'direct sunlight', 'quality rate medium', 'normal use look sturdy', 'side laptop blink standy mode power laptop distract', 'dark room', 'quiet fan volume dvd drive', 'quiet screen hinge look', 'performance window boot', 'fast windows experience index run', 'modern game high quality', 'great performance price port', 'standard port laptop hdmi port audio usb connector esata connector', 'standard game demos office trial asus utility', 'bloat ware', 'windows driver install disc recovery disc maker software audio', 'great sound quality laptop speaker', 'noticeable distortion high volume battery life', 'mediocre average hour power', 'laptop processor netbook', 'battery life warranty', 'great warranty', 'free year accidental damage protection']"

1. Battery life - Horrendous, but you would expect this when buying.  Power-saving measures help but don't hope for more than 2 hours unplugged in most usage situations.
2. No backlight on the keyboard - would certainly hurt point #1 even more, but the benefits would greatly outweigh the costs.
3. Heat - doesn't bother me at all as its rarely on my actual laptop.
4. Noise - super quiet laptop, you can barely hear the fan during normal use.
5. Overall performance - I've yet to find myself complaining about the computer being too slow.  I've done some fairly CPU-intensive work on this laptop and quite a bit of multi-tasking and it hasn't missed a beat.
6. USB 3.0 - spectacularly fast, a real genuine plus.
7. Bloatware - easily removed in a matter of minutes upon first receiving the laptop.
8. Weight - light enough for what it does, but no featherweight.  I carry it up and down stairs often, move it around the bed and the desk with no problems.  Its not bulky.
9. Keyboard and touchpad - keyboard takes some getting used to, but the full number pad is nice.  Multi-gesture touchpad works decently well but one of the greatest frustrations with this entire laptop is how sensitive/exposed the touchpad is to your palms accidently moving the mouse with the touchpad while typing.  I do not have huge hands, and it happens ALL THE TIME.  Very frustrating.","['entertainment purpose laptop', 'outdate spec', 'available number cruncher sort benchmark', 'available internet comment thing stand', 'practical everyday useage battery life horrendous', 'hope hour', 'usage situation backlight keyboard', 'hurt point benefit', 'outweigh cost heat bother', 'actual laptop noise', 'super quiet laptop', 'normal use overall performance', 'complain computer', 'cpu intensive work laptop bit multi', 'matter minute', 'laptop weight', 'light featherweight', 'stair bed desk problem', 'bulky keyboard touchpad keyboard', 'nice multi gesture touchpad work', 'great frustration', 'entire laptop', 'sensitive expose touchpad palm', 'mouse touchpad type', 'huge hand']"
"*update Aug 2013
New SSD is in (Crucial M4 256gb - blaaaazing fast) and usb fan is cooling it nicely. See pics in review for holes i drilled in bottom plastic (matching curve of the heatpipes) that enable better cooling :)

*update March 2013
Still going strong. Will be installing new hard drive soon, solid states dont last long, and I use it daily for several hours. Heat is still a major problem, I run everything at lower processor settings and still get overheating occasionally. Will be getting a fan soon, I'm thinking it needs some new thermal paste though, may try to see if I can reach the processor. Still performs faster than most computers I use!

*update* June 2012
Running a 128gb solid state drive now, with 8gb of memory....everything loads instantly! Laptop still in great condition... battery died within the 1st year though...runs fine plugged in and lasts 5min without plug! Hard drive also died...but thats a known problem that they ship with cheap drives...had to keep the costs down somewhere! I would get another or an updated version if this one dies though...fast for a latoptop!

Excellent laptop so far. I use it as a desktop replacement, and so far it has performed admirably!

"This Laptop is blazing fast and delivers as listed.  I use my laptop primarily for music production and daily internet usage but I also ran the Lost Coast HL2 stress test with everything (AA, reflections etc) maxed out and it was averaging well over 100fps.  Windows 7 compatibility has been a dream compared to the hassles I am used to with XP Home-- my FireWire 1814 box connects through a TI expresscard firewire adapter with no problems in Ableton Live.

The computer keyboard gets some getting used to if you are familiar with the Delete key being the top right-most key... as with all newer Asus laptops, they include a condensed numpad layout on the right side of the keyboard that adds the home/break/printscreen buttons up where I'm used to finding Del.  I think the benefits of having the numpad will outweigh this problem once I get used to it.

I read reviews stating that things like spread sheets were impossible to see on this computer because of the screen resolution... this is simply not true.  I formatted a book (spreadsheets involved!) and designed a book cover using this screen and it worked fine.  I do agree with people who have criticized the viewing angle of the screen though--At ordinary angles the image looks incredibly washed out and visibility is restricted to a tight range of screen positions for any given viewer--not ideal for watching movies on the laptop screen.

But!  With HDMI out, I plan to use an external monitor at some point and bypass all of the screen concerns entirely.

The computer removes heat VERY efficiently, but that means that anything in front of the vent on the left hand side will become very hot, so be careful! (i've melted one chapstick and one chocolate bar by placing them somewhere nearby during gameplay use).  Overall this computer just blows my mind.  I can alt-tab out of a game, start a music program, and open 10 chrome pages, all at the same time and it won't break a sweat.  For instance, the computer runs the dolphin emulator flawlessly on low settings (this is a pretty demanding emulator).

Anyways, I researched computers for a couple days straight and this one was by far the best deal i could find for under $1000.  Buy this right now if you are even slightly interested!  Hah, WORD OF WARNING:  Amazon shipped my latptop in its original Asus box with pictures and specs of the laptop all over it--I would recommend selecting gift wrapping if you don't want people knowing that a valuable product is inside.

"I've had this computer for about a year now, so I can offer a review here without the bias of that initial haze of excitement.

Pros:
-The technical specs are good. I'm not a hardcore gamer, but I've been able to run everything I've wanted to run smoothly except GTAIV (but performance-wise, that game is broken anyways), including WoW, The Sims 3, Civilization V, and the Total War series, all on high settings. Light modeling and Photoshop also ran with no issues.

I've listed a lot more cons than pros, but keep in mind that the pro is an important one.

Cons:
-If you use this computer on your lap, it runs uncomfortably hot. I mean it.
-The power cord comes off very easily. Moving it around almost ensures that it will fall out. Again, if you use this on your lap, I guarantee it's going to go unplugged unnoticed at least once.
-Gets dirty easily.
-The screen seems to make contact with the keyboard when the lid closes, so the grime from the keyboard occasionally gets on the screen.
-Not recommended if you are the sweaty palm type. Heat + prone to grime + sweaty palms = very, very bad. I'm constantly cleaning the area to the left of the touchpad where my palm rests because it's constantly gross. I never had such an issue with my other laptops.
-Too big to frequently carry around (I'm a college student). I had to offset this by purchasing a netbook.

As neither a pro or a con, it makes a moderate amount of noise. It does get noticeable while gaming.

In the end, I'd recommend this computer if you're only in it for the specs and the price. As for me, I wish I would have looked more into other factors, like size, heat, and comfort before making my purchase. It runs everything I need to, but it's uncomfortably large, hot, and dirty. Take this as you will; it would probably be fine if it just sat on a desk.","['computer year', 'review bias', 'initial haze excitement', 'technical spec good hardcore gamer', 'able run', 'gtaiv performance wise game', 'wow sims civilization total war series high setting', 'photoshop run issue list lot', 'con pro mind', 'computer lap run', 'power cord', 'ensure fall use lap', 'screen contact keyboard lid', 'close grime keyboard', 'sweaty palm type heat', 'prone grime sweaty palm', 'clean area', 'touchpad palm rest', 'gross issue laptop', 'college student offset purchase netbook', 'moderate noise', 'computer spec price', 'size heat comfort', 'purchase run need', 'large hot dirty']"
"I bought this 16 months ago for my daughter who was going off to graduate school. Within a couple of weeks she was complaining that it ran very hot and had very poor battery life. A few weeks after that the hard drive began to make funny sounds and then the computer would not boot. Tech support at ASUS said that she should send the computer in for service and that the turnaround would be more than a week. She did not have the luxury of not having a computer for that length of time as much of the course material was being presented online. She goes to school three hours away, so I drove to her school and switched out her computer for an older laptop that I had. I ordered a new hard drive, installed it and restored the computer to its original state, and I thought that was the end of it. But a few weeks later, the computer was freezing multiple times a day, and she had to reboot each time. She then informed me that she was so frustrated that she bought a MAC!
I updated the drivers and removed all the software except the OS and it no longer ""froze"""". I have been using this computer ever since with minimal software loaded at startup","['graduate school couple week complain run', 'hot poor battery life week', 'hard drive', 'sound computer boot tech support asus', 'computer service turnaround week luxury', 'computer length time course material', 'present online', 'school hour', 'drive school switch computer', 'old laptop order', 'new hard drive instal restore computer', 'original state', 'end week', 'multiple time day reboot time', 'mac update driver', 'software os', 'long froze computer minimal software load startup']"
"I am a 31 yr old female and had a 3 yr old Dell laptop I was looking to replace that was super slow and froze on me constantly.  I've had this for a month. I am not computer savvy but needed a laptop for my classic ipod collection, connecting remotely to work, and various things like Microsoft office and tons of time in the internet.  I am not a gamer but figured a gaming computer would give me the power and speed I wanted.  I went strictly by ratings on Amazon.  I'm not disappointed by the computer. It's great because it is new and obviously faster.

Like other reviewers have said, yes, the computer looks black to me not brown.  Only upon close inspection in the sunlight can you see there is a bit of brown.  Also This does NOT come with anything but a trial of Microsoft Office-you will need to buy word, excel  etc since there is no alternative like Microsoft works on the computer.

Pros:
Love the ten key on the side. This is a must for me.
Like the touch sensor where you can scroll and zoom; it was easy to learn.
Good size monitor but not too big.
Love windows 7 which I find very intuitive.
Love there is tech support included from Asus.
Computer keyboards seems a little more enclosed making it tougher for crud to get under keys.

Cons:
Though not bad, it's not the nicest looking computer. Toshiba and Sony are going to look and ergonomically feel better though you won't get as high of ratings overall with those.
This does NOT come with anything but a trial of Microsoft Office-you will need to buy word, excel  etc since there is no alternative like Microsoft works on the computer.
Though I love the touch sensor that you can scroll and zoom with your fingers I still find it easier to use a mouse.
Computer gets hot-you need a cooling pad for sure. Hardly a con for me though-has not slowed me down.

"Had to push one of the back panels in so it was seated properly.
There is a tiny gap in the casing by the media reader slot - it is barely noticeable, and I assume it's another part that is just not pushed in all the way like the back piece was.
There is a tiny amount of keyboard flex, but when you're typing you don't notice it - only if you're looking for it/pressing down deliberately hard.
Coming from a mac laptop, the multi-finger gestures aren't as bad as I've read - they seem to work just fine so far (after you know what the gestures are - they aren't all extremely intuitive) After a few days of use I notice it works only sometimes - anyone know whats up with that? If you're getting this laptop I wouldn't count on this feature.
It feels surprisingly light.
The hinge is sturdy - i expect it to last.
The sound: I can see both opinions - it can sound tinny - but it's also... guess what? A laptop. And no, there isn't cell phones with better speakers - although i've seen some that are pretty close to this. There just isn't any lows, and barely any mids - if you really want good sound, ignore the hype Asus created in their advertisement of these speakers (all that's really exciting about it is that the normal laptop speakers are arranged in some special way-and it comes with some tuning software) and get a pair of some decent desktop speakers. Don't expect any miracles with the sound. That being said, the built-ins are decent laptop speakers (the stereo effect will certainly surprise you). & They are plenty louder than my Macbook's built-ins - so i'm not disappointed with it. The sound required some minor tweaking in the SRS software to get it to my liking.
The hand rest is a fingerprint magnet, I can tell it's going to be difficult to keep clean - the fingerprints go on, but they don't wipe off as easy as if it were a gloss plastic.
The back, indeed looks black. It's pretty & understated.
There isn't a terrible amount of bloat-ware.. I uninstalled all of the game trials and a few other programs and that was all i had to do.
It's pretty thin for a laptop this size - not fat looking like those terrible HPs
Mine came with 1333 ram.
I created a backup DVD set when i got the laptop - and that took about 2 hours (compressing the files, creating an iso, and burning 4 discs) with the supplied backup software.
I haven't run down the battery yet - but it says about 1.5 hours.
The video card is...awesome. I ran Battlefield Bad Company 2 (a DX11 game) on all of the highest settings (8x anti-aliasing, highest resolution etc.) And it ran perfectly except for a bit of slow down during massive explosions etc. - but, when the anti-aliasing is turned down to 4x it runs just fine.
I was planning on getting an X25M SSD for this laptop - but...It doesn't really need it! Boots up in seconds... Photoshop opens in about 4-5 seconds...
I saw today that apple revamped their macbook & MBPs - and after looking at them - I would still buy this laptop. It's $1,800 cheaper... And the hardware is still better. Besides that, I am really impressed with windows 7 - After a few days I don't miss anything from OSX.","['panel seat', 'tiny gap', 'media reader slot', 'tiny keyboard', 'type notice look press', 'mac laptop multi finger gesture', 'intuitive day use notice work', 'light hinge sturdy', 'sound opinion', 'sound tinny guess laptop cell phone', 'good sound ignore hype asus', 'advertisement speaker', 'exciting normal laptop speaker', 'special way', 'software pair', 'decent desktop speaker', 'decent laptop speaker stereo effect', 'surprise plenty louder macbook', 'srs software', 'hand rest fingerprint magnet', 'difficult clean fingerprint wipe', 'easy gloss plastic look', 'black pretty understate terrible bloat ware uninstalle game trial program', 'pretty thin laptop size', 'fat look', 'terrible hp', 'backup dvd', 'hour compress file', 'iso burn disc', 'backup software run battery', 'hour video card awesome run battlefield', 'bad company dx game high setting', 'high resolution etc run', 'slow massive explosion etc', 'turn run', 'fine plan', 'ssd laptop need boot', 'apple revamp macbook mbps', 'cheap hardware', 'window day']"
"When I first got this computer back in '10, it was awesome. It didn't last very long on battery power, but hey, that's what you get with a dedicated graphics card and a i7 processor. It did everything flawlessly, it was fast, and it played my games like a champ. Street Fighter IV and StarCraft II ran perfectly on the machine.

After about a year, after the warranty was up, the problems started happening. It would overheat like crazy. If you put your finger on the part of the keyboard above the vent, it would start to burn. Then it started to shut down while playing games. While initially I had StarCraft II on high settings, I had to put it down to the lowest possible settings to even play the game. After a while, this didn't even help, the laptop still shut down. Then I had tried a cooling pad under the laptop, that didn't help at all. I installed a temperature program on the laptop and it showed that the CPU and GPU would go to 210+ degrees F when playing games, and stay at 190+ while browsing the web. I can't even play a HD video on my laptop without it shutting down now. If I watch Netflix, I have to watch in low resolution and not HD because it'll stutter and the audio and video gets out of sync.

I finally found a fix, a small tabletop fan pointed at the vent would cool it down enough that I could play my games without the computer shutting down on me. Unfortunately, this fan is also pointing directly at my fingers, so it gets hard to type -- especially in the winter. The fan has to be on almost constantly now, otherwise the computer WILL overheat and shut down.

I called Asus technical support, they were wonderfully unhelpful. They wanted me to update the BIOS, I did and that didn't help one bit.

And just a week ago, my HDD crashed. I still have no idea why. The computer just wouldn't recognize that a HDD was inserted at all. So I had to get a new one. And so it definitely wasn't a software related issue, the computer is still overheating.

I called Asus again, and they said that the only thing I could do was to send it in for repairs. I'm out of warranty, so it's going to cost me. I can't even get an upfront estimate of the cost, the guy said that they would call me and tell me after they checked it out. So I have to spend the money to send it in and wait probably a month to get a call, just for an estimate of the repair price.

This isn't just my laptop too, my cousin has an Asus laptop and he has the same exact problem with his. I think Asus used to be a reliable brand, it seems they've started to use extremely unreliable and cheap parts for their laptops. I also have a Asus netbook that is a 400 dollar paperweight.

I think it's safe to say I'm never buying an Asus product ever again.","['computer awesome', 'long battery power hey', 'graphic card processor', 'fast play game', 'champ street fighter iv starcraft ii run', 'machine year warranty problem', 'crazy finger keyboard vent', 'shut play game', 'starcraft ii high setting', 'low possible setting play game', 'laptop shut', 'instal temperature program laptop show cpu gpu degree play game stay browse web play hd video laptop shut', 'low resolution hd stutter audio video', 'small tabletop fan point vent', 'cool play game computer shut', 'fan point', 'winter fan', 'computer overheat shut', 'technical support', 'update bios', 'bit week', 'hdd crash idea computer', 'hdd insert', 'software relate issue computer overheat', 'repair warranty', 'cost upfront estimate cost guy', 'month estimate repair price laptop cousin asus laptop', 'exact problem', 'reliable brand', 'unreliable cheap part laptop asus netbook dollar paperweight', 'asus product']"
"Ok so I just got this notebook about a week ago and I had it up and running in no time. My first impression of it is that the color is better than described on amazon. Like others said, it's a very dark brown that can easily pass for black. The screen and the back are a huge fingerprint magnet though. If you are a neat freak like I am, this may be a little problem. I literally clean the screen every 5 minutes ( not that bad though cause i kinda actually like cleaning it :D).

All that aside, this thing is very fast. I had no problems running multiple programs and graphics intensive games at the same time. BTW, i'm not a gamer or anything and haven't tested a lot of games on it but this plays Sims 3 well. There is a lot of initial bloatware installed on this thing, but I actually decided to keep most of it as this notebook could handle it anyway and most of them were not that bad.

Now it's time to get to my big complaint. For those of you who don't know, this notebook comes preinstalled with 3 partitions. 1 is the Recovery, about 16gb. 2 is the OS(main) about 75 gb and the 3rd was Data with about 200 something gb. I REALLY HATED THIS! Within my first week of using this my OS was just about out of space, so I decided to do what I should have done when I first got it, which was to do a clean install and re-partition the hard drive. I backed up all my data and used the asus built in recovery (F9) procedure. Everything went fine until the process was completed and it told me to shut down. When I tried to start it back up, THE SCREEN WOULD NOT COME ON. Nothing I did worked so I had to call ASUS tech line. I must admit that the service was fast and easy. They told me I would have to send it back for service. I'm in the process of sending this back now.

Although my little mishap, I still recommend this notebook. I think my problem was random. Maybe just a bad recovery procedure or something. My advice to new owners is to burn the back up cd's and just use those if you want to re partition the drive.

When I get this back, I'll update on my experience with ASUS tech service and any other thing I can think of.","['notebook week', 'time impression color', 'describe amazon', 'dark brown', 'black screen', 'huge fingerprint magnet neat freak', 'clean screen minute', 'fast problem run', 'multiple program graphic intensive game time btw gamer test lot game play sims lot', 'initial bloatware instal thing', 'bad time', 'big complaint', 'preinstalle partition recovery gb os', 'main gb rd data gb', 'week os space', 'clean install partition', 'hard drive', 'datum asus', 'recovery procedure', 'fine process', 'work asus tech line', 'service process', 'problem random', 'bad recovery procedure advice', 'new owner burn cd use', 'partition drive update experience asus tech service thing']"
"I have had this computer for almost a month before I wrote this review so i could give you all a good review. This laptop is awesome. I am very happy that I purchased this laptop. It is very fast everything runs great on this machine. This is my first Asus laptop and I am so so so happy I purchased it. I am a big gammer so all of the games I have played have worked without any problems on high settings. I play mostly MMORPG type games, so I have played WOW, ROM, Atlantica, and soon Star Craft 2, every game I have thrown at this computer it has worked without a problem.  I also run alot of programs because I am currently in school so I have alot of applications open, and I have my browser open with prob over 20 + tabs, and I have multiple games running in the background along with my Norton working in the background and other background services and this thing DOES NOT SKIP A BEAT. With all that going on I haven't seen this computer over-clock it self yet so its well worth getting the Asus i7 series laptops. The volume is great on some things and others its pretty crappy, the screen is awesome I am not sure what everyone is complaining about because it looks great to me. The keyboard is a chicklet type keyboard but I love it, it doesn't flex on the left side well not on my computer so I am not sure where people are getting that from either, but then again I don't type really hard, I am very fast lite typer, but I have typed hard to see if it flexes and it doesn't so maybe its just their computer. Some people are complaining that there is not a backlight on the keyboard, well all I have to say about that is it would be nice but I type without looking at the keyboard so it really doesn't matter to me.

Now the only bad thing I have to say is the laptop is a finger print magnet and a dust magnet because I am always cleaning this beast LOL. The color is a very dark dark brown and you can't tell it is a brown color unless its under direct light but it doesn't bother me because it looks very professional and I like that. It does get a little hot on the left hand side but the fan does a good job keeping it cool. I did buy a laptop cooler but I don't think it really needs it but I use it anyways and it keeps it pretty cool, but this a laptop after all with alot of power so what can you expect it will get hot sometimes! Over all this is a great computer for just the causal user or for someone who needs alot of power. If you can get this computer when its on sale then grab it, even if you can't the price amazon is offering for this computer is still wonderful because I did alot of research and you can't get this much power with this size screen with any other computer or for the same computer from a different company its more expensive. I had doubts about buying this computer at first and after doing alot of research at least a week worth of research reading reviews and all sorts of thing and I still found that this is a freakin awesome computer from an awesome company. If your a gammer then get this beast it will handle all your games, if you need power for other things and software then this is the computer for you. Like it says its an entertainment laptop I have viewed HD movies on here and it is so amazing, I use headphones ofcourse so the sound comes across great, im a computer geek and very picky so if i suggest this computer to other people then its good.

"I gave this computer 3-stars because it does what I need it to do and the technical specs are pretty good. Not great for the price, but good.

Pros: has great sound, which is important to me. the SRS Premium Sound panel takes alot of playing with to get a good sound with whatever speakers you are using. I normally hate laptops mostly cause the mouse pads, but they copied Apple (in a good way) and made it so you can use 2 fingers anywhere on the pad and scroll instead of having a scroll bar on the side or whatever. I've found myself using other laptops and being confused by their lack of convenience. USB 3.0 makes transferring all my data alot easier and my phone and ipod charges super quick when i use the usb cable.

Cons: only a few days after the 30-day zero bright dot warranty expired i found a few dead pixels, that strangely seem to come and go. the entire thing is very flimsy; the keyboard depresses quite a bit when typing and the screen flexes as if nothing is behind the screen giving it support. it comes with a TON of preloaded games and Asus software, some of which im afraid to uninstall for fear of messing up the OS or BIOS. Pay attention to where your pictures and music and things are saved, as the default path leads to the smaller ""OS"""" partition and it will fill up very quickly. The mouse gets annoying and worn out fairly quick. Even with trying to adjust the sensitivity it either grabs on to an internet tab or something and wont let go or it has a hard time double clicking.

"Yep! I named it! lol. I also watched the advertisement video of the first generation of core i... processors. Wow...nostalgic
The N61JQ-X1 did give me my first BSOD as well as the yellow/blue squares *for me* before I crashed just about 3 months or so after i purchased it in april 2010. However, what I quickly realized is that those crashes were also due to the laptop's heat, and i'm sure you know what i'm talking about. I live in the Caribbean so I can definitely testify about the laptop's heat generation. About a year or so though, after trying to combat this problem by directing a fan to it *since my room doesnt' have AC unlike the computer lab when I was in high school*, this wasnt' going to work anymore. Afte putting it on, I noticed through some temp monitors that my processor and gpu were reading about..80 to 90 degrees (celcius) on regular/idle states, and the room temperature for me here was/is about 30 degrees during the day. I tried applying thermal paste *arctic silver* to the cpu and gpu, but, I didn't notice any drastic change -- only by about 2 degrees. So yeah, about...6 months from this post, I decided to start eliminating the temperature spike by removing the back panel and, it's dropped by 20 degrees now. Oh and I was using the cooler from the time I got the laptop by the way. However, despite all these problems, I'm still impressed by the laptop. I can even run Crysis 3! Back in the day, I could've run Gears of war, Resident Evil 5, Call of Duty  MW2 on max settings. Lol. It takes your back. But this baby isnt' out yet and isnt' close to that.

I'm not sure why others have experienced worse problems such as the loss of their fans etc., but I guess I was one of the fortunate one to notice how to counteract this heat problem a bit quickly. Currently, I have windows 8 instaleld on it, 64 bit, *pro version* and it's running quiite smoothly. No problems, except of course, the heat, and this darn webcam problem I've experienced since 2011, where it keeps telling me that another program is using it etc. and yeah, I've tried a lot to fix this issue.

But the point is, I'm quite pleased with this laptop. It's given me sooo much service, and I'll continue to use it happily, just not as continuously now, as I've been using it literally for at least 8 hours every day since 2010. It's amazing to see how far we've reached in just 3 years, since this laptop uses about 34% more power than the average laptop at the moment.

This is the rig I'm building and I shall be building it when the rest of the parts come a few days after I post this. I've moved onto the desktop stage, and perhaps next year, I'll go with Asus again, but this time, with the haswell processor and perhaps the maxwell gpu. However, I'll go with less rigorous specs.

But overall, I'm quite pleased with this laptop, and I thank Asus for designing this. It's served me well in its.

"I had the experience of working with two of these N61s. The first was exchanged due to what appeared to be a hardware failure, or hardware in the process of failing. On three occasions the computer suddenly lost power. All power. Which appeared linked to the use of the supper USB port on the left hand side of the machine, as two of the outages occurred subsequent to its use. The second machine did not experience this problem.

As well, there were two issues with the display on both machines, one of which could have been adequately addressed had tech support been on the ball. The other had to do with very poor color rendering. Both machines had a very strong blue hue that was difficult to get rid of.  As well the black levels were just poor, and the screen was a dust magnet. As to the reference to Asus tech support. I tried vigorously to implement my own color management profile, but neither comp would retain my color settings profile when emerging from sleep or hibernation, and sometimes from off. This as it turns out is a Windows 7 issue, not Assus. But their tech support apparently were not aware and futiley tried to solve it . So this added to my frustration, as i assumed it was an Assus issue. With the Sony I have now, I have since created a sufficient work around to bring up my color settings. Had I known this at the time, I may have kept the second machine.

Color management issues aside, the distinct blue hue was less pronounced with the replacement machine and after a system reinstall, as suggested by Assus tech support, I got an ok picture.  The first machine was just too poor.

Other than these issues, the display is a dust magnet, the resolution needs to be higher and the black levels need to be improved. As well, the keyboard could have been a bit more solid. And then there was the side lights that all together could have and should have been done with out.

On the positive side. The computer itself seemed pretty awesome. It was very quick with startup, running office, firefox and looking at videos, sometimes all at once. And it ran cool and quiet.  I also liked the rubber skin, was a nice addition.

As I stated, had tech support been more on the ball, I may have kept the machine.  The black levels and lower resolution didn't bother me so much as it did my tech savy friend.  The dust may have become annoying over time.  But the computer itself seemed pretty great.

Looses one star for the display issues and another for the poor tech support, poor quality of the first machine and the other minor negatives.","['experience work exchange', 'hardware failure hardware process', 'occasion computer', 'power power', 'link use supper usb port', 'hand machine outage', 'subsequent use', 'machine experience problem issue display machine', 'address tech support ball', 'poor color', 'strong blue hue', 'difficult rid black level', 'poor screen dust magnet reference asus tech support', 'color management profile comp', 'color setting profile', 'sleep hibernation', 'windows issue assus tech support', 'aware futiley', 'assus issue sony', 'sufficient work', 'color setting', 'machine color management issue', 'blue hue', 'replacement machine system reinstall', 'assus tech support', 'ok picture machine', 'poor issue display dust magnet resolution need high', 'black level need', 'keyboard bit', 'solid light', 'positive computer', 'pretty awesome', 'quick startup run office firefox look video run', 'rubber skin', 'nice addition state tech support ball', 'black level', 'low resolution bother tech savy friend dust', 'time computer', 'pretty great loose star display issue', 'poor tech support', 'poor quality machine']"
"I was excited to get my hands on this laptop after I had read all the customer reviews on amazon that indicated how much of a steal this product was. But after using this laptop for about a month, I am slightly disappointed with some of its features.

The build quality of the laptop is not that great. It feels as if I were to drop it just three feet from the ground, the laptop would cease to function. I was taken aback by this, as my previous toshiba laptop was $400 dollar cheaper than this laptop but was much sturdier. Another low point of the laptop is that the speakers are awful, just plain awful. I still do not understand why asus decided to use such cheap sounding speakers in such an expensive laptop. There is absolutely no bass in it. The build quality is easy to forgive because if you handle your laptop carefully, it should not suffer any kind of damage. But the speakers are something that every owner of the laptop would utilize in their day to day activities. Why did asus decided to cut their corners on this? I would have gladly paid additional $50 if the onboard speakers were of higher quality.

other than my above mentioned grievances, the laptop is good for what it is. The i7 cpu and ATI 5730 GPU allow for laptop to function smoothly. As other users have mentioned, there is a fair amount of bloatware when you first boot it up. The following guide helped me a lot in getting rid of all the bloatware: [...]

I played splinter cell conviction and dragon age origins on this machine and both games ran smoothly on medium to high settings. The laptop does heat up a fair amount when you are playing games but that is to be expected. The laptop also features multi touch touchpad and since this is my first time using a touchpad of this kind, I found the experience to be amazing. The laptop also features a single usb 3.0 port but I don't own any devices with usb 3.0 connectors; so that's that. The keyboard is not full sized but in the last month I have gotten used to placement of all the buttons. It's not amazing but not a deal breaker either. The battery life is about 2 hours and you can stretch it to 3 hours by dimming down the screen brightness and switching devices like bluetooth off.

I am giving this product 3 stars because from a hardware standpoint, there is no other laptop out right now that can match this one at the same price point. Plus, other companies charge at least additional $100 for the warranty plan that asus gives on this laptop for free. I really wish that this laptop had better speakers because then this laptop would have been perfect.","['hand laptop', 'customer review amazon', 'product laptop month', 'quality laptop', 'drop foot ground laptop', 'previous toshiba laptop dollar', 'cheap laptop sturdy', 'low point laptop speaker awful', 'plain awful', 'cheap sound speaker', 'expensive laptop', 'suffer kind damage speaker owner laptop utilize day day activity asus', 'additional onboard speaker high quality', 'grievance laptop good cpu ati gpu', 'laptop function', 'fair bloatware boot', 'rid bloatware play splinter cell conviction dragon age origin machine game run', 'medium high setting laptop heat fair play game', 'multi touch touchpad time touchpad kind', 'amazing laptop', 'usb port device usb connector keyboard', 'placement button', 'breaker battery life hour', 'hour dim screen brightness switch device', 'product star hardware standpoint laptop', 'price point', 'company charge', 'additional warranty plan asus', 'free wish laptop', 'speaker laptop']"
"After a very bad experience with an Asus N10Jh-A1 and due to Asus having a good reputation for laptops- a second unit was tried, the N61Jq-X1 (A1 is same except for having 2 year warranty).  Amazon has changed it's ad for this laptop since our company purchased this unit, as it does not have the TV grade, additional amplifier and cone speakers etc, which was advertised.  Asus website still has these features listed, including a really nice video touting their laptop.  Simply doesn't exist on N61Jq units.

Turned the laptop on for the first time, providing name /date/time, password and reached the create the System Restore DVD's (four required)part of setup. Inserted first new DVD disc and a half hour later, this laptop Blue Screened, BSOD, on SETUP.  When finally back at the point of doing the Restore discs for second time, the second attempt to do Disc #1, few minutes later another error box and BSOD again.  This is going well. Now on third attempt to do Disc #1 which started at 26% ?? and later, FOUR hours later, the four dvd backup discs are finished.  Don't expect I could trust these discs to Restore anything.  Day Two: ASUS was sent all the technical stuff (codes and information beyond my technical expertise, hoping only to provide Asus with information to fix the problem, OR be able to find out it's not repairable, information easily found using Windows 7 which I believe is the best thing Microsoft has done in some time and gasp! might even be better than XP.  Four separate emails and tech numbers from Asus later, the Asus techs are still talking about SRS drivers and issues nothing to do with BSOD.  Since initial setup, the unit in the past three weeks BSOD two more times while watching two movies from internet.  Interesting only for having nothing to do with DVD drive in unit.  The N61Jq-X1 as of yesterday is on it's way back to Amazon.  Going to purchase a Sony VPC-F111FX/H  or if Amazon takes forty days to credit the N61 like they did the N10, will order one directly from Sony.
<Note, clarify previous remark: Amazon is normally very good at returns and taking care of customers problems, and Amazon is a vendor our company will pay a  little more to buy from Amazon due to this customer service.  Everyone will have a bad day, so I wanted to be fair and temper the remark made here with additional facts.  In the big universe of vendors wanting your money, you'd be hard pressed to find a company doing better by their customers than Amazon.  Dillon Precision is one, they're out there, but the bar is up high.>

It is likely in the universe of all the laptops which Asus produces that a couple of 'lemons' will come from their factory.  Have two big issues with ASUS,  First is their Tech Service from two different laptop, our experiences with ASUS Tech department in the past six months is deplorable.  Second, I have a real BIG problem when a manufacturer touts features and hardware that is NOT actually in the laptop.  Go to Asus home website  asutech or [...],, go to Products, to Laptops, Multimedia units, then click on N61, then click on N61Jq  or any N61J  code,, look at the Sound System you should have,  Watch Asus video...THE SOUND SYSTEM, SPEAKERS/AMPLIFIER ETC. JUST ISN'T THERE.  AMAZON IS CURRENTLY CHANGING SEVERAL WEBSITES ADS SINCE THE INFORMATION ASUS FURNISHED THEM WAS WRONG.  INDEFENSIBLE TO SELL A PRODUCT WHICH FALSELY DESCRIBES THE HARDWARE THE CUSTOMER IS EXPECTING TO RECEIVE FOR HIS MONEY.

"I bought this computer as a replacement for a Macbook with a 2.0 Ghz Core Duo, which was really starting to show its age. Boy did I get my money's worth.

Pros:
-Chiclet keyboard, my preferred keyboard style.
-i7 processor. I can run everything my heart desires and this computer doesn't skip a beat.
-Radeon 5730. I finally got a chance to play Portal on a computer (my Macbook wouldn't even run it). Nearly every setting is maxed out on the recommended settings, and those that aren't maxed out are only a notch down. Same with Left 4 Dead 2. This is quite an experience for someone who is used to console gaming.
-Wireless is 802.11n and my laptop DOES have Bluetooth support. I picked my computer up when it jumped from $909 to $958, under the assumption that this model still didn't have Bluetooth, only to discover that I DO in fact have it. Perhaps that's why the bumped the price.
-USB 3.0 port. I use it for my wireless mouse receiver right now, but it's nice to have a bit of future proofing here. I'll have USB 3.0 when devices start to use it.
-Touchpad. I really like the touchpad on this laptop (I have an Asus netbook that has a similar pad). I turn off all functionality beyond 1 tap clicking, 2 finger scrolling, and 2 finger left click. Works great.
-Dedicated volume buttons! About an inch above the F# keys, there are mute, volume down, and volume up buttons. They're a nice addition, I'd rather have them than have to use Fn + F10/11/12.
-Number pad. Totally irrelevant to me, but probably useful to some folks. Might as well toss them in there, since the screen is so big.
-Speaking of, THE SCREEN! It's gorgeous. I did some tinkering with it, at default settings the screen is a bit washed out, but the Win7 display calibrator got the job done, and everything looks right now.
-All sorts of ports. Built in SD card slot, E-Sata, hdmi out, vga out, and two more USB 2.0 ports. More than enough for me!
-The inner body is rubberized! Very nice to touch and rest my wrists on while typing. A really nice touch, in my opinion.
-The speakers are actually quite decent. I rarely feel the desire to put on headphones while playing a game or watching something, the speakers can easily fill a small to medium sized room with a fan in the background. They beat the crap out of the wimpy speakers in my Macbook.

Cons:
-Bloatware! I deleted a ton of stuff right off the bat, and I feel like I have more to delete. I had over 30 GB of space taken up on my HDD before I even used the laptop!
-While playing a game like L4D2 or Portal, the fan on the left side of the laptop is an absolute heat wave. I had a bottle of Axe sitting next to the fan the first time I loaded up Portal, and after around a half hour of sitting in the fan's jetstream, the can was nearly scalding. I can deal with it (and to be honest, the heat could be worse considering the punch that this laptop packs), but just be aware of it. I no longer have anything sitting to the left of this laptop on my desk.
-Battery life. Again, to be expected, but at max settings, Win7 tells me to expect between an hour and a half to two hours at full charge. I don't exactly travel with this though, so I'm over it.
-Initial drive partitions. I have no idea why Asus likes to partition its laptop/netbook HDDs right off the bat, but they did the same thing with my netbook and now this laptop too. The C drive was set to 75 GB and the other drive was 200 something GB. I just merged the partitions back together with the built in Win7 tools, and now I'm back to one partition.

I had my eye on desktop replacement laptops for about two months before I finally felt ok to pull the trigger on this one, and I don't regret my decision one bit. The only thing missing from this computer is a Blu Ray drive, but I felt that I wouldn't really use it much (I have a PS3). This laptop is every bit as good spec-wise as every other laptop in my price range (1000-1300), and it's sub $1000! I can't find a deal breaker here. If you have the money and want a reasonably priced desktop replacement laptop, this one should be near the top of your list.","['computer replacement macbook ghz core duo', 'age boy money', 'worth pro chiclet keyboard', 'keyboard style processor run heart desire computer', 'chance play portal computer macbook run', 'setting maxe', 'setting maxe notch', 'dead experience console', 'wireless laptop bluetooth support', 'assumption model bluetooth', 'fact bump price usb port use wireless mouse receiver', 'nice bit', 'future proof usb device', 'touchpad laptop asus netbook', 'functionality tap', 'click work', 'great dedicate volume button inch key mute volume volume button', 'nice addition use fn number', 'useful folk', 'big speaking screen gorgeous', 'default setting screen bit', 'display calibrator', 'job look', 'sort port', 'sd card slot sata hdmi vga usb port', 'inner body rubberize', 'nice touch rest wrist type', 'nice touch opinion', 'desire headphone play game', 'small medium', 'room fan background', 'crap wimpy speaker macbook', 'con bloatware delete ton stuff', 'delete gb space', 'hdd laptop', 'portal fan', 'absolute heat wave bottle axe', 'fan time load portal', 'fan jetstream', 'honest heat', 'punch laptop pack', 'laptop desk battery life', 'max setting', 'hour charge', 'initial drive partition idea asus', 'partition laptop netbook hdds', 'right bat thing netbook laptop drive', 'gb drive gb', 'tool partition eye desktop replacement laptop month', 'ok pull trigger regret decision bit thing', 'computer blu ray drive', 'ps laptop bit good spec wise laptop price range sub', 'breaker money', 'price desktop replacement laptop']"
"I purchased this system for the dual purpose of gaming on-the-go, as well as having a mobile software development platform. As a college student, having my own system to tote around is far simpler than having to manage files on flash drives, uploading/downloading files, etc. I had been using an ASUS Eee 900 previously, but its processing power and hard drive space were quickly becoming limiting factors. I upgraded to this system at the beginning of October and have been very pleased. Being able to game between classes has been a plus as well.

Those who obsess over playing games at the highest resolution with all settings at Ultra will be disappointed, but those people should know better than to be looking in this price range anyways. If you want to game with good framerates at something better than the lowest settings, you'll be pleased with this system. Running WoW, Starcraft II, TF2, BFBC2, and Mass Effect 2 at 1366*768 resolution with medium-to-high settings all produce capped framerates in normal situations and minimal framerate drops in more intense situations.

Other notes in a few quick bullet points:
PROS:
- i7. They're so far ahead of anything else out there right now, buying anything that isn't an i3 or above seems almost like a waste of money.
- Save for the lights on either side, fairly non-flashy case. Some might want the looks of the ASUS G-series. I like this as it's less of a target to be stolen and has a more professional look for use in the workplace.
- Palm rests below the keyboard are rubberized. No more leaving palm imprints in cheap, coated plastic.
- Numpad. Priceless when working in Excel during accounting courses. 0 key is slightly smaller to make room for the arrow keys, but you get used to it.
- Does a very good job of keeping the system cool. The bottom of the case on the right side stays completely cool. The left side is slightly warm to the touch, but certainly still cool enough to place on your lap without it becoming uncomfortable. However, be aware of where you sit. If there's someone sitting to your left with their own computer, their mouse hand will get extremely hot as that is where your exhaust vent is.

CONS:
- Max screen resolution of 1366*768. Not an overly big deal for most productivity applications, but fonts can sometimes get squished in games.
- Battery life. Don't expect to be gaming for hours without a power source nearby. Using the power options, turning down screen brightness, shutting off WiFi, and only running essential apps, I can get it to last through 2 hour lectures, but that's pushing it. Playing games unplugged will give you lower framerates than when on AC power, and will drain your battery dry in a matter of 30-40 minutes.
- The two lights on the side. They're bright in a dark room, and they blink when the computer is put to sleep. If you're going to be keeping this in a bedroom, plan to shut it down at night.
- Touchpad is just barely in position to be in contact with your left palm at homerow position. Non-issue for me, personally, since I shut off the touchpad and plug in a mouse. The Elantech software has a feature to detect and ignore input when it's your palm, but seems to need configuring and I haven't done so due to using a mouse.
- Bloatware. You're not gonna find a computer from a manufacturer these days without it, though, so this is no surprise. ASUS's software tends to be more in the ""I don't need it"""" category than the """"I don't want it","['purchase system dual purpose', 'mobile software development platform college student', 'system tote', 'manage file flash drive upload download file etc asus eee', 'processing power', 'hard drive space', 'factor upgrade system', 'able game class', 'game high resolution setting ultra disappoint people', 'price range anyways', 'game good framerate', 'low setting', 'system run wow starcraft ii tf bfbc mass effect resolution medium high setting', 'cap framerate', 'normal situation minimal framerate drop', 'intense situation note', 'quick bullet point pros', 'waste money', 'flashy case', 'asus series', 'professional look use workplace palm rest keyboard rubberize', 'palm imprint', 'plastic numpad priceless work excel', 'course key', 'small room arrow key good job', 'cool case', 'warm touch', 'cool place lap', 'computer mouse hand', 'hot exhaust vent cons max screen resolution', 'productivity application font squish game battery life', 'game hour power source', 'nearby power option', 'screen brightness shut wifi run', 'essential app hour lecture', 'low framerate ac power drain battery dry matter minute', 'light bright dark room blink computer sleep', 'bedroom plan shut night touchpad', 'position contact', 'palm homerow position non issue', 'shut touchpad plug mouse elantech software', 'detect ignore input palm need', 'mouse bloatware', 'computer manufacturer day surprise asus software', 'need category']"
"Pros:
-very light and portable
-very quiet (fans automatically adjust depending on system temp)
-good set of speakers in it (they get pretty loud and still maintain clear sound
-multi-touch track pad works well
-facial recognition works well
-HDMI out is amazing, I use it to connect to my tv
-the screen is very clear and there are shortcut keys on the keyboard to adjust the brightness
-laptop is fast with the Intel i5, 4gb of RAM, and the HD 5470
-battery life is around 3.5 hours which is pretty good considering the hardware you are running off a 6-cell battery
-keyboard has plenty of shortcut keys (volume, brightness, media controls, wifi toggle, HMDI toggle, camera, battery mode)
-comes with a 2 year warranty and a 1 year accidental warranty

Cons:
-microphone isn't very good
-keyboard has a little too much flex (it takes time to get used to, doesn't really seem to bother me that much anymore)
-disk drive is tray style, slot style would be much better
-only one audio port which means you need an external sound card in order to use 5.1 surround sound speakers

Overall its a very good laptop with a few minor flaws. For the price you cannot beat it, I tried building a similar laptop with Dell and Lenovo and both came out to around $1000. This laptop is great if you need a portable laptop that is also large enough to be used as a desktop replacement. It has a lot of great features packed into it and I would definitely recommend this laptop.","['quiet fan', 'system temp good', 'clear sound multi touch track', 'work facial recognition work hdmi', 'amazing use', 'clear shortcut key keyboard', 'brightness laptop', 'fast intel gb ram hd battery life hour', 'hardware run cell battery keyboard plenty shortcut key volume brightness medium control wifi toggle hmdi toggle camera battery mode', 'year warranty year accidental warranty', 'con microphone good keyboard', 'time bother', 'disk drive tray style slot style', 'audio port', 'need external', 'sound card order use surround', 'sound speaker overall good laptop', 'minor flaw price', 'similar laptop dell lenovo', 'great need', 'portable laptop', 'large desktop replacement lot']"
"Asus K42jr-a1 Review

Quick Synopsis:  After putting a little time into it, its a quick, peppy system that can play movies and handle most games.  As long as you aren't an extreme gamer, this system will work for you.

The Asus K42jr-a1 runs very smooth and can handle everything I have thrown at it.  I used the recovery partition to reinstall on a single partition, but I have heard of just doing a fresh install.  This also works.  As with many laptops these days, lots of bloatware, but I was aware of this, and cleaned out what I didn't want.  If you are a little weary fully deleting programs (even though you have the utility disk), just deactivate the services and stop certain programs from starting at the boot.  This will also increase your performance.

****NOTE:  When the computer was first booted, it seemed very sluggish.  At times, the cpu light was on, but it appeared nothing was happening.  Task Manager showed no CPU activity.  After a couple minutes, the computer would resume what it was working on.  But, this freezing, or sluggish activity would occur every 5 minutes or so. After some research, I found this obscure, but simple solution.  From (...)

"God help you if you should have to deal with customer service on a laptop. I purchased one of these and within 3 months was having lots of power supply/charging issues. Asus' response was to update the drivers, which were already up to date. So within 3 months of that, the computer literally fried and went up in smoke. Yes, it is under warranty, and the long warranty they offer is great. Unless you actually have to use it. It has been a full 28 days right now since Asus has been working on my laptop. I have spent hours on the phone with them trying to get a status. The concept of a supervisor doesn't exist there. They are more than happy to set the phone down for a half hour and come back later to see if you are still there. So my nearly new computer is still sitting in their repair facility almost a month later. So consider yourself warned. Take these reviews that mention the reliability and customer support to heart and save yourself the trouble and look elsewhere.

The screen is big and looks great. I will give it that much. But it means nothing when the entire machine goes up in smoke and the manufacturer doesn't even seem to know how to fix it. And no, they won't just ship a replacement.","['customer service laptop purchase month', 'lot power', 'charge issue asus response update driver date month computer', 'smoke yes warranty', 'long warranty', 'asus work laptop', 'hour phone', 'status concept supervisor', 'happy set phone', 'new computer', 'repair facility month', 'reliability customer support heart', 'trouble look screen', 'big look', 'entire machine', 'smoke manufacturer', 'ship replacement']"
"I was weary after reading some of the other reviews of this product but I have not regretted my decision to purchase it.  It may not be the right computer for everyone but if you are looking for a laptop that comes with an i7 processor there was no way to beat the price.  When I was able to get a computer that was originally $1200 for $899 I had to jump at the opportunity.  The computer is big and not for easy transportation but if you use it instead of having a desktop I highly recommend it.  I will say that if it would have been full price when I purchased it, I wouldn't have bought it but if you can pick up this computer for under $1000 you can't go wrong.  It is a very good gaming computer, not top of the line mind you but it runs games like Dragon Age and Mass Effect 2 at their highest settings.  The screen is beautiful and has a very large display.  I do agree with one negative review about the zero key on the number pad isn't full which has thrown me off on a couple of occasions but it is barely worth mentioning.

"It has everything...got it stolen from my home but while i had it, It was amazing. Ran Crysis...ran Dragon Age Origins ran oblivion.

It has a huge range for wifi. It has a little problem with the usb...its right where you would have the mouse...yeah...but over then that.

EDITED: I bought the same computer with the insurance...and just one quick thing BUY LOJACK FOR LAPTOPS OR SOME KIND OF retrieving software. This computer a year has never caused me a problem. It boots up perfectly. One thing I noticed though and there is no other way but to do it manually, the things downloaded automatically save to the operating system...manually save them to the hard drive or you will be annoyed by the OS saying it is full after only a few gigs.

"The reviews prior to this one say what a great laptop this is but that it lacked a Blu-Ray player.  The description must have been off when most people first ordered this, and I would be upset if I had thought I was getting blu-ray player, but didn't.  That being said, and I knew what I was getting.  Let me be clear; this is an AMAZING value for what you're getting...even without Blu-Ray.  Think about it; you're getting an Intel Core i7 laptop, with a 1GB ATI discrete graphics card, 17 inch, high def screen, and a 500GB hard-drive...oh and 4GB of Kingston RAM...all for under $1200 (as of this writing)?  Are you kidding me?

I love this laptop, and I was a lifelong HP guy, until my screen died after 2 years of use...the build quality on this is incredible, the screen is beautiful, and as for Blu-Ray...meh.  Everything's going disc-less digital anyway.  A few years from now, and everything will be download only anyway.

Don't let the other reviews fool you, this is THE value in laptops, from one of the most well-decorated manufacturers of the last few years.  Check out some sites on the net, do your research, and I'm sure you'll come to the same conclusion I did...this is the laptop to own.

Good luck and happy hunting.

ADDITIONAL INFO (Posted 3/22/2010) after using this laptop for the past few days, I can safely say that this was a great bargain.  It's faster and more responsive than my previous HP that cost 3x as much.  Also, it came with DDR3 1333 RAM instead of the advertised 1066.  Nice little bonus.  Point being, if you buy this laptop, I doubt you'd ever regret it.","['great laptop lack blu ray player description people order upset', 'blu ray player', 'clear amazing value', 'blu ray', 'intel core laptop gb ati discrete graphic card inch high def screen gb', 'hard drive oh gb kingston ram', 'laptop lifelong hp guy screen', 'year use', 'incredible screen', 'beautiful blu ray meh', 'disc digital year download', 'review fool value laptop', 'manufacturer year check site net research', 'conclusion laptop good luck', 'additional info post laptop past day', 'great bargain', 'fast responsive', 'previous hp cost', 'ddr ram', 'nice little bonus', 'laptop doubt regret']"
"I purchased this laptop after unknowingly buying a stolen Dell Latitude 830 from Craig's List.  Thanks to Dell's Lojack service, the police came to my house with a search warrant and confiscated the Latitude after I would not return the detective's phone calls.  (I wonder why they didn't find the Latitude from the guy who sold it to me??) Anyway, if you own a Dell, the Lojack service does work.  After this experience, do you think I would buy another Dell?  -NOT ON YOUR LIFE.  The police treated me like a common criminal, indicated that they thought I stole the laptop, and trashed my house. The 5 police officers who raided my home were not interested in helping me recover the $$$ I paid for the 830.

At any rate, I decided it was time to bite the bullet and buy new, unstolen, and get a warranty.  After researching Tom's Hardware, Newegg, Amazon, Laptop review and others I settled on Asus with the i7 processor.  I intended to buy the N61 and save $100, but finally decided the 17"" screen was worth the extra money.  The Egg people still had the N71 when I ordered","['purchase laptop', 'dell latitude craig list', 'dell lojack service police', 'house search warrant confiscate latitude return detective phone', 'latitude guy', 'dell lojack service work experience', 'life police', 'common criminal', 'laptop trash house police officer raid home', 'new unstolen warranty research tom hardware newegg amazon laptop review', 'asus processor', 'worth extra money egg people order']"
"Honestly, I thought It would be the best possible deal I could make. Best config available when I bought with a awesome price.
After the first month I've realized it can't be used as a laptop. Seriously, I got my lap literally burned. It is extremely hot.
I've treated it as my personal treasure, since I got it after saving for a LONG LONG time and after 1 months after warranty experied it went dead.
Can you guys imagine how frustrating this can be? I'm on the last semester of a engineering school and I rely on my computer for pretty much everything. I have to write an article or else I can't graduate.
The best part is, since I don't live in the USA, I relative of mine took it here to Brazil and one of the features that led me to buy it was its 1 year international warranty. They do have technical support in Brazil, but it's only in one place which is over 2 thousand miles aways from here.
Now, I'm stucked with this piece of garbage, I can't afford another notebook, and they think I'm a stupid third world country costumer.
I promise you guys I'm gonna be posting lots of videos on how bad this ASUS is.

Advice? I would get something else.","['good config', 'awesome price month', 'personal treasure', 'long time month warranty experie', 'dead guy', 'frustrating semester engineering school', 'article graduate good', 'international warranty', 'technical support brazil place', 'stucke piece garbage', 'stupid world country costumer', 'post lot video', 'bad asus advice']"
"The HDMI port was loose and could not maintain a connection with my HDTV.  (Yes, I did try other cables, all of which worked with other components.)  I mean the port itself wiggled a bit---not the cable in the port.  Typing anything or just touching the touchpad knocked out the connection to the TV.

If you look at how the port is placed, jammed under the ExpressCard slot, you will see that such a problem is not surprising.  I didn't think about it before buying, though I did see a photo showing the layout.

Also, prospective buyers should note that, despite the ATI 5730's abilities, this laptop does not output 1080p to a TV---even with the latest ATI driver update.

I only had the computer about 36 hours, but I always test as much as I can as soon as I can.  In most other aspects, I'd give this computer high ratings.  The only longterm worry would be heat management, as there doesn't seem to be a lot of venting space for such a hot CPU.  Reading reviews, I always though people were joking about keeping coffee warm by placing a cup next to the exhaust vent.  Really works with this unit!

The keyboard is spongy in the center.

Now for the good:

One reviewer complained about the glare.  Personally, I think it is less of a problem than on many units.  Mine came with a protective sheet of what was either real glass or extremely hard plexiglass over the LCD screen, something that adds strength to the display and upper part of the unit.  I liked it a lot.

Sound is very, very good.  This includes the built in microphone!  I actually got the Windows 7 Speech Recognition to work pretty well in just a couple of hours.

The webcam is ok with color and clarity.  In very bright light the typical built-in webcam lag is not too bad.

Battery life was almost three hours, which is amazing considering the battery only has six cells and powers a quad-core.

The keypad is an Elan, and it was smooth, precise, and responsive.

Fast Seagate HDD.  Atheros wireless that worked very well in public and with my own wireless router.

The recovery disk creation process was as smooth as any I've seen, taking about two hours and requiring five blank DVD's.

I thought this was going to be my baby for the next five or six years.  The bad HDMI port, which, true, could happen on any machine, seemed as much a result of engineering as assembly problems, so I'm going to get something else.  The other reason I won't get this one again is it only outputs up to 720p to an HDTV.  Much cheaper laptops with ATI GPU's do put out the full 1080p.

The spongy keyboard was disappointing also.

I've had an Asus laptop for seven years; it has been very reliable, so I will very likely stick with this brand---but I'll look harder at how the ports are arranged.","['hdmi port', 'connection hdtv yes', 'cable work component', 'port wiggle bit cable port type touch touchpad knock connection tv look port place jam expresscard slot problem', 'buying photo show layout', 'prospective buyer note', 'ati ability laptop output tv', 'late ati driver update computer hour test', 'aspect computer high', 'heat management lot', 'hot cpu', 'review people joke', 'warm place cup exhaust vent work unit keyboard', 'spongy center good reviewer complain glare', 'problem unit', 'protective sheet', 'real glass', 'hard plexiglass lcd screen', 'strength display', 'upper unit', 'windows speech recognition work', 'pretty couple hour webcam ok color clarity', 'bright light', 'bad battery life hour', 'battery cell power quad core keypad elan', 'smooth precise responsive', 'fast seagate hdd atheros wireless work', 'public wireless router recovery disk creation process', 'blank dvd', 'baby year', 'bad hdmi port', 'machine result engineering assembly problem', 'output hdtv', 'cheap laptop ati gpu', 'spongy keyboard', 'disappointing asus laptop', 'brand look', 'hard port']"
"I have had this laptop for several months now, and I must say I love it. It took me a long time to even consider buying a laptop since they simply do not have the capacity of desktop computers. However, after owning this ASUS K52 I have become a believer. The layout is great, the design is sleek, and the performance is above my expectations.

Layout and Design: The layout of the laptop is great. The keyboard design is large and spacious enough that my fat fingers do not make the typos I typically make on other, smaller, designs. It also has a full numpad, which is a feature I truly hate not having available. The screen size is plenty big enough to browse the internet, write papers, and/or play games with ease. It is also a sleek and cosmetically pleasing design with rounded edges and corners.

Performance: Now on to the most important aspect of any computer, its performance. I have been able to run any game I have desired to play (Oblivion, Fallout 3, Star Wars The Old Republic) on medium to high settings without much in the way of slow down and frame rate issues. I haven't had any problems with the hardware malfunctioning through all the use I put this thing through. It boots fast, and it plays fast. I also use this computer for all of my many school papers, payments online, and pretty much everything you can use a computer for these days. It has never failed me and continues to perform today as it did the first day I received it.

Conclusion: Overall, it's a great piece of machinery. I love it. It serves all of the purposes I have had for it. There are more pricey laptops out there with a bit more power under the hood, but I have found this one to have plenty to run all the games I love and to quickly and reliably completely all the other tasks I have had for it.","['laptop month', 'capacity desktop computer', 'own asus believer layout', 'great design sleek performance expectation layout design layout laptop', 'great keyboard design', 'large spacious fat finger typo', 'small design numpad', 'available screen size plenty', 'big browse internet', 'edge corner performance', 'important aspect computer performance', 'able run game desire play oblivion fallout star wars', 'old republic medium high setting way', 'slow frame rate issue problem hardware malfunction use thing boot', 'fast play', 'fast use computer school paper payment online', 'pretty use computer day', 'conclusion overall', 'great piece machinery', 'purpose pricey laptop bit power hood', 'plenty run game']"
"I have had this product for two years now. In fact, my two year warranty ran out four days ago. However, I am having hardware failures for the third time since my purchase.

I work in IT and take very good care of this notebook. It never leaves my desk unless I am travelling and I am careful to keep the notebook safe while travelling. I keep my computer free of viruses and malware and regularly clean it with CCleaner and a disk defrag. However, one year after my purchase my hard drive was the first piece of hardware to fail me. I sent in my notebook and two weeks later received my notebook with a new HDD.

A few months ago, my notebook started failing again until it finally would not boot at all. I sent it in and again they fixed my issues and sent me back my new notebook. However, they only replaced the motherboard and the back of the laptop and did not fix the cracked casing around my screen or the dead pixels on my screen like I had requested.

Now, four days after my warranty has run out, my battery has stopped charging and my computer will not turn on unless it is plugged in. This is generally fine for me although it is an inconvenience. However, my HDD also seems to be failing as it has started making clicking noises that are a sign of it failing and documents have been taking far to long to pull up. I contacted Asus support and even though my warranty so recently ran out and I've already had to send in my notebook twice for issues that never should have happened in the first place, they refuse to provide me with service.

In short I do not recommend this notebook to anyone looking for a quality PC. The parts must be terrible quality to fail so quickly and the customer service I've received has been terrible in comparison to any other company I've ever dealt with.","['product year fact year warranty run day', 'hardware failure time purchase work good care notebook', 'desk travel', 'careful notebook', 'safe travel computer', 'free virus malware', 'clean ccleaner disk defrag year purchase', 'hard drive piece hardware', 'notebook week', 'new hdd month', 'fix issue', 'new notebook', 'motherboard laptop fix', 'dead pixel screen', 'request day warranty run battery', 'charge computer', 'inconvenience hdd', 'click noise', 'long pull contact asus support warranty', 'place refuse', 'notebook look quality pc part terrible quality', 'customer service', 'terrible comparison company']"
"I had been researching laptops for more than a year before I bought this one. After buying my son an ASUS UL50VT for Christmas after extensive research, I was hooked on ASUS. Good reviews, nice design, good performance. My laptop needs are viewing movies and shows, heavy surfing, downloading and burning, playing music, and light gaming. This is perfect for my needs.

The first thing I noticed about this one is the keyboard; it is a 'chiclet design' with wider caps which make it extremely comfortable for typing. A lot less errors on my part. The ELAN touchpad (smartpad) is super. For the last year, I have borrowed a friend's ACER and his touchpad drives me crazy. It zooms, the cursor moves and jumps about all the time, frustrating me to no end; I finally had to disable it completely. With this computer, palm detection notes the difference between the palm and a finger so that the cursor doesn't jump around while typing. You can also do pinch and zoom. The large palm rest area is supercomfortable as well and minimizes smudges, unlike the rubbery type ones you see which I hate.

I like the Power4Gear which allows you to select your desired processor mode to conserve battery life and have fan power adjusted. Very handy. The Intel I3 Core is more than enough for my needs, lightening fast, and the NVIDEA GEFORCE 310M graphics is excellent for the light gaming that I do.

The sunken hinges enhance viewing by providing a wider more comfortable and less distracting viewing experience, as well as making the laptop look much more visually appealing and sleek. The sound is great (SRS with ALTEC lansing speakers) for media and music. The computer is really sleek and cool looking and my son prefers it to the design of his.

The first thing that I didn't like is the screen brightness; unless I have it on full brightness, I can't see it. It seems to be dimmer than others I have used, even on full brightness, but maybe it's my imagination? I had it side by side my friend's ACER, with the annoying touchpad, and my son's ASUS UL50VT and both of their screens appeared brighter.

My major disappointment is the battery life, despite a little sticker on the computer that states 'great battery power' or something like that. With screen brightness mid range and just using it for moderate surfing and office applications, the battery only lasts two hours. I had expected more. Another annoying thing is the frequent disappearance of the power icon in the taskbar; the setting to turn it on in the taskbar is greyed out. After googling some forums, I followed the recommendation, logged off and back on. Bingo, the power icon was back. But since the battery life is a disappointment, I don't want to be fiddling around trying to see the power icon to have notice of when it will die.

Conclusion: excellent value. Biggest PRO: other than the speed of I3 (and it is really really fast), it would be the touchpad and keyboard. Biggest CON: battery life.","['research laptop year', 'son asus ul vt christmas', 'extensive research hook asus', 'good review', 'nice design good performance laptop need view movie show', 'perfect need thing notice keyboard chiclet design', 'wide cap', 'comfortable type lot error elan touchpad smartpad', 'super year borrow friend acer touchpad drive', 'crazy zoom cursor', 'time frustrate end', 'computer palm detection note difference palm finger cursor', 'type pinch zoom', 'large palm rest area minimize smudge', 'rubbery type', 'power gear', 'select desire processor mode', 'battery life fan power', 'handy intel core need lighten', 'fast nvidea geforce graphic', 'excellent light', 'sunken hinge enhance view', 'comfortable distract view experience', 'laptop look', 'appealing sleek', 'sound great srs altec lanse speaker medium music computer sleek', 'design thing', 'screen brightness brightness dimmer brightness', 'imagination friend acer', 'touchpad son asus ul vt screen', 'bright major disappointment battery life', 'sticker computer state', 'great battery power', 'screen brightness mid range', 'office application battery', 'frequent disappearance power icon taskbar setting', 'taskbar grey google forum', 'recommendation log bingo power icon battery life disappointment', 'power icon notice', 'excellent value', 'big pro speed', 'fast touchpad keyboard', 'big con battery life']"
"After doing quite a bit of research, I decided to purchase this Netbook.  This is even after highly considering the PU17 which as mentioned earlier comes with a recovery disk but not the nice matte soft touch exterior.  The reason this specific model does not come with a recovery disk is because there is one-touch recovery built in which will restore the PC to its original state from files which are located on the hard drive.  From my understanding, people better start getting used to this since it seems to be where every manufacturer is going.  I also chose to install Windows 7 Ultimate 32-bit instead of sticking with the Starter Edition (see ya later bloatware!!!) which runs very very well on only 1GB of RAM.  I have the 2GB upgrade coming this week (just make sure you get a RAM with CL=5).  The reason I didn't install 64-bit is because you can't use more than 2GB of memory and also because I didn't want to have any driver issues.  In the end, it makes very little difference.  So far it seems that Win7 Ultimate even runs better and smoother than the Starter version, mostly due to the removal of all the crapware that comes pre-installed.

Couple of things to note:  I installed the new OS using a bootable flash drive due to the lack of a CD/DVD Rom Drive (You can make any basic flash drive bootable).  Also, when I was installing the new OS, there were 4 partitions on the HDD.  Two of the partitions were your basic space allocated to storing installed programs/data storage etc, however, there was also 10GB and 17MB partitions which from my understanding contain recovery files.  To be safe, just leave these partitions alone.

All in all, I am very happy with this Netbook and am glad I purchased it.

P.S. - BOO to all the people giving negative reviews because of their own ignorance!  Ex: The description clearly states that there is no Recovery DVD included in the box!  Do your homework people!

"Bought 8/5/10 along with additional memory.
I wanted a netbook that was very portable, easy to access web but with the capacity to load MS Office on it.  The Asus is awesome.  I've had no problems. I deleted the trial version of Office and bought Office 2010 Student and Home Version as I do not use Outlook. This computer easily fits in backup, totes, purses, etc. so I rarely leave it home. It's been to lots of coffee shops, dog parks and swimming holes with me this summer. My home internet is the budget Comcast cable hookup which can be pretty funky at times but so far no problems, even when all three household computers are on-line. Never had a problem anywhere else either. Memory is a bit shorter than advertised but still excellent. Rubberized cover durable and easy to wipe clean.
Cons: Keyboard area shiny and very prone to fingerprints. Touchpad very sensitive and takes some getting used to.

"This system is painfully slow. Internet browsing experience is not good at all but I guess that's the problem with all the netbooks. The small screen can only display so much that you have to keep scrolling all the time. The mousepad makes it even more painful to scroll.. its very insensitive to the finger movements or taps. The mouse button is so hard that you pretty much have to bang on it for a click. I thought it would break-in over the time, but it never did. For over 3 months that I used it, I really felt handicapped. The glossy surface is a bit annoying with fingerprints showing everywhere all the time but I could've lived with it. I just couldn't deal with the horrible mousepad anymore. I just sold it on ebay (so relieved!) and got an ipad!

"Aug. 2011 - update of my original June 2010 review:  and increased to 5 stars.
I still love this little computer.  Amazon replaced the original one with another of same model and the battery seems to be hanging in there just fine - not getting 14 hours but regularly 10-12 so that's pretty good.

Ordered the slightly newer model in June 2011 for my son and husband - it gets lots of use too!

Orig review:
I love the ASUS Eee PC Seashell 1005PE-PU27.  I paid a bit more for the matte black case AND especially wanted the longer battery life (supposed to be 14 hours).
SO I am disappointed in the battery life - not as advertised.  I let it charge fully when it arrived nearly a week ago, and have used it to run down the battery (to 10-20%) and re-charged at least 3 times already.  The absolute top battery life I've seen is 11hrs.45min. - that's only 84% of what it should be.  False advertising? Or bad battery?

When plugged in and charging, the charger, battery, bottom of unit and area left of mouse pad all get very warm - hot.  Is this normal?

I also ordered a 1005PE-MU17 at the same time for a friend and it's battery seems to be functioning at the near advertised expected life of 11 hours.

Suggestions please!

PS  Other than battery life, I'd give this great little netbook 5 stars.","['aug update', 'original june review increase star', 'computer amazon', 'original model battery', 'pretty good order', 'new model june son husband', 'lot use orig review', 'asus eee pc seashell pe pu pay bit matte', 'black case', 'battery life suppose hour disappoint battery life advertise', 'battery charge time', 'absolute battery life', 'hrs min', 'bad battery plug charge charger battery unit area', 'warm hot normal order pe mu time friend battery function', 'life hour suggestion ps battery life', 'great little netbook star']"
"PROs:  Light weight, great textured matte black rubberized surface, remarkable battery life, great improvement over 1005HA-P, Express (Rapid access Linux) feature access

This is our fourth ASUS Eee PC Netbook, fifth Netbook counting our Samsung.

"I've had this netbook for a few months now, and for my needs, it's really great. I am finishing up my masters online, so I needed something that was compact and easy to travel with. It easily fits into my purse and the battery life is insane. When just working on papers and doing light surfing I can get almost 10 hours, and I don't have a tv, so I can stream about 7 hours worth of video without having to plug it in. The biggest con is that the Windows 7 starter is extremely basic. I didn't add any extra memory to it, and I have Office 2010 professional with all of the bells and whistles and it works fine. Skype seems to take a while to load on it for some reason. I don't download tons of music, videos, or pictures, so maybe I would need to add more memory, but for my purposes of school, surfing the net, and watching videos online it's perfect.

"Overall, it's a good machine that meets my needs, but there seems to be a problem with the bluetooth - not sure if it's the problem of the machine or the system (considering Windows Vista's performance, I wouldn't be surprised if it is Windows 7 that causes this trouble).

My Asus can detect other bluetooth devices and send files, but it can't receive any files, either a word document or a picture from other bluetooth devices such as a PC with Windows Vista and a cell phone. Connecting with a bluetooth mouse also needs extra effort. I paid more for its bluetooth feature, but so bad I can't use it. Called their customer service, but they said that's the problem of the other end, so I have to call the manufacturer of my other bluetooth devices -- a PC company, a cell phone company, a mouse company etc. to find the answer.

Other than that, the touchpad doesn't work so well as expected.","['overall good machine meet need problem bluetooth', 'sure problem machine system', 'windows vista performance', 'trouble asus detect bluetooth device', 'file word document picture bluetooth device pc windows vista cell phone', 'bluetooth mouse need', 'extra effort pay bluetooth', 'bad use', 'customer service', 'problem end manufacturer bluetooth device pc company cell phone company mouse company etc', 'disappoint touchpad work']"
"I purchased this netbook in connection with my current trip to the Philippines. Very convenient, light. I can just imagine how much difficulties I would have endured if instead I'm lugging my laptop. No problem connecting with Wifi's. The problem is when only a broadband exists as it happened in some places; I wish I know how to connect with it (the broadband).

I charge the battery full each time but the indicator fluctuates between 8-10 hours. No 14-hour battery life as advertized. Also, I doubt if the indicated hours is reality-based because I noticed sometimes that the charge goes out faster than its indicated content. It's okay with routine works but sometimes more juice is needed and there's nowhere to recharge. Is Asus willing to accept a return for exhange or is the same kind of battery available and affordable to purchase? By the way, I have not added memory or anything to the item.

Another gripe: In using Works/Wordpad/Notepad for wordprocessing, the cursor has a way of jumping all over the place (indiscriminately) without intent on my part such that inputting a text in a sentence in one place would suddenly have its continuation written in another place on the same page.","['purchase netbook connection', 'current trip philippines', 'convenient light', 'lug laptop problem', 'wifi problem broadband', 'broadband charge battery time indicator fluctuate hour hour battery life advertize doubt', 'hour reality base notice charge', 'content okay', 'routine work juice need recharge asus', 'return exhange kind battery', 'available affordable purchase way', 'memory item gripe', 'wordpad notepad', 'cursor way', 'place intent inputte text sentence place', 'place page']"
"I just paid $340 for this netbook, and it was well worth the money. I bought it for my wife to use around the house, and to take with her to class. Once she got used to using the smaller 'laptop' she loves it. I did all the research I could and came down to the fact that this was the best buy. The build quality, features (including Bluetooth!), low heat output, and excellent battery life I've seen on it so far make me feel like I could've paid $400 for it.

The first thing I did was try a recovery using the hidden partition. You basically don't need any CD like the one review complained about. The recovery partition acts as your restore cd. The 3 step directions are in the short user manual on how to use it. I restored it to factory settings in about 15 minutes, just to try it out.

Next thing I did was clean up all the extra add-on softare. There's plenty to remove so try out everything first, then decide what you can remove to free up some resources.

Another intersting feature is the 'instant on' feature. It's like another power button, but boots right into a menu that will open a basic web browser and let you get on the internet, all without ever having to wait to boot into Windows. I could see her using it to quickly jump on and look up something.

Adding another 1GB of RAM would probably be nice, but she's not crunching anything intensive on this thing to make it worthwhile. If you're doing a lot of multi-tasking you probably want a beefier laptop anyway. Maybe down the road when the RAM is $20 we'll throw it in, but she's only doing one or two things at a time anyway.

I'm an IT professional and would recommend this over anything else right now to those looking for a netbook. You won't find anything else that compares at this price range.","['worth money', 'wife use house class', 'small laptop', 'fact good', 'low heat output', 'excellent battery life', 'need cd', 'review complain recovery partition act restore cd step direction', 'short user', 'manual use restore factory setting minute', 'softare plenty', 'free resource', 'power button boot', 'open basic web browser', 'boot windows', 'gb ram', 'nice crunch intensive thing worthwhile lot multi task', 'beefy laptop', 'road ram', 'thing time', 'price range']"
"This is a great netbook.  At times it may lag just slightly, but overall the performance is great for the money.  I have already upgraded to Windows 7 Ultimate, which seems to be faster than the pre-installed Windows 7 Basic, but I imagine that is because I didn't put back on every piece of Asus software.  It's even running the AERO theme on 1GB of memory; 2GB upgrade is on its way.  To comment on the other review which mentioned there is no recovery disc, that is true, and is the only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5.  But knowing this ahead of time would NOT have changed my purchase.  Until I read the other review, I actually thought they may have just left my disc out.  Good to know it wasn't just mine and sounds like a recovery disc isn't included with this model.  Most recent versions of utilities and drivers are easily found on Asus's website.  And as far as being able to reinstall Windows 7 Basic, there is a 10GB hidden partition (which is mostly full) on the hard drive that holds all the necessary files to return the netbook back to its original state.  I have not personally tried this, but have read multiple sources online stating that is what this partition is for.  I have only used this for 3 days now, but so far very satisfied.

One last note, the matte cover is nice, but the screen frame and area below the keyboard is still a finger print magnet.","['great netbook time', 'overall performance', 'great money upgrade windows', 'ultimate fast pre instal windows', 'piece asus software run aero theme gb memory gb upgrade way comment review', 'recovery disc', 'true reason star', 'disc good', 'recovery disc', 'recent version utility driver', 'asus website', 'able reinstall windows', 'basic gb hide partition', 'hard drive hold', 'necessary file return netbook', 'original state', 'multiple source online state partition day', 'note matte', 'nice screen frame area keyboard finger print magnet']"
"I ordered this netbook for my husband and we were both very excited when it came in the mail.  Unfortunately, once it was charged up and ready to go, we found that the internet barely connected anywhere in our house.  Even standing right in front of the wireless router, I only got 3 out of 5 bars of connectivity.  I restarted both the netbook and the router, checked for bios updates and uninstalled and reinstalled the driver software.  All the while, our laptop computer connected to the internet with full coverage and no problems.
Nothing worked for the netbook, so I called up the Asus help line to see what they could recommend.  Both me and the guy I spoke with on the other line had a hard time understanding each other because of a language barrier and I think this may have contributed to the frustration.  He told me there was nothing wrong with my netbook and that I needed to be standing within 5-10 feet of the router for the connection to work.  I explained that this was absurd and that I wanted to send it back for one that worked.  Needless to say, the conversation ended badly.  Luckily, Amazon allowed me to return it anyway.  As always, they have the best return policy.  As I told the fellow on the phone, I won't purchase anything from Asus any longer, but I will definitely get my next netbook from Amazon.","['order netbook husband', 'house stand', 'wireless router', 'connectivity restart netbook router check bio update', 'reinstall driver software laptop computer', 'internet coverage problem work netbook', 'hard time', 'language barrier', 'contribute frustration', 'wrong netbook need stand foot router connection work', 'work needless conversation end', 'return good return policy', 'fellow phone', 'purchase asus', 'netbook amazon']"
"For a netbook, the system is adequately powerful and fast: I have been able to run such programs as MS Office 2010, Photoshop, Acrobat Pro, Dreamweaver, and SPSS on it, and I have been able to watch movies and do everything that I need to do online on it. The battery is truly long-lasting (if you use the wireless card sparingly and don't set the screen at its brightest setting). I have an earlier Eee PC netbook model that this netbook is replacing, and I want to point out that it was very clear to me that ASUS have been listening to user feedback: They have improved the design from previous netbooks substantially. The screen is just a tad bigger than in previous models, and it is just big enough as to not be annoying. I think that at 10.1 inches they have found the optimal screen size for a netbook. Very importantly, the keyboard has been much improved. In previous netbooks, the small keys took some getting used to and even then were difficult to use and created strain. ASUS have resolved this issue by making the netbook slightly bigger and leaving space between the keys of the keyboard. This results in very intuitive typing, essentially no wrong hits, and an easy use - no worse than any laptop-type computer. In fact, I actually like the keyboard, even though I did not get a netbook with the intention to use it for much typing. In addition, ASUS have changed the keyboard layout slightly and have resolved some issues that their previous models had - for example, the PageUp and PageDown keys are now easy to use because they have positioned an Fn key right next to them. These little improvements have resolved my discontents with previous netbooks. The only thing that remains slightly annoying is the metallic sound of the speakers; obviously, one wouldn't buy a netbook for its speaker quality, but I was surprised that the speakers have not improved a bit from previous models. The solution for me is to use a pair of good earbud phones instead of the speakers. Good job, ASUS. My main point of discontent is the choice to sell this with Windows 7 Starter instead of XP or 7 Home; this is mostly Microsoft's fault, not ASUS's, but I have to agree with other reviewers that Starter is an annoying interface. Windows Home is a very marginal improvement from 7 and is not worth the money, so I understand why ASUS would sell this with Starter; furthermore, Windows 7 is a stable and fast system. Nevertheless, its limitations in terms of being able to customize the appearance of the graphic user interface are inappropriate for a netbook. In a netbook, one needs to be able to get rid of unnecessary embellishments to the interface that take up screen space, because the screen space is limited. Windows 7 Starter is limited in this regard, on purpose, by Microsoft, so that you would spend money on Windows Home, and this makes me angry. It's not even the inconvenience that is the problem, it's the evil-hearted marketing decision by Microsoft that embitters me toward Microsoft and, by association, toward Asus. In summary, this is a great netbook, and it is obvious that ASUS have been listening to customers and making slight but valuable improvements to their netbooks that have resulted in this fine product. Windows 7 Starter spoils it enough to take off a star.","['netbook system', 'powerful fast able run program ms office photoshop acrobat', 'pro dreamweaver spss', 'movie need online battery', 'wireless card', 'bright setting', 'eee pc netbook model netbook', 'clear asus', 'user feedback', 'previous netbook', 'screen tad', 'big previous model', 'optimal screen size netbook', 'previous netbook', 'small key', 'difficult use', 'strain asus', 'space key keyboard result intuitive', 'wrong hit', 'easy use', 'bad laptop type computer fact', 'keyboard netbook intention use', 'addition asus', 'keyboard layout', 'previous model example pageup pagedown key', 'easy use position fn key', 'previous netbook thing', 'sound speaker', 'netbook speaker quality', 'previous model solution use pair good earbud phone', 'speaker good job asus', 'main point discontent choice', 'windows starter', 'xp home microsoft fault asus', 'reviewer starter', 'interface windows home', 'marginal improvement', 'worth money', 'starter furthermore windows', 'stable fast system limitation term', 'able customize appearance graphic user interface', 'inappropriate netbook netbook need', 'able rid unnecessary embellishment interface screen space screen space', 'windows starter limit regard purpose microsoft', 'money windows home', 'angry inconvenience problem', 'decision microsoft embitter microsoft association asus summary', 'great netbook', 'obvious asus', 'slight valuable improvement netbook result', 'fine product windows starter spoil star']"
"OUT OF THE BOX

I bought the ASUS 1005PE as an upgrade from my ASUS eeepc 2G Surf.  As soon as it arrived, I plugged it in for the recommended eight hours.  I turned it on and was surprised by how slow this 1005PE was compared to the 2G surf.  I thought, this is an upgrade???  Of course, I hadn't yet implemented Turtle James's recommendations.  If you hadn't read his review, it would be well worth your time.

The things that improved performance:

1)  Speed noticeably increased when I got rid of WebStorage.

2)  Speed improved with upgrade to 2 GB RAM.

3)  More improvement using ReadyBoost.

4)  Started using Firefox and surfing has never been better.

Now, my 1005PE is no longer sluggish, thanks to Turtle James.

INSTANT BOOT

Instead of booting the regular way, there is a button for instant boot, which is exactly as it says.  This is supposed to be a quick on for the system to do things like web, photos, Skype.  Of course, not everything boots up.  I cannot use my USB modem.  Only WiFi or wired internet access is possible.

The instant boot screen is very slow and unresponsive.  For something that is supposed to be quick, it is very sluggish.  I'd rather boot the old fashioned way and get the most out of my computer.

OTHER THAN SPEED

Of the aesthetic details, the cover is rubbery.  I'm not sure how much I like that.  At least I can grip it easily.  The inside is glossy and a fingerprint magnet.

The touchpad works but takes a little getting used to.  I found it worked better after I went into the control panel to tweak it.  Still I prefer using a mouse.

The screen is beautiful.  No complaints there.

The sound is not great.  Sounds like a small computer, but it is a small computer so I'm not disappointed.  I'm not planning on using this as my music player.

The computer runs cool, even when I've had it on for hours.  My 2G Surf would heat up.  The 1005PE gets a little warm, but not noticeably so.  I could hold it in my lap without being uncomfortable.

I can usually get about 10 hours before the computer dies out on me.  It's a remarkable battery life, considering what I had on my 2G Surf.

I mostly do web surfing on the netbook and for that, Windows 7 Starter has been all that I need.  I haven't seen any reason to upgrade.

I like being able to restore the system with a touch of a button.  No need to save and then hunt for that recovery disc.

PROS:
+ runs well once the system is tweaked
+ small, lightweight and portable
+ cover is rubbery, resists fingerprints and provides grip
+ beautiful screen
+ netbook doesn't get hot
+ long battery life
+ no need for recovery disc

CONS:
- must upgrade and tweak before using
- inside panels are glossy fingerprint magnets
- sound is weak
- Instant Boot is slow and unresponsive
- Instant Boot will not accept USB modem

Overall, I consider this a great buy, but only after all the tweaking.  If I wanted something to work right out of the box, I would have been disappointed; because it would have been far too sluggish.","['asus pe upgrade asus eeepc surf', 'slow pe', 'upgrade course', 'turtle james recommendation', 'worth time thing', 'performance speed', 'rid webstorage speed', 'upgrade gb ram improvement readyboost', 'long sluggish', 'turtle james instant boot', 'regular way button instant boot', 'quick system thing', 'web photo skype course boot use usb modem wifi wire internet access', 'possible instant boot screen', 'slow unresponsive suppose', 'quick sluggish boot', 'computer speed aesthetic detail', 'glossy fingerprint magnet touchpad work', 'control panel tweak', 'mouse screen', 'beautiful complaint', 'small computer', 'small computer', 'plan music player computer run', 'cool hour surf heat pe', 'hour computer', 'remarkable battery life', 'surf web', 'netbook windows starter need', 'reason upgrade', 'able restore system touch button need', 'hunt recovery disc pros', 'system tweak', 'small lightweight', 'beautiful screen netbook', 'battery life need recovery disc', 'con upgrade tweak', 'panel glossy fingerprint magnet', 'sound weak instant boot', 'slow unresponsive instant boot', 'usb modem overall', 'box disappoint']"
"This is my first laptop and I could not be happier.  With the i5 processor, it is fast and powerful.  Much more so than the desktop it replaces.  The monitor is bright and shows photos very well, very important for me because processing the photos I take is one of the major uses.  The ability to tilt the monitor to the position you prefer helps in this regard.  The 2-year global warranty and the 1-year accidental damage warranty are pluses and indicate the confidence that ASUS has in the quality of their computers.

Update:  I have used the computer now for a month and am still very enthused.  I have edited 100s of photos during this period and pleased with the monitors performance.

A techie friend was who suggested this might be the computer for me, when I told him my requirements.  He said if he were in the market for a new laptop, this is one he would buy.

I am still amazed how fast this computer is compared to my previous computer.

"I have been using it for a few days now. I love Windows 7 (coming from XP) and the laptop overall. It's very quick with Matlab, Word, and whatnot. I will try to keep it free of crappy software and I hope it lasts a long time.

Construction is plastic, but is solid. There is some keyboard flex in the S,D,E key neighborhood. The arrow keys are a bit small and weirdly positioned, the right shift is smaller than the left shift. There is a number keypad, which is nice, but I don't use it. The screen is pretty and glossy (could be good or bad thing, depending on what you do). The webcam works well, but it's only VGA. Speakers are decent, given that it's a laptop, but my definition of decent may differ from yours.

One of the cheapest laptops out there with Core i5 and 1Gb of dedicated video memory + 4Gb RAM + 500Gb drive. It's not compact, but it's not bulky either. Beats the hell out of my old Toshiba Satellite A15 that I had in college. Laptops have come a long way in the past few years.

"I bought this laptop a week ago and it has given me nothing but problems.  It keeps shutting it self off and when I rebut, it has a black screen telling me it was closed down incorrectly.  I called an Asus tech. and they had me put in the rescue disk to reload the OS.  I did.  Well it kept doing the same thing and then it just would not rebut.  Just a solid gray screen it was fried.  I called the tech. who, once again had me reinstall the OS which took over an hour this time.  And, of course, I had to reload my printer etc.  Well, it went black again, shut itself off.  I called Asus and said I want to replace it with another.  They said they don't do that.  Now, mind you, it shut itself down everyday I used the thing.  So I called Amazon and they had UPS pick it up today and I am getting another laptop which won't be an Asus.

"15.6 inch screen, and the size/weight of the laptop is perfect for me - not too large.
Screen is sharp, details, color, and contrast are excellent - even if using outdoors.
The I5 is really fast - cranks up and down depending on the workload.
The laptop is really very quiet, which surprised me.  Some heat produced, but I can work comfortably with it sitting on my lap.
The case, including the navigation pad is slightly patterned - looks nice, has a good solid feel, minimal fingerprints.
The keyboard has a lot of flex, which bothered meet initially.  But I've looked at some other ASUS laptops in the store, they all seem to have a fair amount of flex - maybe it's made that way in case you're banging hard on the keys.  The chiclet keys themselves have a good feel and are well spaced - full numeric keyboard on the side is a plus.
Battery usage can be adjusted - I would say 2 1/2 hours battery time in the performance mode.
Included utilities may or may not be useful, not too much other included software - get rid of the Trend AV package, Norton 360 works well.

"This netbook has a great feature set and works well, despite a few niggling flaws.

PROS: Bright, full resolution screen, great battery life, HD accelerator, bluetooth, smudge-free case, kinda decent speakers, nice touchpad, very light.

CONS: Noisy keyboard, keyboard flex, takes some tweaking to get the Broadcom card to work well, bad speaker placement (under the front), stiff trackpad button.

FINAL THOUGHTS
Other users complain about bloatware and there really isn't all that much.  And like any new computer, it takes awhile to configure it.  I also added an SD card for a little ReadyBoost speed bump and will add another gig of RAM, but when it's in Super Performance mode, it does everything with minimal, if any, hesitation.  I'm hoping the extra RAM will speed things up.

I bought this mostly as a media player and it does that well.  480 Hulu can be twitchy at times but Netflix and Youtube play very well.  It's my first time using Windows 7 Starter and so far I haven't found a real need to upgrade.

The battery lasts for well over 8 hours, which is fantastic.  They keyboard is noisy and flimsy but I can type fairly quickly with it.  Frankly, with the video accelerator and the full screen resolution, it's the netbook I wanted at a very reasonable price.  I can live with its few shortcomings.","['niggle flaw pros', 'bright resolution screen', 'great battery life hd accelerator bluetooth smudge', 'free case', 'decent speaker', 'nice touchpad', 'light cons noisy keyboard keyboard', 'tweak broadcom card work', 'bad speaker placement', 'stiff trackpad button', 'final thoughts user complain bloatware', 'new computer', 'awhile configure', 'sd card', 'readyboost speed bump', 'gig ram', 'super performance mode minimal hesitation hope', 'extra ram speed thing', 'medium player hulu twitchy time netflix youtube play time windows starter', 'real need upgrade battery', 'fantastic keyboard noisy flimsy type', 'video accelerator screen resolution netbook', 'reasonable price']"
"After reading the reviews from other buyers on this site, I wanted to buy one at a store to make sure everything's working before bringing one home.

I'm glad I was prepared by others re: the type of product I was getting.

The playback of youtube files at 720p and 1080p produced crisp, sharp slideshow quality. So the processor cannot handle smooth playback. The cpu usage was at a whopping 100% when trying to play the 1080p vid.

Then again, the screen is so small that 480p is amazing already.

Like some others, I don't like the highly reflective screen, but I understand why a matte screen like the 1005PE wasn't used. The pixels are so small that a matte finish would actually distort the light from the tiny pixels.

On the advice of others I immediately upgraded to a 2gb RAM, so I can't say if it's made a difference or not.

Overall, this lil' guy fits the bill for me for internet browsing, skype, and writing papers.","['review buyer site', 'sure work', 'type product', 'playback youtube file', 'sharp slideshow quality processor', 'smooth playback cpu usage', 'vid screen', 'reflective screen', 'matte screen', 'pe pixel', 'small matte finish', 'light tiny pixel advice', 'upgrade gb ram difference overall lil guy', 'fit bill internet']"
"My first attempt ended with me having to ship the unit back to Amazon because the unit did not have the Broadcom Crystal HD Accelerator.  I too called ASUS to see if they could help but they were of no help what-so-ever.  Bravo, Amazon for excellent customer service!!  Unfortunately, I had to wait almost a month before Amazon had the unit back in stock and I just received my new unit a few days ago.  I must say, I LOVE IT!  I did uninstall some of the bloatware (anything that said Microsoft Office), enabled ReadyBoost with a 4G SD card, updated the Adobe Flash to 10.1 and replaced IE with Firefox (much faster than IE!). I am happy to report that so far I can watch videos and TV episodes without any stuttering. Haven't tried movies yet.

"I live in Japan and wanted a netbook for my regular flights to and from the U.S. The 1005PR seemed ideal, so I purchased one and had it sent to a relative in the U.S. (Most electronic goods can't be shipped out of the U.S.) Naturally, Murphy's Law kicked in and I received one that did not have the Broadcom chipset. The ensuing struggle with ASUS's phone support to get an RMA was so monumentally horrible that it poisoned me against the ASUS brand permanently. (I had to postpone a trip to the States, so, sadly, I fell out of Amazon's 30-day warranty window.) Here's the message I left ASUS on my customer satisfaction survey:

Dealing with ASUS phone support was so unpleasant that, while I think ASUS products are generally of very high quality and have built two pcs with ASUS motherboards and other components, I will never purchase another ASUS product. I bought an ASUS Eee PC 1005PR-PU17-BK that did not have a functioning Broadcom HD chipset. This problem was widespread and well documented by other purchasers on the Amazon and Newegg websites. Amazon even pulled the netbook off its site for a time because of the problem. Regardless, ASUS's phone support reps seemed to have zero knowledge of this, and they did everything they could, including twisting truth into a pretzel, to avoid giving me an RMA. Good going, ASUS.

"With the latest broadcom drivers (3.3.0) and flash software:

pros:

- sleek and well built. Not the thinnest around but the battery is almost flush with the body (not promiscuously hanging in the back as most).
- bright HD screen. You can work as you are used to on a bigger laptop, plenty of room. The fonts are not too small (also can be increased).
- perfect decoding (silky smooth) of 1080p 720p 480p h264 videos files with included  total media theater 3 player and MPC-HC, etc.
- Youtube (windowed) 1080p = ~22 fps, 720p=~22fps
- Youtube (fullscreen) 1080p = ~8 fps, 720p=~12fps. Amazingly, it is still watchable
- youtube (fullscreen with total media theater 3)  1080p, 720p ... silky smooth!. Works from clicking a play icon on the youtube video thumbnails in internet explorer only. 35-60% cpu max in power saving mode for 1080p
- long battery life
- noise cancelling microphones tech (with two microphones)
- great keyboard
- sdcard slot allows the card to be flush with the case

cons:

- webcam could be better in low light but ok in most conditions
- no desktop vsync due to lack of aero in win7 starter => some tearing occur on the desktop. it does not affect playing videos with total media theater 3.
-  touchpad has to be tuned (disable zooming gesture)

"I agree that you should consider waiting before buying the 1005PR. Several people, myself included, are having problems with the Broadcom Crystal HD either not being present or not working.  If you just got yours, check in Device Manager, under Video, Sound, Game Controllers and see if Broadcom Crystal HD is there.  Even if it is, try to play an HD (720P) video from YouTube and see if it stutters or plays smoothly.  I just talked to ASUS and they claim they are unaware of the problem and after I do a complete reinstall, they will send me a RMA to return it, if it still doesn't work.  The 1005PR without the HD is kind of pointless. Oh, and for what it's worth, I don't like the flush mounted track pad, since my finger keeps going off the edge.

"I had a Dell 1011 and a Dell Latitude 2100 before, and I really loved the portability factor of the netbook concept. The thing that bugged me the most is the small screen resolution. And FINALLY Asus comes out with a netbook with a HD screen! I considered this netbook along with Sony's and HP's offers that all came with a 1366x768 screen, and finally settled on the Asus because: Sony's is wayyyyy overpriced, HP has a standard 3 cell battery, the 6 cell sticks out, and Asus' reputation and quality.

Pro:
GREAT textured lid. Its very high end feeling, not glossy.
HD screen. now I can finally do some work without having to scroll every 2 seconds.
Long battery life. I never got 11 hours, but I get 6-7 hours on good brightness and everything enabled. And thats more than enough for me.

I too found out that it is impossible to play Dolby Digital 5.1 AC3 on some H264 Blueray files. I could not believe that when you went to open file and pointed TMT3 to a BD folder it didn't open it. I was very disappointed because if you have to play just the .m2ts you lose the chapters and more importantly any of the forced subs. I all ready own the TMT Extreme and thought I would install it. It plays the movie from the BD folder and also has sound BUT the video playback is not fluid at all, It jerks and studders all over the place. I finally had to do a full F9 reinstall to get the old version TMT3 back to working. What a rip off if they try to sell us an upgrade for 99 bucks. I think that the ASUS 1005PR is a great idea but I am already out 425 dollars for it, plus 80 dollars for 2Gigs of ram (what a rip off cause they should have put it in or at least offered it as upgrade since it is painfully slow with out it and after upgrade you are left with a useless 1Gig stick.), so for 500 dollars I might as well wait till some one else offers a comparable net book that will play real HD content.

"I grew up on PCs, converted via a Macbook Pro to Mac in 2005, and am now converting back to PCs because of this little netbook. Upgraded to 2GB RAM, de-bloated, and stripped down to the basics this computer runs like a dream and can handle a pretty demanding load. Like other reviewers have said, when you get this clean all the bloat off the system, install an extra GB of RAM, and upgrade to Home Premium. I do anthropological fieldwork and this is great for working on Office, uploading raw audio files, storing audio and video for entertainment, and uploading pictures and viewing them. I even uploaded HD video from my camcorder and edited it while in Africa. The last time I did fieldwork with my Mac it overheated and the battery broke. It also slugged through 50 minutes of battery life. This computer, however, charges very fast and stays charged for 10-12 hours. Even after 9 months, I'm still getting 8-9 hours out of this. It runs cool, runs long, and never crashes.

My only complaint is in the actual structure of the computer. Why can't ASUS sell a ""premier"""" line of netbooks made from aluminum that don't feel so cheap?

"First let me say that the netbook looks great and is really light. Even with a padded sleeve, this takes up much less room in my bag and is really light.

I read other reviews where fingerprint smudges were mentioned. This definitely happens, and because it's so shiny the smudges are obvious, but they easily wipe off.

Beyond the appearance, the keyboard is nice - actual raised keys that are satisfying to touch. Unfortunately, on a couple of occasions, the keys did not seem to catch up with me as I typed (I type quite quickly) and that meant that I had to go back and revise many words that were misspelled. I like the mouse touchpad and buttons (actually one button with two sides - nice), but it takes a little getting used to.
The screen is bright and crisp and I was pleasantly surprised at the resolution quality.

The netbook comes with 1GB of RAM and I upgraded almost immediately as this was simply not enough and I was not happy with how slow programs and websites loaded. For $60 I bought a 2GB memory card and found it pretty easy to swap in. Note: There is only one card slot, so to upgrade, you will need to get a 2GB card and not an additional 1GB card.
I bought an external ASUS DVD read/write drive for $72 which works well but ends up being a little bulky to carry around once it is in it's case. This is the opposite of what I was trying to do by adding a netbook to my laptop collection.
I have not upgraded to full windows 7 yet but am likely to do that as the starter version of the operating system is very basic and limiting.

By the time you buy the memory card, CD/DVD drive and upgrade to windows you could easily have a richer function laptop (or an ipad and a couple of hundred dollars to spend on content) so I'm not sure I would recommend this to everyone.

The one significant problem that I have encountered is with the headset output. I was trying to use the netbookch a movie on a plane and could not hear anything. Even though I was using noise isolating headphones, the output from the netbook was really low and made it basically useless for media viewing in public (i.e. with a headset).

Overallthis is not a bad netbook and is reasonable value for money but beware of the sound limitations and the extra costs for upgrades.","['netbook look', 'great light', 'room bag', 'review fingerprint smudge', 'shiny smudge', 'wipe appearance keyboard', 'nice actual raise key', 'couple occasion key catch type type', 'revise word misspell', 'mouse touchpad button', 'button side', 'bright crisp', 'resolution quality netbook', 'gb ram upgrade', 'happy slow program website load', 'gb memory card', 'note card slot upgrade need gb card', 'additional gb card', 'external asus dvd', 'drive work end', 'netbook laptop collection upgrade window', 'likely starter version', 'basic limit time', 'memory card cd dvd drive upgrade window', 'rich function laptop ipad couple dollar', 'significant problem encounter headset output', 'netbookch movie plane', 'noise isolate headphone output netbook', 'useless medium view', 'public headset overallthis', 'bad netbook', 'reasonable value money beware', 'sound limitation', 'extra cost upgrade']"
"I just received this 1005PR yesterday morning, and after reading these reviews here, I checked in my 'Device Manager' list of this unit and confirmed that I DO have an installed Broadcom CrystalHD Video Decoder listed under 'Sound, Video, and Game Controllers' category, and my HD plays smoothly on the included Arcsoft Media Player, but does not play sound, I assume since my sound tracks are in Dobly Digital and this trial version wont let you have all features. The Windows Media Player that is included with Windows 7 Starter doesn't seem to be playing the h.264 video, as it does try to play, but the video is all garbled up and unwatchable. HD on websites using Flash plays fine. But DO upgrade Adobe Flash Player as another reviewer here stated.

 I originally had purchased a 1005HA a few months ago and wound up giving it to my wife (she doesn't care about HD) and got this 1005PR instead and I really like it so far. Except out of the box, I'm not really too happy with their entire software package / bundle. It does run really slow. You have to do all of the standard Win 7 tweaks on it to get the performance back up to par. I had put an SSD drive in the 1005HA I gave to my wife and am really happy with it, so I got another SSD drive to put in this 1005PR but just haven't put it in yet, as I want to make sure I am really happy with the entire unit before I void the warranty just yet and disassemble this thing. I put the 2GB stick of RAM in and it is performing pretty good right now, but I know with the SSD drive installed it will do a lot better. I tested several video files in full 1920 x 1080p and some video cam files in 1440 x 1080p and they play fine in that trial version of Arcsoft Media whatever-it's-called 3 thing, but the sound doesn't work (since it's the trial version doesn't play Dolby copyrighted audio), but I tried these same h.264 video clips using Windows Media Player which comes with this Win 7 starter, and like I said the video is all garbled and unwatchable. I am going to use one of my Windows Anytime Upgrade license keys and upgrade it to full Win 7 Pro which should have the fully functional Windows Media Player and I know it has a very nice h.264 Mpeg 4 decoder built-in so we'll see how that works. I am going to image this OS onto my SSD drive first and then upgrade that one to my Win 7 Pro version. For now I'm going to install my Power DVD 9 Ultra (although it's h.264 decoder is not as smooth as Windows Media Player that comes in Win 7 Pro) and I'll see how that goes.

 As far as the Arcsoft Media Center solution which is included in the software bundle goes, I'm not a big fan of bundled software that is not fully-functional and didn't ship with the laptop in it's fully-functional state. This for some reason irritates me whenever I buy a new computer and none of the included software just simply works forever. I usually get mad and don't even try it too much and uninstall all the trials because I already own programs that usually work better than the trials they've packaged into the software bundle. But ever since I used the latest Windows Media Player (12 I think it is), that shipped on my Win 7 Pro for my other Lenovo Thinkpad I fell in love with their new h.264 decoder because it plays HD smooth as silk, and all my Dish Network Satellite rips are usually broadcast with h.264 compression. It is even smoother than the Power DVD 9 Ultra one by a noticable amount. So my preference as far as a media player would be to try and get Windows Media Player to work. It only ships on the new Windows 7 OSs, and I think the Win 7 Starter might not have the full featured version because like I said, it looks all garbled on this new Netbook. I will post an update when I get my upgrade key installed and I'm running the full Win 7 Pro and post back about whether the h.264 Mpeg4 works at that time.

 But all in all, I am very happy with this new netbook since I don't feel like I'm working through a keyhole, because with the hi-resolution panel I have plenty of screen real estate. The other 1005HA I gave to my wife, even after adjusting the DPI and skrinking everything as small as I could in the software and registry settings, in the end it was still just a 1024x600 panel. This new hi-res panel in this 1005PR makes me feel a lot more at home since I come from a T61p Thinkpad with a 1680x1050 res panel and with all that real estate, I just couldn't get used to the limited resolution that came on netbooks, but this new netbook is the answer to the problem, the reason why I never had wanted to get a netbook before, was the pathetic resolutions they traditionally had. But with this one, I could use this all day, except the processor is still a bit slow for developers as compiling code it is way too slow with the atom processor. But if I have internet connection available, I can still connect to my server at home and do my dev work on the netbook, upload the code to the server, and then have it compile the code, so this is not a deal-breaker, just a small hassle. If they could get these compact netbooks to have real processors with Core2 Duo or Quad even, that would be the bomb. But for now, this little 1005PA is quite the little machine for what it is, and the battery life is amazing. I also bought a second battery for a spare and that's one thing the Thinkpad T61p could ever touch was it could only last maybe close to 2 hrs on battery but this 1005PR lasts more like 8-9 hours on a single battery, and I have 2 of them, so I just leave the charger at home. I do wish I could get a cradle charger though, to charge the batteries without having to put them into the netbook to charge. If somebody made a cradle charger for these and other netbook models, I think it would be a hit sale. Maybe I should send this idea to some Chinese manufacturing company, I'm sure they would jump on the chance.

But I would recommend this netbook to anyone who wants more screen real estate, and the ability to watch HD content since that is where all TV has moved and is still moving. If your netbook did not come with the Broadcom hardware or is not functioning according to the item description, then simply contact Amazon and make them send you the correct model as it was advertised, since it says right in the item description that it has this hardware. Let THEM fight with Asus since they are the big retailer with the strong arm. Amazon has been very reasonable to me as I've bought lots of stuff from them over the years, and they've never been unfair with me, and their return policies are very accomodating, almost as good as Costco's.

I'm giving it 4 stars because the current software package ought to be optimized more for performance because the bloatware makes it run slow on the Atom processor and this may deteer the average consumer who does not know how to reduce the bloatware on their own accord. Once bloatware is removed, and performance settings are optimized, and 2GB RAM is installed, then this machine performs pretty good and works decent for having an Atom processor. Developers typically tend to forget that more code is not always better. The code needs to be sized and taylored for the hardware it is running on. On, my other netbook, I still run Windows Aero Desktop theme and it works fine, but I DO turn off much of the animation in the Visual Settings, like animate menus, and fade or slide menus, etc, etc. As soon as I do the upgrade on this netbook to Win 7 Pro, I will also turn on Aero just because I like the semi transparent taskbar look and color, but I will also disable most of all the animation effects as I did on my wife's netbook. And if you go to the startup tab in msconfig what is all that junk that they think needs to run at startup? This is what I'm talking about. You can still get the pretty looks without slowing the thing down to a noticable amount. It's like they think the Atom processor is not going to go any slower, yet they run all the same stuff as the laptops they sell with the Core2 Duo processors and stuff. But other than that, so far, it looks like a decent netbook.","['review check device manager list unit', 'broadcom crystalhd video decoder list', 'sound video game controllers category hd play', 'arcsoft media player play', 'sound track', 'digital trial version', 'windows media player', 'windows starter play video', 'video garble', 'unwatchable hd website flash play', 'fine upgrade adobe flash player reviewer state', 'wife care hd', 'happy entire software package bundle run', 'slow standard', 'tweak performance par ssd drive', 'ssd drive pr', 'sure happy entire unit void warranty disassemble thing gb', 'pretty good right', 'ssd drive instal lot', 'test video file video cam file play', 'fine trial version arcsoft media', 'sound work trial version play dolby copyright audio', 'video clip windows media player', 'upgrade license key upgrade', 'functional windows media player', 'nice mpeg decoder', 'image os ssd drive upgrade', 'pro version', 'install power dvd ultra decoder', 'smooth windows media player', 'arcsoft media center solution', 'software bundle', 'big fan bundle software', 'functional ship laptop', 'functional state reason irritate', 'new computer', 'uninstall trial program', 'trial package software bundle', 'late windows media player', 'pro lenovo thinkpad fall', 'new decoder play hd', 'smooth silk dish network satellite rip', 'smooth power dvd ultra', 'noticable preference', 'medium player', 'windows media player work ship', 'new windows os', 'new netbook post update upgrade key instal run', 'pro post mpeg work time', 'happy new netbook', 'work keyhole hi resolution panel plenty screen', 'real estate', 'dpi skrinke', 'small software registry setting end panel', 'new hi re panel pr', 'lot home', 'thinkpad re panel', 'real estate', 'new netbook', 'problem reason', 'netbook pathetic resolution', 'day processor bit', 'slow developer compile code way', 'slow atom processor internet connection', 'server home dev work netbook upload code server compile code', 'small hassle', 'compact netbook', 'real processor core duo quad bomb', 'machine battery life', 'spare thing thinkpad touch', 'hrs battery pr', 'hour single battery', 'charger home', 'cradle charger charge battery', 'netbook charge', 'cradle charger netbook model', 'idea chinese', 'real estate ability', 'hd content tv', 'broadcom hardware function accord item description', 'contact amazon', 'model advertise', 'item description hardware', 'fight asus', 'big retailer', 'strong arm amazon', 'lot stuff year', 'unfair return policy', 'current software package', 'optimize performance bloatware', 'slow atom processor deteer average consumer', 'bloatware accord bloatware', 'performance setting optimize gb ram instal machine', 'pretty good work', 'atom processor developer', 'code need', 'taylore hardware run netbook run windows aero desktop theme work', 'fine turn animation visual settings', 'animate menus fade slide menu etc etc', 'upgrade netbook', 'pro turn aero', 'semi transparent taskbar look color', 'animation effect wife netbook startup tab msconfig junk', 'need run startup talk', 'pretty look', 'slow thing', 'atom processor', 'slow run stuff laptop', 'core duo processor stuff', 'decent netbook']"
"I am a full time consultant and spent a lot of time in Dec 2010 looking for a laptop that would mostly be a desktop replacement, but that I would also travel with to client sites.  I have had this machine for over 20 months and it has done a great job.  I don't do a lot of heavy computing, but when I do, the core i5 is surprisingly adequate. I don't do heavy graphics, but it is supposed to be adequate for moderate gaming.  I bought this over the more expensive bamboo model because the latter did not upgrade to 8G ram, and the lights indicating things like whether you are plugged in, wireless is running etc were hidden from view. A small thing, but super annoying to have to lift up the computer to see these lights.

Pros:
1. amazing value for money
2. very capable for working IT consultant not doing super heavy computing
3. upgradeable to 8G ram
4. Small enough to use on a plane in economy seating
5. can do moderate gaming
6. backed by Asus 2 year guarantee and I can have it serviced at my local shop where I bought it - an Asus qualified shop.
7. The mouse gestures are really handy, especially for scrolling
8. Very reliable, have not had any problems to speak of
9. Windows 7 and DisplayLink make it very easy to have multiple monitors. I currently use 4, including the laptop screen.

Caveats:
1. not very light, if you want to travel a lot
2. battery life very poor; I get by with an extra battery, but even that only just lasts 4-6 hrs.
3. mouse pad not super smooth or responsive
4. no backlit keyboard

I can probably use this machine for another year or two if need be, but I am shopping around a bit, hoping that Asus will come out with a comparable model with the Ivy Bridge Core i7 chip with flash drive to make things more snappy. Some Ultrabooks have come out recently in this category, but I don't need to pay the premium for super small and light.

This would be a great machine to pick up used, if you can live with the caveats and want Win 7 rather than Win 8.  I might be selling mine before too long ;-)","['time consultant', 'lot time dec look laptop desktop replacement travel client site machine month', 'great job lot', 'adequate heavy graphic suppose', 'expensive bamboo model upgrade ram', 'plug wireless', 'etc hide view', 'small thing', 'light pro amazing value money', 'capable work consultant', 'upgradeable ram', 'small use plane economy seat', 'asus year', 'service local shop', 'shop mouse gesture', 'reliable problem', 'windows displaylink', 'easy multiple monitor', 'laptop screen caveat', 'travel lot battery life', 'poor extra battery', 'hrs mouse', 'super smooth responsive backlit keyboard', 'machine year need shop bit hope asus', 'comparable model ivy bridge core chip flash drive thing snappy ultrabooks', 'category need pay premium', 'super small light', 'great machine']"
"I got this laptop because it was on sale and it looks very light and sleek, and I'm very surprised of its durability of performances in addition to the appearance.
After 3 years, besides occasional crash (which usually happens when I have 50 Chrome tabs+other applications open...), it runs smooth and fast just like the first day I got it. I've replaced the power adapter once when it broken after 18 months, but never had any problem other than that, and the battery that still holds a strong 6-8 hour on regular balanced battery setting (not power saving).
The other drawback for this laptop is probably the monitor. The resolution is pretty crisp and clear, but my eyes get tired after looking at it for too long. When I use it at home, I always use an external display just to reduce the eye strain.

"First impression:
Started great right of the box, has a really glossy screen which looks really great when its off, sometimes the screen creates some problems thought due to reflection. After doing its own setup, works great.

After 3 months of use, here are some pros and cons

Pros:
Lightweight
Does not heat up due to charging
Has nifty little button on left top corner that turns limited applications on (some linux thing) in as little as 5 seconds. So when you are really crunched on time, its a great handy tool. It lets u surf web, chat, etc. The most useful functionality of laptop in my view
Keyboard absolutely great for the size. (full size)

Cons:
Once my fan started creating loud noise and would not go off till I turned it off. Dont know what caused it but it just happened once. So am ok with it.
Will be sluggish at time (of course its a dual core not a quad).
The webcam is uselessly low resolution.
The startup webcam login is equally annoying as it takes longer to login that way than just typing in the password.

So all in all, its a good laptop to carry around and use basic applications but if you need performance, look for something else (maybe Dell alienware; hear that they are great performance wise)","['great right box glossy screen look', 'great screen', 'reflection setup work', 'great month use', 'pro con pro lightweight heat charge nifty', 'application linux thing', 'crunch time', 'great handy tool', 'surf web', 'useful functionality laptop view keyboard', 'great size size', 'con fan', 'loud noise till', 'ok sluggish time course dual core quad webcam', 'low resolution startup webcam login', 'login way type password good laptop', 'basic application need performance look', 'dell alienware', 'great performance wise']"
"I have very mixed feelings about this laptop.

Pros:

* Battery life really is very long so long as you're not watching HD video.

* Has performed reliably since I bought it

Negatives:

* Minor: Charger is a bit heavy (if you need to carry it around). Turbo33 toggle needs a restart to take effect. The first time I turned it on it wanted to burn recovery discs. This required 5 or 6 discs and the unit doesn't even have a burner. There was no option to save .iso images instead. Why not just put these discs in the box, Asus? Loaded with crapware out of the box. I spent a good hour or two removing it all. No Windows CD (I have an external drive I could use it with) so doing a clean install wasn't possible

* Medium: In my unit the HD clicks frequently. I discovered this was due to the hard drive parking heads every few seconds. The HD is rated for 600K load cycle, and this would easily have been exceeded after 1yr of use if I hadn't found a tool called ""QuietHDD""""","['feeling laptop', 'pro battery life', 'hd video', 'negative minor charger bit', 'heavy need', 'turbo toggle need restart effect time', 'burn recovery disc', 'disc unit burner option', 'iso image', 'disc box asus load crapware box', 'good hour', 'windows cd external drive use', 'clean install', 'possible medium unit hd click', 'hd rate load cycle', 'yr use']"
"I have had this computer for about a year and have by and large been very happy with it.  The battery life is great and using it for classes 8 hours a day without a charger is a huge plus.  I am also able to play some games, but can't have huge expectations for graphics (usually have to run it on the lowest settings).  Now for the complaints:  Build quality is just ok, there are screws on the bottom that come repeatedly loose, and these are the screws that hold the screen to the laptop base.  Keyboard has some flex and the keys themselves seem loose and noisy. My biggest gripe though is that after a year of windows my computed has inevitable become bogged down, and it is time for a reinstallation.  However, ASUS doesn't provide you the a copy of windows to reinstall.  You have to pay $50.00 for a recovery DVD (not to mention a ridiculous $9.00 for S&H).  If I have known this in the beginning, I would not have gotten this laptop.","['computer year', 'large happy battery life', 'great class hour day charger', 'able play game', 'huge expectation graphic', 'low setting complaint', 'quality ok screw', 'loose screw hold screen laptop base keyboard', 'loose noisy', 'big gripe year window', 'inevitable bogge time reinstallation asus', 'copy window reinstall pay recovery dvd']"
"I've been in the market for a portable computer I could get work done on.  I'm a web developer, and I need a device that supports OpenCL, which somewhat limited my selection to computers with discrete graphics.  I thought about stepping up to a computer with a 2010 Core processor (Core i3, or i5), but the were always out of my price range when paired with a decent graphics card, or had sub standard battery performance.

Pros:
So I ended up with this computer.  So far after a week, I love it.  It works, the keyboard is comfortable, the touch pad required some getting used to but I adapted to it quickly.  The battery life has been incredible even on turbo with the graphics card on it will make it though most of a day of work without charging.  With the card off, and with turbo disabled it lasts for the bus ride into work, a full day of work, and the ride home, which is what I wanted and needed since I consider that time on the bus as potentially useful, and so far it has been.  If nothing else I get to go over scripts and read books while I ride, sometimes I put in actual work too.

Cons:
There is a screen flicker.  This is generally when the graphics card is switching.  You can control this by setting the Control Panel up correctly.  If you don't know what's going on, when you unplug it the screen will dim, and after a few minutes the screen will go black then come back on.  This is the computer switching off the Nvidia 210 to the Intel chipset's 4500HD which is far less powerful, but relatively power efficient, which happens after 15 minutes as configured out of the box in the OS.  It also tends to happen when waking up from sleep.

My only other real complaint has to do with the turbo mode which requires you to restart the computer.  On days where I know that I won't be in front of a plug for awhile I turn it off before I head out the door.  Otherwise I just leave it on.  I've managed to get 7 hours with turbo on, and the battery wasn't out of juice, so it's not much of a problem...

Other than that it's the nicest laptop in the house by quite a large margin.  Most of our other devices are at least 5 years old, heavy, don't do what I need, and last maybe an hour off the plug, so this computer has been a breath of fresh air.

The speakers are surprisingly loud for the size, they positively beat up my wife's HP laptop, even if they don't have impressive bass.

The screen is glossy, but I can still read it even in direct sunlight if I crank up the brightness.  Color is pretty darn good, and the vertical viewing angles are good considering it has a TN panel and all.

My other real complaint is that the inside of the computer (the deck, and bezel around the screen) show dust like no one's business.  I'm almost wishing I'd shelled out the extra 20 bucks for the silver version of the laptop.  As it is, I've learned to keep a micro fiber cloth in my computer bag, but it does sometimes bug me.

Otherwise this has been one of the best purchasing decisions I've made in a while.  The computer has the right mix of performance, portability, and battery life to meet all my needs.

updated: 4/10/2013:  This computer died in November.  The side vent fan became jammed, and the system overheated.  This wasn't user serviceable, and trying to pop the bottom of the case off became an exercise in extreme frustration that lead to breaking several of the plastic clips which held the bottom assembly to the top.  So serviceability and DIY repair ended up being the downfall of the system.  Without being able to clean out the gunk the system died.  Other than that the computer itself did reasonably, the hard drive died after 15 months, and was replaced by a SSD (which was a massive upgrade that took a lot of the sting out of loosing the HDD), the plastic around the keyboard broke after about a year and a half, although it was a minor annoyance.  Still overall given the relatively short lifetime the system I'd have to say it wasn't a great purchase, even if it did adequately meet my needs during the time it was with me.","['portable computer work web developer need device support opencl', 'limit selection computer discrete graphic', 'step computer core processor core price range pair', 'decent graphic card sub', 'standard battery performance', 'pro end computer', 'work keyboard', 'comfortable touch', 'battery life', 'incredible turbo graphic card day work charge card turbo', 'work day work', 'time bus', 'actual work', 'con screen flicker', 'graphic card switch control', 'control panel', 'unplug screen dim minute screen', 'computer switch nvidia intel chipset hd', 'minute configure box os', 'wake sleep', 'real complaint turbo mode', 'restart computer day', 'plug awhile', 'head door', 'manage hour turbo battery juice problem', 'nice laptop house', 'device year', 'old heavy need', 'hour plug computer breath', 'fresh air speaker', 'loud size', 'wife hp laptop', 'impressive bass screen glossy', 'direct sunlight crank brightness color', 'pretty darn good vertical', 'angle good', 'tn panel', 'real complaint', 'computer deck bezel screen dust', 'extra buck silver version laptop', 'micro fiber cloth computer bag bug good', 'decision computer', 'mix performance portability battery life meet need update computer', 'november vent fan', 'system overheat user', 'extreme frustration lead', 'plastic clip hold assembly serviceability diy repair end downfall system', 'able clean gunk system', 'hard drive', 'massive upgrade', 'loose hdd plastic keyboard', 'minor annoyance overall', 'short lifetime system', 'great purchase', 'need time']"
"My favorite thing about this computer is it's size. Something I didn't think about before I bought it was that it would be really easy to curl op on the couch and cradle the computer between my legs or on my stomach or something. It's just really easy to maneuver physically. And I love how lightweight it is. The only other laptop I had before I got this little guy was an ibook g4 that I received as a graduation present. It was great and gorgeous and very cool and all that, but it didn't really function as a portable computer because in those days laptops were HEAVY, man. Plus no wireless internet. This is like the opposite of that. it's so light I can carry it and my notebook and stuff around in a shoulder bag all day and not really care. It's pretty darn fast on the internet, if you have a good connection. Sometimes, however, it takes forever to get on the login page of a public network, but I think that might just be the network. It's great that it comes with free online storage, although I don't really have enough stuff on here to warrant using it yet. At first the screen and font does seem awfully small, but I really got used to it and the touch pad has little zoom shortcuts so it's easy to do that if you can't see something. This is coming from a college student who has to read a ton of online articles, by the way. When I use my boyfriends laptop now which has like a 17 inch screen or something it feels disquietingly huge. The battery life is awesome, too, although I don't think it's always 11 hours like it says. Maybe if you have it on sleep a lot. But it's still really long, just as good as a lot of smart phones. So anyway, I love this little guy, and I use it way more than I thought I would. I'm actually kind of becoming a computer person now.","['favorite thing computer size', 'easy curl op couch cradle computer leg stomach', 'lightweight laptop', 'guy ibook', 'present great gorgeous', 'cool function', 'portable computer day laptop', 'heavy man', 'wireless internet', 'notebook stuff shoulder bag day care', 'pretty darn', 'fast internet good connection', 'login page', 'public network', 'free online storage stuff warrant screen font', 'zoom shortcut', 'college student', 'ton online article way use boyfriend laptop', 'inch screen', 'huge battery life awesome', 'sleep lot', 'long good lot smart phone', 'guy use way', 'kind computer person']"
"I purchased the Asus 1005PE-MU27 netbook last week and also ordered the 2gb Kingston memory upgrade card (do not order the one suggested by Amazon, it is the wrong size).  Many people have complained about Windows 7 starter, but I expected it to be a simple operating system to run basic needs such as web-surfing, instant messaging, Skype, youtube, etc.  It does the job well! I am very satisfied with the performance and highly recommend those with a little less patience to go ahead and upgrade to the 2gb RAM.  It's easy to install (unplug charger & battery, remove screw, remove old 1gb ram at an angle and insert new 2gb RAM.  Upon start up, press F2 to enter bios and ensure computer recognizes new memory - all done!).  I had no problems and read the reviews on amazon's website to get it done and i'm a newb with computers!  Here are the major pros & cons I found:

PROS:
- easy to use, light-weight, great travel-use.
- perfect sized keyboard, not too small.
- fast start-up
- Asus express includes instant msg, skype, internet, games.
- I bought the blue netbook and LOVE the color.  It's royal blue!

CONS:
- battery life states 11 hours, I only get about 6hrs and have already dimmed the screen.
- 1gb RAM is too slow for me, upgrade to 2gb for an extra $30 bucks.  You can run more programs w/o the lag.
- finger-print magnet! Better have some clean hands when handling this netbook!

Basically, for the price ($314.99), this netbook is definitely worth the money.

"I just received this netbook a few days ago.. I had the same model with XP that was about 2 years old and quit working. I liked my old ASUS and used it a great deal.. Thought it quit a little before it's time though.. I can't say i'm real impressed with Windows 7 Starter.. It seems real choppy and unsmooth.. Maybe if I bump up the ram it might help.. The e-mail program is something to be desired.. I guess i'm an old diehard Outlook Express user for e-mail and sending photos.. I do have one desktop that is running Windows 7 home and that seems a little better.. For a netbook, I think XP was a better choice. With this one, Start up time is horrible.  Also took a few hours to remove all the free preloaded garbage they install.. In my opinion, i'm not seeing a real advantage to owning this over a regular laptop.  Maybe if you travel quite a bit it would be nice because it's light weight.. The screen is pretty small but it's a netbook..  I do have to give Amazon a big thumbs up, as it arrived way before expected.  Bottom line: maybe ok for everyday e-mailing and surfing, but you can get a laptop for just a little more money and I think most would be happier with a bigger screen, bigger keyboard, and also a faster, smoother operating system.. I would stay with XP, but we have to keep up with the changing times. Soon it will not be supported and Windows 7 will be the main choice.  Unless you're netbook has XP, I would probably keep looking for something other than Windows 7 Starter on a netbook..","['netbook day', 'model xp year', 'old asus', 'windows starter', 'real choppy unsmooth', 'bump ram', 'program desire guess', 'old diehard outlook express user', 'photo desktop run windows home', 'time horrible', 'garbage install opinion', 'real advantage', 'own regular laptop', 'travel bit', 'nice light weight screen', 'pretty small netbook amazon', 'big thumb', 'happy big screen', 'big keyboard', 'system stay xp', 'support windows', 'main choice netbook xp', 'windows starter netbook']"
"I just purchased this netbook after my previous Asus (the dependable S101) died b/c the screen was damaged by my own carelessness.  So with that in mind, here's my quick take on the 1005PE MU27 model, which I received yesterday.

Pros:
- Nice feel of the keyboard.  Firm and the spacing between the keys did not affect my typing in any way.
- Attractive cover (I bought the blue colored unit) and look to the machine.
- Fairly painless installation.  The first boot took about 10 min or so, and updating the latest files for Windows 7 starter took about 30 min, not too bad.
- Based on the 1GB ram usage, surfing the web was a breeze.  Watching videos on youtube or playing flash-based games all was fine.  But at times I did notice some hiccups when many programs were running so I opted to upgrade to 2GB (see below edit for info).
- Battery life was very very decent.  On a full charge on the high performance mode I managed about 7-8 hours.
- Quick charge time for battery.
- Very nice touchpad.  Very responsive.
- Great price point for people looking to do very basic stuff on the computer.

Mehs:
- Screen resolution was ok.  Not really up to part with the higher end counterparts.
- Camera is standard 0.3Mb quality
- Unit is not as 'sleek' compared to my old S-101, which was definitely lighter, more slender, and didn't feel as 'bulky' of sorts vs the 1005PE
- Click button below touch pad a bit clunky.

Cons:
- Windows 7 starter blows.  It's fine if you're just going to use this netbook to do basic stuff like surf the web, send emails, or play games on facebook.  But not recommended if you're looking to do more extensive things with the netbook.
- Did I tell you Windows 7 blows?  Serious lack of customization.  It's lame that you can't even change your desktop wallpaper without downloading some other app to circumvent the problem.  Dumb you can't personalize fonts etc.
- Does not include even a basic cloth cover for the netbook.  Even in my previous S101 unit they included at least a cheap little cover for the netbook.
- Finger print magnet.  Better have clean hands when holding this laptop!
- Feels kind of heavy.  It looks small, but weighs more than you think.  Definitely outweighs my old S101 by a fair margin.  (And boots a bit slower than my old S101, though my old OS was XP, which I still think was great to use).

Summary
- Great computer for price conscious folks
- Great computer for people not looking to do much more than just surf the web, send emails, do basic stuff like type papers etc.
- Is just fine if you can live with the (many) bare-bones limitations of Windows 7 starter.
- Won't blow you away, but is a decent all around machine at a reasonable price point

**EDIT 6/25/10**

I would also like to point out that I decided to upgrade the RAM on this netbook.  It was partially because I wasn't too thrilled with the performance of Windows 7 (I still ABSOLUTELY HATE the lack of customization options on the starter OS.  COME ON MICROSOFT!!!).  But also I noticed sometimes things got a bit sluggish when I ran multiple programs.

Anyway I just want to point out I bought the 2GB RAM from Kingston = Kingston ValueRAM 2 GB 800MHz PC2-6400 DDR2 CL5 SODIMM Notebook Memory (KVR800D2S5/2G) (Link Below):

http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00102A066/ref=cm_cr_mts_prod_img

I would strongly recommend anybody who wants a bit more out of this netbook to consider upgrading the memory.  I noticed a nice difference in performance after my upgrade.  VERY VERY HAPPY that I did so.

For those of you who aren't aware - the Asus memory comes with 1GB RAM that's upgradable to 2GB.  There's only 1 memory slot so you will have to take out the old chip.

To do so - (REMEMBER UNPLUG COMPUTER AND REMOVE BATTERY BEFORE STARTING THIS PROCESS)
1. Remove the single screw from the memory casing on the bottom of th netbook.
2. Remove the old chip (carefully since it comes out at an angle)
3. Insert new chip carefully (again at an angle somewhat) and make sure it snaps into place.
4. Put battery back on, turn on computer, press F2 upon powering up to get into bios and make sure computer recognizes memory.
5. All done.

- Note the kingston memory chip had none of the issues that other users previously noted with other brands.  At least I didn't experience any hiccups.  2GB does make a difference.","['purchase netbook', 'previous asus', 'screen damage carelessness mind', 'quick pe mu model', 'keyboard firm', 'unit look machine', 'painless installation boot', 'min update', 'late file windows starter', 'bad base gb ram usage surf web breeze', 'video youtube play flash base game', 'fine time notice hiccup program run opt upgrade gb edit info battery life', 'decent charge high performance mode manage hour', 'quick charge time battery', 'nice touchpad responsive', 'great price point people', 'basic stuff computer mehs screen resolution ok high end counterpart camera', 'standard mb quality unit sleek', 'bulky sort vs pe click button touch', 'bit clunky', 'con windows starter blow', 'basic stuff', 'surf web', 'email play game facebook', 'extensive thing netbook', 'windows blow lack customization lame', 'desktop wallpaper download app circumvent problem', 'dumb personalize font etc', 'basic cloth', 'previous unit', 'netbook finger print magnet', 'clean hand hold laptop', 'heavy look', 'old fair', 'boot bit', 'slow old old os xp', 'great use summary', 'great computer price', 'conscious folk', 'great computer people', 'surf web', 'basic stuff', 'type paper etc', 'bare bone limitation windows starter', 'decent machine', 'reasonable price point edit', 'upgrade ram netbook', 'performance windows', 'lack customization option starter os', 'microsoft notice thing', 'bit sluggish run', 'multiple program', 'gb ram kingston kingston valueram gb mhz pc ddr cl sodimm notebook memory kvr link http www amazon com gp product ref', 'bit netbook', 'upgrade memory notice', 'nice difference performance upgrade', 'happy aware asus memory', 'gb ram', 'upgradable gb memory slot', 'old chip', 'unplug computer', 'screw memory case th netbook', 'old chip', 'angle insert', 'new chip', 'sure snap place battery', 'computer press power bio', 'sure computer', 'memory note kingston memory chip issue user', 'note brand experience hiccup gb difference']"
"Don't expect much from this computer.  It's ok for surfing the web in a limited manner (if I have more than about 3-4 windows open at a time it starts to get pretty sluggish).  It will probably do what you want it to but it gets around to it in its own sweet time.  Sometimes it completely freezes up and CPU usage leaps to 100% for no apparent reason.  However, it usually WILL figure out what ever its problem is and start working again after a minute or two.

Basically, this computer acts about like the 3 or 4 year-old computer you are probably replacing.  Based on other reviews I just went ahead and ordered the 2GB RAM chip.  I can't even IMAGINE trying to use this computer without it!  If it's as slow this slow with 2GB of RAM I don't even know how Asus can get them off the shelves with only 1 GB of RAM.

Despite the fact that others seem to have no problems streaming video, I have never been able to stream video in anything that I would consider a satisfactory manner.  If you are ok with watching stuff in 30 second to 1 minute bursts (and then waiting for 30 seconds or so while it buffers) then you will probably be completely satisfied with it.  Me, I find that annoying.  Also, sometimes if you pause the video (to allow it to buffer) it won't UN-pause and you have to completely reload the page, negating any forward progress you may have made.

A big selling point for me was the web storage but this proved to be VERY time consuming- I left my computer alone for a full day (plugged in so it was at peak performance) and I only have about 20GB out of ~120GB backed up.  I know that my connection speed had nothing to do with this as I could stream and transfer data with my other computer at a reasonable rate (sorry, I don't know specifics but it was fast enough that it seemed acceptable to me).  Also, the web storage only lasts for a year, after which point you have to pay (can't remember how much, only that it was more than I was willing to pay!) so I decided it made more sense to just buy an external hard drive.

A few technical things that I find particularly frustrating:

The touch pad is super sensitive, which actually ends up being a huge pain in the ass because just having your thumb hover over the touch pad constantly causes the computer to jump to wherever your curser happens to be on the page.  Not exactly a huge deal but if you aren't paying attention you type whole sentances in the middle of your paragraph so it can be annoying.

The shift bar is really small and that is a GIANT inconvenience because you instead hit the page up button at the same time, which selects all the text between where you are typing and the top of the page, resulting in you deleting the entire page of typing.  I can't even begin to imagine how much time I have wasted because of this.  This could have been remedied by Asus getting rid of the right Fn key (does anyone even use this?!) and shifting the page up key over 1/2 inch, since there is another Fn key on the left of the keyboard.

The two-finger scrolling takes a lot of time to get used to and it only works about 80 or 90% of the time.  Also, it's really easy to accidentally resize the page.  I am sure this is a feature that could be kindof cool if you got the hang of it but I haven't gotten to that point so I find it pretty obnoxious.

The final kicker though, and what motivated me to write up this review, is that my battery life has gradually decreased to the point that it lasts only about 4-5 hours.  When I first got the computer I could get around 10-10.5 hours on the ""balanced"""" plan- not exactly as high as it was advertized at but I knew that to get such a long life out of the battery you had to do a bunch of configuring with the power settings and I had access to power most of the time so I was pretty satisfied.  I intend to use this computer on a year long trip in Latin America","['computer ok surf web', 'manner window', 'open time', 'pretty sluggish', 'sweet time', 'cpu usage leap', 'apparent reason', 'figure problem', 'work minute', 'computer act', 'old computer', 'base review', 'order gb ram chip', 'slow slow gb ram', 'asus shelf gb ram', 'fact problem stream video', 'able stream video', 'satisfactory manner ok', 'pause video', 'un pause', 'reload page negate', 'point web storage', 'computer day plug peak performance gb gb', 'connection speed stream', 'datum computer', 'reasonable rate', 'specific fast acceptable web storage', 'year point pay', 'hard drive', 'technical thing', 'frustrating touch', 'huge pain ass', 'thumb hover touch', 'attention type sentance middle paragraph', 'small giant inconvenience', 'page button time', 'select text type page result delete', 'entire page type', 'time waste remedie asus', 'rid right fn key use', 'page key inch fn key', 'keyboard finger', 'lot time work time', 'resize page', 'pretty obnoxious', 'final kicker motivate', 'review battery life', 'computer hour', 'high advertize', 'life battery bunch configure power setting access power time', 'computer year', 'long trip latin america']"
"Overall, this is an excellent choice if you need a lightweight portable laptop. It offers great battery life, a reasonably powerful processor, and ASUS reliability. System feels solid and has excellent build quality. The webcam works fine, and it's fast enough for my daily business and software development tasks. My only gripes thus far? The system comes with a good bit of junkware. It's partitioned with an 80gb system partition, and the rest for data. I wanted to start fresh so I had to find a Windows 7 x64 Pro install disk, repartition, and install the drivers/tools I needed. (The product activated fine with the product key sticker on the bottom of the system.)  It has HDMI, but no eSATA port.  Lastly, it's common to have the cursor jump while typing due to brushing the touchpad, but I fixed this problem after installing the touchpad driver and tweaking the settings.  Overall, I'd recommend this product to anyone needing a full featured lightweight laptop.","['excellent choice need lightweight', 'portable laptop', 'great battery life', 'powerful processor asu reliability system', 'quality webcam work', 'fine fast daily business software development task gripe', 'good bit junkware partition gb system partition rest datum', 'pro install disk repartition install driver tool need product activate', 'fine product key sticker system hdmi esata port', 'common cursor', 'type brush touchpad fix problem instal touchpad driver tweak setting overall', 'product need', 'lightweight laptop']"
"Purpose of the Computer
General purpose activities such as browsing, word processing, reading emails, college work, occasional game, or occasional software development.

Some Defects:
I have owned this laptop for a year and a quarter. (Laptop was manufactured in August of 2010) Overall the laptop has performed well, but there are some problems and some design defects. First, the keyboard is not the best of quality as after several months of use the v key broke which I had to fix using superglue. Also, the keyboard flexes constantly, but the flexing is not too much of a problem. The next problem is the screen. The screen is not reinforced enough against pressure, and the spacers are less then adequate, as the screen will touch the keyboard. Because of this design defect with the screen, my screen as sustained damage and now has two pressure marks left on the LCD in the center of the screen. Lastly, the hot key software provided by Asus is not the greatest and has locked up on me several times forcing me to manually restart the process. However, I have found the software to be stable if the hibernation or standby features of Windows 7 are not used.

Some issues:
The screen will flicker when connected to the ac after using the battery. This issue can be fixed by unplugging the laptop and then plugging the laptop back in. Additionally, there is no easy access to the fan duct making it impossible to clean dust out of the computer without voiding the warranty.

The Verdict
I am overall pleased with the laptop, but am only giving the product three stars as my former laptop, a Dell Inspiron E1405, had none of these problems. Additionally, the Inspiron had covers which allowed access to the fan duct for cleaning, a feature I consider important.","['purpose computer general purpose activity', 'word processing', 'email college work', 'occasional game', 'occasional software development defect', 'own laptop year quarter laptop manufacture', 'august overall laptop', 'problem design defect keyboard good quality month use key', 'fix superglue keyboard', 'problem problem screen screen reinforce pressure spacer', 'adequate screen touch keyboard design defect screen screen', 'damage pressure mark', 'lcd center screen', 'hot key software', 'great lock time force', 'restart process', 'stable hibernation standby', 'windows issue screen flicker', 'ac battery issue fix unplug laptop plug laptop', 'easy access fan duct', 'impossible clean dust computer void warranty verdict overall', 'product star laptop dell inspiron problem', 'access fan duct']"
"I've been using the laptop for nearly a month and have been very impressed with the balance of performance, battery life, size, and weight.  It runs all my applications without trouble.  I use it primarily as a website development machine.  I can have my entire XAMPP development environment loaded, including Eclipse, MySQL, Apache, and Photoshop without it slowing down at all.

The keyboard and trackpad are easy to use and the screen is great.  I don't have any trouble seeing the screen in bright light.  I can go for hours on the battery; I have yet to run out of power despite a couple weeks of constant traveling and usage, including time in the airport and up to 4 hours on the airplane.

The only two problems I've had are with the internal fan and the speakers.  When I updated my system drivers the fan was very noisy and wouldn't slow down at all - even though the laptop wasn't at all hot.  I had to go back to an earlier driver to fix it.  The speakers are also very quiet - which isn't that big of a deal to me as I generally use headphones anyway.

Overall a great product.","['balance performance battery life size weight run application trouble use', 'website development machine', 'entire xampp development environment load', 'eclipse mysql apache photoshop', 'slow keyboard trackpad', 'easy use screen', 'great trouble', 'bright light hour battery run power', 'couple week', 'time airport hour airplane problem', 'internal fan speaker update system driver fan noisy', 'slow laptop', 'driver fix speaker', 'headphone overall', 'great product']"
"At first, I was confused when I looked at product description. There is no different between G73JH-A1 and G73JH-A3. I made a decision to purchase G73JH-A3 anyway. I bought it via one business delivery, and it was delivered last night. I found that the spec of G73JH-A3 is different from G73JH-A1. G73JH-A3 has

1 8G 1333 MHz Memory, not 1033 MHz.
2. Yes, A3 has 4G SSD. You can select  statup applications by FastBoot utility  and it boosts up the Windows 7 startup speed a lot.

I am a programmer more than 30 years and I used more than 40 notebooks. Recently, I ordered Dell Studio 17 but Dell could not deliver it on time and  I cancelled the order and purchased this G73JH-A3. The ASUS quality is much better than Dell, I guess. My other notebook, Dell Studio XPS 1640 has many troubles for me and I fixed it several times.

This notebook is perfect to me, because I develop applications by Java, and I need memory and hard disk space. I am using Windows 7 and Ubuntu 10.04. G73JH-A3 works well at both OS.

When I setup G73JH-A3 today, it was crashed several times. Specially, when I played MS media player, it was always crashed. I set TDT at bios disabled and it is now O.K or upgrade bios to version 209.

I am very satisfied with this notebook. G73JH is not only a gaming machine. It supports my development a lot. Also, it looks like a normal notebook(At least, front look). I could use it at my office.

Good:
  1. Nice quality, good keyboards, sound and display
  2. Many Asus utilities to customerize configuration.
  3. Good price

Bad:
  1. Where is express card slot? G73JH does not have it. I could not use my sound blaster express card.
  2. Touchpad is useless. The buttons are too firm to press.
  3. Old fashioned battery (8cell) - 12 cell recommended. It could make half hour longer life without external power.
  4. I hope that G73JH will have audio control buttons on the top. Sometimes, I will use this notebook at office, and audio buttons are recommended.
  5. Lack description at manuals: Yes, I know what they are without explanation. I am a programmer. But, the manuals does not explain manythings(VT-d, TDT, UEFI boot or PXE ROM). Normal people don't know them and they could not find any information from ASUS web site.

"Initially, I am very happy with this machine. It is truly a great desktop replacement. That is said, I did have to return it twice, first time the DVD/Blu Ray drive was not working properly, PowerDVD used to freeze and I have to force shut it down, but Amazon sent a replacement within 6 hours and within two days I got the new machine. 2 days later I realized that I have one did pixel on the screen, for that I had to get an RMA and return it to ASUS to replace the screen. For about 4 months everything was perfectly working fine. I use this computer for gaming in addition to real work. I played COD modern warfare 2, GTA 4 and Assassin Greek and Resident Evil 5. You can get the same specs from Dell/Alienware for about $2700, while I bought my ASUS from Amazon for $1842. And I love the screen, it is an amazing HD and great quality picture.

After six months of owning the laptop a new problem has appeared. The video card (GPU) overheats when playing games for more than 30 minutes. After 30 minutes the laptop shuts down due to high temperature. I did some research and I realized that the laptop GPU idle temperature should be around 55C, while mine was in the range 75-80C. While gaming the temperature should be around 75-85C, while mine exceeds 100C all the time and it reaches the maximum allowed temperature 114C then the computer shuts down. I have to wait 5 minutes for the computer to cool down then turn it on again. The fans on the laptop are always on high speed, specially the one next the video card.

I have to RMA it again. One expects that such product to be thoroughly tested since it is a gaming laptop.

"I have only had this laptop for a few days, and I absolutely love it.  I have to disagree with the other review that says that the keyboard is small and flimsy.  As a full time student who spends a lot of time typing, the keyboard was one of the most important features to me when comparing laptops.  The keyboard on this Asus is very comfortable, comparable to the keyboard on the Mac Powerbooks.  And I love having the number pad!  I guess it all depends on what you're used to. I'd also like to comment that the laptop looks great.  From the photos it looked pretty plain, and I was worried about being dissapointed by it because I was looking for something stylish.  In the end I chose Asus' reputation as being reliable over the style of some other laptops I was considering.  When I recieved my Asus I realized that it was the best of both worlds--all the reliability and components I wanted, and really sharp looking too!  I'd recommend the Asus K50IJ to anyone based on my experiences so far.","['laptop day', 'disagree review', 'small flimsy time student', 'lot time', 'laptop keyboard asus', 'comfortable comparable keyboard mac powerbooks', 'comment laptop look', 'great photo look', 'dissapointe look stylish end', 'asus reputation', 'reliable style laptop', 'recieve asus', 'good world reliability component', 'sharp look', 'asus ij base experience']"
"Bought my Asus K50IJ in January 2010, so I've been with it for a while. Mine has the older T6600 (Core 2 Duo) processor, but according to some research it is almost identical to the T4500 in this model. I use my computer several hours per day, mostly on the Internet, and I have been very pleased overall. Here are some of the things I've observed:

Positive: excellent style and all around feel. Processor, hard drive and RAM are more than adequate for any good laptop - in fact, a 500 GB hard drive is extremely rare for this price. The computer is much cooler than other models, as Asus says. Battery life is good to excellent. Keyboard is OK overall; more about that later. The one year damage replacement warranty was a strong selling point with me. Haven't had any experience at all with Asus support; though I'm told its excellent. Facial recognition login works quite well most of the time, depending on light, and is a much easier way to log in. SD card reader is conveniently placed (front center) and simple to use to DL photos from my camera or cell.

Negative: first, using the keyboard with the touch pad is insanely aggravating. It is impossible to type rapidly without my palms bumping the touch pad now & then, and when that happens the cursor is repositioned and I begin typing somewhere else. (Yes, I have tried every imaginable setting for the touch pad.) This happened constantly and was VERY aggravating, so of course I began to use a wireless mouse 99% of the time - thankfully I can set it to ignore touch pad input when it is plugged in. But every now & then I like to use the computer without the external mouse. According to the settings I chose, it should automatically begin responding to input from the touch pad when I unplug the mouse - but no such luck. The last few times I've unplugged the mouse, it refused to respond to touch pad input, so I had no control at all until I plugged in the mouse again. Also, several times I have plugged in the mouse after using the touch pad, and the touch pad refused to stop responding. In each of these cases I had to do several reboots to clear up the problem. Consequently I no longer attempt to use the computer without the external mouse - too much hassle. I feel this is a major issue, and prevents me from awarding this computer the five stars it would otherwise earn.

Another issue that is the computer must be handled very gently. I bumped it a couple of times when it was new, and heard a weird mechanical clicking inside, and the screen froze. I had to do a hard reboot. Obviously I handle it like an egg now, but it seems a laptop should be able to handle a few minor bumps without any issues. That is certainly true with the last one, which is now 6 or 7 years old.

As to layout design - the keyboard is not all that user friendly, as the advertisement implies. Response is less than stellar - often while typing rapidly I will hit a key and not get any response - so I have to back up and re-type. If you do a lot of typing, this could be an issue for you. In addition, the arrow keys are oddly placed - wedged between the number keys and alpha keys. This computer replaced an older IBM x-31, which, although admittedly IBM's top of the line premium business model, had a wonderfully responsive keyboard compared to this one. I could easily ""blind type"""" on the IBM with few errors. The lack of dedicated volume keys is a problem as well.

Pros: Fast and responsive, have yet to receive any problems so far.

Cons: Nothing major/serious.

I also use a 64GB flash drive (USB 3.0) for all my work files (sync to other machines) and am able to use all MS Office apps and even able to view some Autocad files.

IMHO this machine blows away my smartphone (Droid 2 Global). It has Win 7 pro (remote desktop), solid wi-fi and wired connections, USB 3.0, good camera and speakers for Skype, and will easily last 9 hours with moderate use. Meets my needs.

Still, I wish it was dual core with HD display and video driver and onboard G3-G4. But, I want all this without loss of battery life. Am I asking too much?","['month travel europe', 'couple lenovo', 'battery life', 'huge comparison', 'small gb ssd room movie battery life', 'hard datum', 'spinner use gb flash drive usb work file sync machine', 'able use ms office app', 'able view autocad file imho machine blow', 'smartphone droid', 'pro remote desktop', 'solid wi fi', 'connection usb good camera speaker skype', 'moderate use meet need', 'dual core hd display video driver onboard', 'loss battery life']"
"I am so pleased with my netbook. I did a lot of research before I decided to buy this one. I manage a Cafeteria & wanted something that would be smaller & lighter in weight to use than my currant laptop. This one is perfect for me. It has enough ram & storage for all my work. Of course the screen is smaller than your normal laptop, but I love the fact the battery last so much longer then my currant (Toshiba) laptop. Never have a problem with finishing what I need to do on it before I need to recharge the battery. This is what mattered the most to me. Info stated 13 hrs. of battery; I typically get 10-12 hrs. with no problems. My Asus EE comes with 2GB Ram, 320 Hard drive, plus Windows 7 Professional. Don't fool with buying a netbook & upgrading the ram and adding Windows 7. This guy comes with everything ready to go on it. The outside case is great too, you don't have to worry about fingerprints. Everything about this netbook is great, I can highly recommend it!","['netbook lot research', 'manage cafeteria', 'small light weight use currant laptop', 'perfect ram storage work course screen', 'small normal laptop', 'fact battery', 'long currant toshiba laptop problem finish need need recharge battery matter info state hrs battery', 'hrs problem asus ee', 'gb ram', 'hard drive', 'professional fool', 'netbook upgrade ram', 'windows guy', 'fingerprint netbook']"
"This is a very good laptop at this price. The laptop is loaded with a lot of features some of them are only found in high-end machines. I would particularly like to point out the i5 processor and the solid-state hard drive. Add that to the 8GB RAM and it makes this a lightning-fast machine for any work. It has a high-resolution screen and a pretty decent battery life. The laptop comes with Windows 10 Pro pre-installed. It is very light in weight and you don’t even feel the weight in the backpack.

It also has a touchscreen and fingerprint scanner. Although for me they are not of much use and seem like a marketing gimmick. But some people may like to have these features.

The only regret I have is that the 8GB DDR4 Ram is soldered to the board and hence there is no possibility of upgrading the Ram even if you want to.

Other than this, it is a great laptop and comes at a low price. I would surely recommend it.",
"There's a lot to like in this little package.  Here are some quick thoughts and observations from the last month.

Pros:

1) Easy set-up.  One thing you'll immediately note is how easy the Acer TravelMate is to set up.  My teenage daughter intercepted this before I got home and was happily checking her school email within 30 minutes with no assistance from me.
2) Responsive components.  The full-size keyboard is nicely responsive and feels very natural when typing.  The mouse pad is the same and a huge step up from our Chromebook.  The backlit keyboard not only looks cool, it is very handy when typing in low/no light.
3) The processor is decidedly adequate for non-gaming-specific uses.  While not lightning fast, it's by no means sluggish when navigating web applications (including games), word processors, etc...  We can have multiple applications and windows open without noticeable lag.
4) The hard drive IS lightning fast, saving and loading remarkably quickly.
5) The webcam is sharp and has been very useful lately with all the Zoom meetings.  (I verified this by hosting a meeting on another computer.  Again, the audio and video are a giant step up from our Chromebook.)
6) It's very light.

Cons:

1) The screen is a bit on the dull side.  The colors are not particularly vibrant.  If you're hoping to use this for movies/gaming, it's adequate but you'll might be underwhelmed.
2) Norton comes pre-installed.  If you've had that on any PC, you know how much of a pop-up headache (and how darn-near impossible to uninstall) it is.  (Ugh!)
3) Glitchy Google Chrome.  Can't explain why but we cannot use this computer's Chrome browser.  It is constantly asking for parental permission for use, which we've repeatedly granted through my Google account.  It was so frustrating we did a factory reset and reinstalled Chrome with a different account attached.  Same result.  Now we have to use Explorer.  (Shiver!)
4) The touch screen isn't great.  Feels like an unnecessary expense, too, since we navigate almost exclusively without it.
5) It's very light. Listed as both a pro and a con.  The pro side should be obvious.  On the con side, it has me thinking this unit needs to be cared for with kid gloves.  It doesn't reek of sturdiness.  I'm not saying its wimpy (I'll post an update if something remarkable happens one way or another) but it kind of feels that way.

Overall, I'm very pleased with this unit.  Everything feels decidedly ""adequate"".  There are better ""value"" options out there for those who don't want to spend this much, but if you're looking for a satisfying and functional laptop for work or school, this is a solid choice.",
"My laptop does light video and audio editing, lots of desktop publishing, and web browsing, often at the same time, which has been a problem with some laptops I've had.  This one handles it well with no lags or hiccups (two MS Office apps, 8 browser tabs, Premiere Elements all at once).  The screen is sharp with warm colors that pop.  The 3 USB ports (2 3.1 and 1 USB-C) handle a backup drive and USB hub with no issue.  I really love that this has a full size HDMI port on it so I don't have to waste the USB-C port on a video cable.  The keyboard is also identical (1/2"" less wide) to a full-sized external keyboard, so typing is easy and feels good.  However, because it is smaller laptop, there is no extra number pad and the Insert/Delete/Home/End/PageUp/PageDown keys do double duty with some others.  However, the Fn key does turn some of the keys into a number pad (Fn+F12 [NumLk]) so you can get a true number pad on this.  The keyboard is also backlit with a white light so typing in dark places is no problem.  Acer did maximize space and you can see that this is significantly smaller than a 15.6"" laptop (first pic) in size and is just under 3/4"" in height at its thickest.  It is made of a material that feels like a hard plastic but is super lightweight (just over 2 lbs.).  The WiFi has great reception and is speedy.

Two notes.  The back is attached with about 11 hex screws (0.8).  I tried to see if its was upgradeable but the back also seems to be glued on as well and didn't pop off after the screws were undone.  I always run an external drive anyway so not a problem, but this may be a consideration for some.  There is no memory card slot either, which seems to be more and more common now with cloud storage, but my hub solves that issue for me as well.  I'm still getting used to this but so far have no complaints.",
"Acer's TravelMate X514-51 has been an awesome piece of equipment – especially during this time of working from home. Powerful, fast, and extremely light – weighing in at 2.16 pounds. It’s almost like carrying a manila folder. This is mainly due to its magnesium alloy composition, giving it the look and feel of a plastic hard shell case. It’s so light that you might even forget you have it in your carry-on – so be careful!

Like most laptops, it opens to 180 degrees and had touchscreen capability. The lid comes with a slightly raised Acer logo. You get a 14-inch 1080p display (Full HD) with good touchscreen responsiveness. You also get a screen cleaning cloth to keep things clean. The webcam is located at the top of the screen. You’ll have to provide your own privacy cover. Speakers are on the bottom on the unit. I don’t use it for gameplay, so there’s no real benefit to great speakers for business purposes. If anything, the headphone jack provides the necessary means for sound should it be needed.

The keyboard is full-size and sits above the trackpad. The trackpad is one piece (no separate buttons for left/right clicks), but it does offer the left/right click capability in the pad. You just have to make sure your fingers are hitting on the right spot. To the right of the trackpad is a fingerprint sensor for security. During setup, you’ll be walked through the steps to establish this option by recording your fingerprint, similar to that used on the iPhone.

Inside is the Intel Core i7-8565U. This does just fine for me speed-wise. You can get into clock speeds and comparing GHz differences, but I had no delays with several apps open, along with PowerPoint, Excel, Word, and the Firefox browser open. The most common RAM in laptops is 8GB. Here you get 16GB RAM, which makes for great performance when multi-tasking. The TravelMate also comes with 512GB SSD.  I’ve learned to use an external hard drive, but this is a decent amount of storage nowadays and I use it as my back up. The battery life clocked in around 6 hours and took about 45-60m to recharge.

As far as ports go,  you get two USB type A ports, an HDMI port, a standard 3.5 mm headphone jack, a USB type C port (I use this for an external hard drive), and a Kensington lock. I’ve never used a Kensington lock, but if you’re using your computer in a public place and want to prevent someone from swiping it if you step away, it’s something to consider.

Overall – 4 ½ stars overall. Great performance, a super light but secure design, and a system that doesn’t run hot. Very impressive!",
"Overall, this is a solid laptop for the price. Acer has never been my favorite brand but they do seem to offer some of the best value laptops if you cant afford something more high end. The laptop is unbelievably light. I’m used the my Lenovo Thinkpad (work station) and I feel like I still use way too much effort to pick it up, sort of flnging it up and back down again unintentionally. One concern I have is that it sounded like there is something loose in the laptop since the day I got it and I’ve yet to open up the body and find out what it is. When I picked it up, I could hear something moving around in it and I think it finally got stuck somewhere because I’m not hearing it anymore. I don’t love the keyboard, it definitely takes some getting use to how flat it is and the spacing feels a little uncomfortable. If you’re not switching between numerous laptops and keyboards, you’ll probably get used to it and rarely notice it again. For me, it feels a little unnatural and the depth of the keys feels strange. I’m sure some of this is a product of being such a thin laptop. The great thing about though is that I can fit it in any of my backpacks, even my smaller ones without issue. It’s more compact and lightweight than my Mead notebook. It’s also faster than my other computers (my more powerful work stations) but that may just be a product of being brand new. The display is nice, a little more vivid and crisp than my slightly older laptops. It was also packaged pretty well. The packing wasn’t anything too crazy, not foam or buffer padding in the box which initially scared me but it was very secure in the laptop product box. It’s hard to say exactly how well it will hold up over time but so far it seems to be a pretty good value for what you get factoring in the size. I’d recommend looking at one in person first before deciding (or check the return policy) It’s a good laptop but I feel a little awkward typing on it so I only ever use it when I’m on the go/ working outside of the house or office. I'll update again in the future as I continue to use it.

The fingerprint sis bait doesn’t work. Maybe that’s what the rattling sound was when I received it. Either way, it’s annoying that new product has features that are either physically damaged in the body of the laptop or just straight up don’t work.",
"I wish I were a little more computer savvy, so that I could give you all the statistics and specifics about this Acer TravelMate x5 Thin & Light Business Laptop, that most people want to hear. Just know that I've been using a computer, almost daily, for more than twenty-five years. I know what I like, and what works for me. I needed a computer that could be used for our new family business. Mostly used at home, but could be packed up and used on site. This Acer TravelMate seems to be exactly what I needed. It's very light, weighing in at just a little over two pounds. At fourteen inches, it could easily fit into most of the purses that I carry. ( Okay, who am I kidding? Any chance to buy a new bag - I'm all IN!) With up to ten hours of battery life, it's very portable. I can go all day without having to worry about plugging it in, and tangling with cords. The initial start up, was so easy! Cortana, your virtual assistant, created by Microsoft for Windows 10, walked me through the process, every step of the way. This Acer TravelMate has Windows 10 Professional, which was created for advanced users and small businesses, who may appreciate the advanced features, such as encryption, Remote Desktop, assigned access and more. Further bolstering your security, this computer has the Acer Bio-Protection Fingerprint Solution. All very useful features for many, who have concerns about the security of their computers, and it's contents.
 I mentioned that it's small, at only fourteen inches. I have to tell you, I've owned a couple of tablet computers, and I found that with them, that smaller space ALWAYS meant a sacrifice of typing area, and function keys. I don't find that to be true with the Acer TravelMate. I'm more inclined to use the computer's calculator for math, and I don't miss the additional numerical keypad, at all. I LOVE the backlighting! It automatically dims down, when you're not actively using it, and with my fading eyesight, it helps me to FIND all the function keys. The HD screen is gorgeous, so crisp and clear. Frankly, it was the first thing that I noticed about this computer. It's stunning! The more I use this Acer TravelMate, the more I love it. I haven't had a whole lot of time for recreational moments, on this computer yet, but the few shows I've put on, and videos that I've watched, play well, and look and sound great.  I feel like I'm not sacrificing anything, and loving all the ""new to me,"" features. Because it's billed as a laptop, I'd be remiss if I failed to point out a feature, that some might find problematic. If you use it AS a laptop, ON your lap, with sound, the speakers are on the bottom of the computer. This seriously muffles the sound. It sounds best on a solid, hard surface. This Acer TravelMate meets all my expectations, and I've become reliant on features that I didn't know I needed. Every day I'm discovering new features that delight me, and I'm finding, invaluable.",
"I ordered through Amazon and received it 2 days later. So far, I’m pleased. It synchronized with all of my google stuff. My docs & photos that are on my phone are also on the HP 360 Chrome which is very cool. I did have to power off then back on because my sound cut out . I it was an app notification that started the issue but honestly can’t say. After I restarted the 360 it’s been fine ever since. I basically will be using it to surf the web, produce & save documents, send emails every now and then and stream movies. Having the USB type C ports are like icing on the cake. Already ordered a 10’ type c to HDMI cord to stream movies to the tv in my RV. The touchscreen is great!! I unplugged it from the power for the day to see how long it will last. It’s been over 12 hours and the battery is no where near depleted. I haven’t been on it the whole time but a good amount of the day. Hope this review helps someone.",
"The Vivobook 15 is often compared and contrasted with the Acer Aspire 5. In my opinion the Vivobook is a far better choice!

The Aspire looks nice and performs decently, and the screen is great for the price. But inside, it feels really cheap, with the battery not actually even being fastened in place at all. And the RAM expansion slot in the one I got didn't work and Acer tech support was entirely unhelpful. I returned it.

By happy contrast, the Vivobook feels quite sturdy, almost like aluminum even where it's plastic, and the inside seems... not premium, but well built. And RAM installation (and SSD replacement) went smoothly. Great BIOS, too, the best I've seen.

Mine *did* come with a 2.5 inch hard drive expansion caddy and connector in the box, which is a nice touch.
I'm running Linux (openSUSE Tumbleweed) on it and it runs flawlessly. Just boot to BIOS and turn off Secure Boot and Fast Startup, then reboot to a USB flash drive with the installer for the distro of your choice.

I do think the Aspire has a somewhat better screen. But the Vivobook screen is still fine for the price; not the most colorful, but brightness is adequate and text and images are sharp and clear.

Very happy with my purchase!",
"Didn't realize I was being sent the store display tablet. When I received it, it was in store display mode and I had to do a ton of online searching to figure out how to get it out of that mode. Then after only using it for maybe a month or 2 the tablet has stopped being able to remain on while off of the charger. So, after while of only working on the charger, the tablet just stopped staying on for more than a minute even with being on the charger. The battery is clearly the problem since it was the display product which remains on the charger the entire day at the store, which damages the battery. The worst part about it was that there was no notice this was the store display product and no instructions or help to resolve any issues I might run into. If you're planning on buying this, make sure you check it isn't the store display product. Can't emphasize it enough. Other than this HUGE problem, the tablet is awesome and I would've given it a 5.",
"Giving this a one star based off performance alone.

I was originally extremely excited to receive the brand new Samsung tablet. I mostly use tablets for media consumption and web browsing. I read tons of reviews between various tablets and this one seemed to be the clear leader in the android space for a larger screen tablet which I really wanted over the ipad 2.

The user experience for this tablet is very sub par imo. I went back and forth on whether I should keep it and try and load a custom ROM but in the end I decided it would not be worth it, the tablet should work out of the box from a performance perspective.

Browsing is incredibly slow in side by side comparisons with my very old nexus tablet. I used several different browsers and all of them seemed like I was on a dial up connection with content rich websites. Dolphin browser seemed to be the best but I enjoy using Chrome and I shouldn't have to change my browser because of a hardware/software in a tablet. The screen looks good but at the same time the display driver doesn't seem to perform very well, scrolling and movement are often very jittery and don't appear to give a great experience. Some games performed well while others seemed almost blurry with movements.

I'm not a huge apple fan but I may have to go with an ipad 2, the nvidia shield looks to be my only other viable alternative. I'm really disappointed that this tablet didn't work out.

I would not recommend this product unless you've never used another tablet before and maybe don't know what you are missing.",
"I have an Android phone but this is my first experience with a Android tablet/computer. I'm used to Microsoft and i use MS Word and Excel a lot. I  wanted a downsized laptop so I thought this wpuld be a great solution: wrong, wrong wrong. I tried to make it work but after three months I'm finally giving up. There isn't much wrong with the tablet itself, but the Android operating system is a royal pain if you try to do anything serious with it.

First of all, most of the ""apps"" (similar to the Android phone apps) that you download are dumb downed and are missing a lot of important features. First example is banking. Basic stuff with Wells Fargo worked OK but when I wanted to download an old statement it would not work no matter how long I talked to the bankers. Second example is using it with my Fidelity brokerage account. I could not use it to make a money transfer - not happening with all of their technical support. Their suggestion; use a REAL computer. Their built-in Hanscon ""Word"" and ""Excel"" applications work OK by themselves but because of the MS copyrights saving and recalling files is a pain because they make you jump through more file manipulation steps to get to you folders. Another major pain is basic editing features. It is almost impossible in some applications to do simple ""Copy"" and ""Paste"" types of functionality. I know that apart of the issue is that application developers are to blame - it doesn't matter who's at fault if you  can't do what you want.

The positives are that it has a great display and some of the ""phone like"" user interface features are nice. The battery life is OK and the touch display works great. The price is great too. It just isn't ready for use as a serious laptop capable computer - it falls way short. I'm taking a loss on this purchase and now I'm going to try a Lenovo Yoga 2 in 1 running Windows 10.",
"I researched for ages and it is so hard comparing negative and positive reviews! It is exhausting work, too.  I had an iPad 2 from work and wanted a tablet of my own for home.  I have the Samsung Galaxy 5 phone and felt so-so about it. It's battery does not last and it has more features than I need.  But the background knowledge helped me set up this tablet very easily!

The screen is gorgeous, email, Web surfing, games, easy, sound is WAY better than iPad and the battery lasts forever.  I love that it has a micro SD slot so I can transfer stuff to my laptop or desktop.  Pdf files are way easier on here than on the iPad too.

Super happy I bought this tablet. I just need to find a good case now.

Also, download Amazon play store to get your Kindle app and stream music from the Prime Music app if you have a membership. I played music for 4 hours today and it only went down to 80% battery power. That was impressive to me!",
"I upgraded from an old Acer Iconia Tab A500. I'm really not seeing a big difference in performance except for the screen resolution. I find the Galaxy Tab S is a little more responsive but nothing significant. The Galaxy Tab S has one BIG DOWNSIDE. Samsung has loaded it so full of bloatware that it actually made me angry with the countless updates and pestering me to sign up for this or that. Google is in your face constantly with their apps too. At one point a popup advised me that it was updating 239 apps (I have installed only 37 of my own).  At times I really want to put a bullet hole in it and ship it back to Samsung...  but watching videos is much better then on my old Acer.

BEFORE YOU BUY BE AWARE THAT SAMSUNG HAS PREINSTALLED TONS OF JUNK APPLICATIONS THAT WILL ANNOY THE SH*T OUT OF YOU. You can't uninstall most of them. You'll have to go through each and every one of them, determine if they are required for the operating system by google-ing etc.  Then you have to disable them if possible - not all can be disabled. After that you have to hide each one from the menus to get rid of all the clutter.

Too bad.... this is a really nice tablet otherwise. As it is Samsung has decided to sell you a product full of advertisements and tricks to get you to sign up for this or that.

Maybe I will shoot it...  I'll keep you posted.

2/21/17 I shot it with a 4/10 shotgun and yes, I enjoyed doing it. The tablet began to fail a few months ago. The battery would sometimes charge and other times not. For example, I would leave it plugged but when I went to use it the battery was low. I was also experiencing frequent lockups when the battery got low. Yes I checked cables etc. (internal and external). I fully regret this purchase and would not recommend this brand tablet to anyone. Google the issue regarding battery problems and you'll find a lot of unhappy owners. This item is too expensive to take the risk.",
"Wow wow wow, I just received my tablet and it is BEAUTIFUL.  I also own iPad and the Samsung's screen resolution is so much better than iPad.  I purchased this basically to play Megapolis which I play on all platforms and seeing the screens side by side lets me know that I made a great purchase.  I own Samsung TVs and their pictures are beautiful too, so I can say that they have done it again in this Tablet.  I know that I will get very little sleep tonight because I'll be exploring this wonderful Tablet.  Looks like Apple has some real competition with this one.  I do love my iPad but I can already tell I'm going to love this Tablet too and I'm not certain I want to spend any longer what Apple wants with its hardware, of course time will tell.

If you are looking for a new Tablet search no further and go for this one.  I was looking for the larger screen size because of being a game player but I have been reading that Samsung should be coming out with a new smaller screen size sometime this year, so if smaller is what you want just keep waiting.

Love it, love it.",
"This is a recent upgrade to my Galaxy Tab 2 10 inch and I'm VERY pleased with this new device. It is everything I was hoping it would be, and then some. Nice weight, stunning graphic, fast processor, stable and solid in every respect. There really isn't much to add to the other reviews because it just IS the best Android tablet available. That said, I wish they had stayed with the soft-touch buttons that stay on the bottom left of the screen however you choose to orient the tablet. The three hard buttons fixed to the bottom of the device REALLY get in the way when you hold it vertically when reading a book or playing a game that only plays when the device is vertical. I'm sure there was a reason for doing this, but I LOVE the moving soft-touch buttons of my Tab 2 and do NOT like these stationary hard-touch buttons at all. Since everything else about this tablet is wonderful, I'm only taking off 1 star for the dislike of the buttons, but I would love this tablet completely if not for this one, stand out poor decision by the people who designed the Tab S.",
"With the Samsung Galaxy Tab S 10.5, Samsung finally got their Android tablet right. Having used the previous variations of the Galaxy Tab back to the first 7 inch version, this is by far the best Android tablet out there. The tablet is light, though not quite on par with the Sony Xperia Z2 Tablet, and it is thin. The screen is gorgeous and the battery life is much improved.

I am not completely sold on a fingerprint sensor for a tablet, though. Maybe for business use, but for personal use, not quite.

Pros

Lightweight & thin
Gorgeous display
Fast, even with TouchWiz
Great battery life, roughly 9-11 hours with 8-9 hours of screen time using low brightness
Smaller bezels - finally
Dual speakers!!!

Cons

TouchWiz still isn't the best UI. I installed Nova Launcher for a better experience.
Bloatware - But this isn't a Nexus device so it was to be expected
Smaller bezels - where can I put my hands without interrupting the scrolling experience?
Physical buttons - come on, Samsung, it's 2014. On screen buttons should be the standard.
Speaker location - could be on the front. Hey, at least we got two!

Conclusion: Overall, the tablet is a vast improvement over previous Samsung offerings and near the top of the list for Must-Have Android tablets.",
"My daughter got one of these for Christmas, and I was blown away by the screen quality and snappy response. I purchased the white 16 GB model, and have been VERY pleased. Video playback is a beautiful thing, as are the games I've tried on it. I've thrown some very video intense games at it, and it hasn't lagged or stuttered once. I happen to like the S5 look, and am pleased that the tablet works so well with my phone.The tablet came with Samsung coupons for 50% off any accessory, so I purchased the bluetooth keyboard case. I'm not overly crazy about the case design - the tablet and case remain separate pieces; when closed, the tablet fits into a slot and is held in place by a spring-loaded clip. When open, the tablet rests at an angle into another slot. It is, however, an EXCELLENT keyboard and is an incredibly useful extension, making the tablet come very close to a mini-laptop.

There are some issues with some of these tablets. My daughter's tablet is unable to stream video from Netflix OR the Google Play store. She can download video that she'd rented or purchased to her SD card and play it, but steaming will not work. We found many folks who'd purchased this tablet had the same problem, as there were hundreds of comments regarding the Netflix issue. We called Netflix, and they responded that it's a hardware problem with Samsung. Same response with Google. To date, no response from Samsung. Best advice if you purchase this tablet and run into issue where you can't stream - contact Amazon immediately for an exchange or refund. I sincerely hope you don't encounter it though, because in every other respect this is an awesome device.",
"This is the second time I've replaced this tablet. I carelessly (& accidentally) dropped the first one, face down with it being in its Samsung cover, and the darn thing had a large crack across the entire screen; though it still functioned properly. For awhile, I had been using it in its cracked state, but after awhile, I couldn't take it anymore. So, I ended up purchasing this same tablet all over again. I am a previous iPad 3 owner and will never go back to Apple again. The Galaxy Tab S 10.5 is still by-far, the best tablet on the market, in my opinion. It's even better than the Tab S2. I absolutely LOVE the high resolution screen on here, being able to watch Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, control my Roku, use Microsoft Excel, Word, PowerPoint, and love that I have the option to insert a micro SD card if I want more space. The only (& first) drawback I had after only a week, was experiencing the tablet not turning on or charging. Since this had never happened before, I decided to Google the issue. Turns out, while it is a rare occurrence, you need to do the following 3 in order: Press and hold down the Power -- Volume Up--Home keys at same time for 20 seconds, after which the green Android mascot should appear. When it does, it will give you two options to choose from. Choose the option that let's you cancel out of it (Press the Volume down). Next, the screen will say it's  downloading & not to turn device off. Wait about a few seconds, then repeat the holding of Power--Volume Up--Home keys at same time for about 10-15 seconds and everything should be back to normal. Make sure you charge it immediately. Aside from that extremely  minor and rare mishap, this tablet is a must!!!",
"Well I got it this afternoon. Funny cause the mailman was just putting my mail in the box when we drove up from Miami. So I've been messing around with it all afternoon. So far I like it. The display is insane and the keys are huge. Those were my biggest concerns and they are solved. It is noticeably faster. Even Web pages seem quicker. I'm still confused about a couple of things? Mostly settings. It says you can adjust the screen to a couple different settings but I try it just stays at the setting it wants to stay at? And a touch setting that says it's for wearing leather gloves to tap the screen etc. I was hoping for a setting that would make the tapping harder! You just look at this thing and it types or whatever. Less sensitive would be good.
I'm not sure I would rate it better than the iPad just yet? It is quite a bit easier to navigate. Could be I just don't understand apple's icons very good? The screen alone is much nicer than ipad. And I can see where having two browsers open side by side will be usefull. Or maybe a map and a browser., IPad can't touch that! Much lighter than Eileen's ipad. But her's isn't the iPad air? So I'll just have to take their word on that. I thought I read that this had a mini USB port? Haven't investigated that yet but unless the charging port doubles as mini USB I can't find it?
So, all in all I would advise that someone looking at ipad take a side by side look at the Tab S. I have a feeling that if I took this into an Apple store they would ask me to leave! Hmmmmm. Sounds like fun?
Oh, I've been using the fingerprint scanner to unlock this. Seems to work fine.

So, that is my official first day reveiw. Feel free to sell it to your friends, co-workers and family! Lol",
"I've had a Nexus 7 (2013) as my tablet.  I was looking into a 10"" tablet, primarily to play games and surf the web.  I wanted a tablet with a great display and high end processing power.  After researching numerous Android tablets (Apple's high price and lack of expandable memory eliminates iPad's from my consideration), I settled on the Galaxy Tab S.  I am extremely happy with my purchase for a number of reasons.

1.  Display - You can't appreciate how vivid and vibrant this display is without seeing it in person.  In a word, it is gorgeous to the point where you want to use the tablet more and more.  From movies on Netflix to magazines on Google Newsstand, the display just continues to impress me.  I've played with an iPad Air, Air 2, and mini and none have a display as good as the Galaxy Tab S.

2.  Size - This is an extremely thin and light tablet.  Compared to the Air 2, I can't really tell a difference in size or weight.  The Galaxy Tab S does have a slightly bigger display, but not by much.  The aspect ratios differ as well; I believe the iPad has a 4:3 and the Galaxy Tab S is 16:10.

3.  Micro SD - This is a great feature that sets the Galaxy Tab S from an iPad.  I was easily able to play my music and some videos on a micro SD card.  The tablet detected it without any issues and I didn't have to spend time side loading them onto the tablet like you would have to do on iTunes.  Knowing that I can simply swap out a micro SD card with additional media will make this a great tablet to have when traveling.

Overall this is an excellent tablet.  I got my for $447 on Amazon, which is even less expensive than a $499 iPad Air 2 16gb model.  If you are looking for a top end tablet, the Galaxy Tab S is the way to go.",
"Bought mine as a FACTORY refurb 2 1/2 years ago and it has performed flawlessly since day one! I emphasize factory, because as far as I'm concerned you're taking your chances buying one refurbished by anyone else. I use it every day, for everything from running my small business to just about every type of gaming. I can count on one hand the number of times it has locked up or power cycled, and it's always been due to bad apps I've installed and not the tablet itself. Battery life is still great...with steady use it'll last all day and if i unplug it in the morning and don't happen to use it until evening, it'll usually still be over 90% charged. Anyone with experience knows that its the screens on our devices that use up the most power while we use them, and this big beasty is no exception, so keep it set to auto adjust the brightness and it saves a lot of juice!
  The one and only flaw it has is due to the boneheaded decision Samsung made when they decided to build their flagship tablet with only 16gb of storage! That combined with the ridiculous amount of bloatware Samsung cant stop themselves from burdening their every device with, means that you will have to keep a close eye on storage space.
  Samsung was nice enough to toss out an update to Android 6.0.1 some time back, which improved things a bit by allowing the disabling of unwanted factory apps, which in turn did free up some space. However, the ONE feature that all of us in the Tab S 10.5 fanclub were REALLY looking forward to with Marshmallow, that of being able to format external memory cards as INTERNAL memory, Samsung chose NOT to implement! I know, right! There IS, however, a workaround that can be found on the XDA Developers website, for those savvy enough to try it.
  So, my recommendation is, by this tablet! It's not perfect, but none are. It's got one of the best screens available, even by todays standards, plenty of power, excellent build quality, and if you can keep the app installs under control (or try the workaround I mentioned), you will have in your hands one of the best!",
"This tablet is expensive but worth it if you want the best screen you can get. The colors are vivid and the picture is very sharp. The device connects to my new samsung 46"" tv and when viewing video on both simultaneously you can really see the difference. I was doing this while viewing parts of the last Craig Ferguson show and wow- his set looked much more colorful and sharp compared  to the TV's screen. More contrast on the S too.  Also on Christmas eve I shot some aerial go pro video of my cousin's farm. Christmas morning I showed them the video on the Tab S and several commented on how great the picture was. And, I did not tell them it was a new tablet before hand. So if you are buying a tablet for videos and pictures,then the screen is well worth it.  The device also has better connectivity than other tablets too. It has software that connects to your desktop/laptop so you can exchange any kind of files between your pc/tablet/cloud service. The tab S sees other devices in my house for connectivity and this was important to me as I don't like tablets/phones that try to limit your access to the outside world.

  If you can, try to look at the product in a store before you buy so you can see for yourself.  I did not do this and bought the Tab S 8.4 at first but after seeing the 10.5 in the store I had Amazon exchange it. The 10.5 size screen is much better for me but look at both and decide for yourself.

 Also I recommend you get some kind of case right away to protect the Tab S. Here is an inexpensive one that works well and while you may want something fancier later, this will get you going:

http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00L7GVIBQ/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

Now if you want to travel with you Tab S, here is a really nice Amazon traveling bag that fits the S well. This bag is of better quality than I expected for the price and I highly recommend it:

http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DUGZFA6/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

To balance this review,  I will have to say that Samsung also makes really nice mid line tablets as well. My GF got the Tab 4 8.0 and this is a great tablet at a much cheaper price. If money is an issue, look at these tablets. The screen is not as good, but it is still VERY good (better than the professional reviews will have you believe) and worth a look if you can't spend the money on the S.

I just read on the news this morning that Sony is coming out with a slightly larger tablet than the S, but without the nice screen. The price is going to be around $1000. Ouch! Good luck Sony competing at that price , esp with a basic LCD screen. Now I don't feel so bad about the S's price after reading that :)",
"I love this tablet. It's a 5 star tablet.
- The screen is amazing. Crystal clear and probably the best out there for tablets.
- Speed. This tablet is fast and I've only had mild lag issues.
- Android. The interface is wonderful, smooth, and intuitive.

But it has one fatal flaw. Bloatware.

I am paying for a 16gb tablet, yet I can only use a fraction of this amount because of the many unnecessary apps that are pre-installed and impossible to remove. Why?

If apps come pre-installed, allow us to remove them. I don't use Evernote, yet it is pre-installed and impossible to remove. Why? What function does this serve?

Doing the math, buyers really get about a 8gb tablet. 4-5gb goes to system memory and another 2-3gb are apps you can't get rid of.

I could add a SD card, but that also has drawbacks. In my experience, SD cards are unreliable. I've lost data numerous times due to SD card failure. This is the path I took and if I find a reliable card, I will update my review here.

It is really a shame that such wonderful hardware (and some software) gets dragged down by bloatware.",
"This tablet just blows me away!  I love the super-bright display and all the ways I am going to be able to use it!  It connects to my desktop so I don't need to store all my files on the tablet!  I can see my ""scrapbooked"" recipe cards while I cook, or read the sewing instructions I've downloaded while I sit at my sewing machine.  I have music on a tiny micro SD card, photos of my family, and I can read lots of Kindle e-books that I've downloaded to it.  It's  my computer, only portable!  I can wander all over our neighborhood with it and still surf or send email via Wi-Fi.  (Tip:  I did buy a new and very powerful combo modem/router to give me extended range - a Motorola Surfboard Extreme).  The full screen-width keyboard is easy to use for any size hands.  It is extremely fast when loading anything.  The battery lasts all day, and the camera is as good as my Canon SD, so it takes great pictures! The beautiful white case looks like expensive art glass.  It will soon be my ONLY computer because I'm having reconstructive surgery on my dominant hand, but I'll be able to do everything online that I need to with this delicious device, using only my non-dominant hand.  It will keep me happy during an otherwise very frustrating several months of recovery, and then again when I have my other hand surgery.  You can even choose to set it up for right or left handed use!  It does so much more than I expected, so I am just delighted with my purchase.  Be sure to get a nice case/stand to put yours in, because these are a bit slippery.  I will not only have a leather case/stand, but I'm making a beautiful tapestry mini brief case with handles to carry it in, because for me, handles will be absolutely necessary, but not everyone will need them.  If you have other things to carry, I recommend a case with handles, though.",
"One of the most disappointing devices i have ever owned.
CONS:
! enormous amount of bloatware that is UNREMOVABLE!!  No device is worth this aggravation
2 too complicated of an interface with for example 4 different categories of settings  and some of the placement and terms make no sense.  It took so long to figure out and i still dont get it  ex.Whatz ""dreamware"" setting mean?
3If there is an sd card port i cant find it-- or exactly which data device to buy from amazon,
4 Theres so many settings for power savings  that i have absolutely no idea why it is using up power so fast...even tho i attempted  the max power saving settings.
5 Samsung communication and support is abysmal on weekends.  The agent on Live Chat from overseas had no device to see and no information about it at all.  Wasted an hour with her and then she tried to transfer me to Smart Tutor but it was way to late at 7 pm Saturday Pacific time!
6 You cannot download itunes via wifi,
7 It is very large and awkward and shuts off easily  coz of  where the buttons are placed---so  one cannot use it w/o buying a cover/holder
8 It takes a special fast charging cord but it gets lost & mixed up in a big household and hard to remember which one it is.  Why not make it red or purple to stand out?.
9  the device flipped for a while  from desktop to desktop.  I dont know why  they have three home screens except they were needed to fit on all the bloatware icons!  Nothing is explained in writing --just strange logo icons,  I use this so rarely i cant remember what each one means .or all the steps to go thru.w/o consulting google search constantly..
When Samsung customer service didnt have a clue how to fix my home screen issue or how to put on a file icon for audio i eventually had to do a total factory reset  that took hours due to my music files.  I can hardly wait till  i will be able to get a pc expert to root this device so i will be able to install and uninstall what i want ! This is so unintuitive and  so confusing that i wish sincerely i had not bought it. Its not for non techies like me(smile)

PRO:s
1 Great picture!
2Amazing high def camera that is easy to use and makes beautiful photos and nice wallpaper for the homescreen and a great Gallery!
3 There are a number of colorful covers available on amazon that make its huge size easer to handle
4  It has lasted a year with no breakdowns or issues that i needed to go to pc repair shop.for
5Good replacement for a dvd player if you dont have a small laptop and have wifi available
6 Thaere are so  many factory apps that some have to be useful-- . such as sVoice. when you figure out the commands to say
7 It seems to have a huge amount of internal data storage space for Kindle audiobooks app and never had to juggle songs or delete apps to install new ones,
_______
Conclusions This device is ""neither fish nor fowl""  You get the approximate size of a small laptop without the flexibility and clear interface .  You do get a great camera but w/o the many advantages of  a much cheaper cell phone  --plus it is crammed with permanent bloatware --so why not just put out the money upfront for a high quality l laptop with windows 7 or 10 and save the annoyance?",
"I have been using an original iPad for about 4 years, and switched to an iPad air last year.  Each of those were $500 at the time I purchased them and held up great (iPad 1 still works well).  However, my two kids have basically taken ownership of those and I didn't want to spend another $500 on something with only 16gb of space.

Enter the Samsung Galazy Tab S 10.5.  Yes, it only has 16 gb of space, however it has a micro SD card slot, so I bought a 64 gb micro SD card and drastically increased the memory.  I can now actually have all my music and hours upon hours of videos without having to constantly manage them the way I did with the 16gb iPads.  I know apple sells iPads with larger space, but I don't want to drop $700 on a tablet.  I was able to find this tablet for $400 during the holiday season.

Pros:
1 - Beautiful screen - Videos look amazing and crisp.
2 - Can freely transfer movies/music via micro SD card.  I am no longer trapped to iTunes or CopyTransManager (great iTunes alternate).
3 - Multi-tasking ability - I find it pretty easy to jump around in the KitKat software.
4 - Torrent capabilities - I've heard that some people use torrents to download media, it can be done directly on this device and you don't have to work your way from PC>copytrans/itunes>tablet.  It can all be done on one device here.

Cons:
1 - My biggest concern so far is the lack or high volume.  The volume is fine for watching at home/car, but I fly alot and I'm worried it won't be loud enough to drown out the plane nose.  There are volume booster apps that help (22% increase IIRC). My favorite iTunes feature was that you could go to the movie properties and increase the volume 100%, that was a huge help on flights.

I really can't oversell the advantage Samusung has with the micro SD card option over the iPad, it makes everything so convenient, at least for my purposes of movies, music, and photos.",
"Every new Samsung tablet (and there have been already 13 different tablets released by Samsung just this year alone) is inevitably compared with the Apple iPad. The Tab S is so far a crowning achievement for Samsung and it is pinning it's fortune on the new Amoled display, which is simply put, gorgeous to look at. Amoled technology (unlike more conventional LCD which powers iPad and every other tablet on the market) does not rely on background lighting to assist display. Instead, each pixel (and there are more then 4 million on this tablet alone) can be individually lighted on demand. This translates to black colors that are true black and whites that are true whites. Resulting contrast is more then 1,000 times better then any leading LCD display on the market. This display is also more battery friendly and thinner then LCD which results in the record setting thinness of the entire tablet (only 6.6mm or .26""). Samsung Tab S display can go very bright in full sunlight to very dark in dark rooms at night. It is also easier on the eyes in the dark situation due to larger resolution and better contrast. You can read it in your bed at night without as much eye strain as other tablets. This display is revolutionary in the tablet market and Samsung should get all the credit for introducing it without additional price tag. So what about the rest of the tablet hardware?

- CPU: Samsung uses 2 quad core CPUs that are slightly beating Apple in-house CPU in benchmarks.

- RAM: 3GB of memory, compared to 1GB in Apple results in much better multitasking. iPad can perform marvelously when you are running just one App, but if you have many apps open and switch between them often, it simply can not keep up.

- Wi-Fi: Dual-band AC Wi-Fi chip that Samsung is using supports the latest generation of routers and results in faster internet speeds and further distance it can go from the router, compared to iPad. I have a large property around my house and have no problems connecting to internet from 100 yards away with still respectable speeds. Of course your results would vary depending on the number of walls between router and the tablet and your router specs.

- Battery: Samsung Tab S lasts me around 10 hours of general use (only light gaming, mostly browsing or streaming videos). Apple iPad in comparable scenario lasts around 12 hours. Kudos to Apple in-house CPU which is extremely power conscious and overall iOS more conservatively tuned compared to Android. Both tablets have very long life though.

- Weight: Samsung Tab S 10.5"" is much larger tablet vs latest iPAD Air yet it is lighter (even if by a hair). I use it without any cover and can comfortably grip with one hand for a long time.

- Sound: Tab S has two side facing speakers (in landscape mode which is natural for watching videos) with stereo sound. There are complains that they feel under-powered and lack bass. These complaints are justified. While speakers can go pretty loud when source provides aggressive soundtrack, a lot of movies go for a subtler approach and this tablet can not compensate. So games, music and TV shows are usually loud enough with good stereo separation, but many movies feel a bit quiet even at maximum sound. I caught myself many times trying to adjust sound when watching movies specifically.

- Other secondary specs are all in favor of Samsung. GPS, SD card slot that supports up to 127GB of extra on-board storage, fingerprint sensor for user login and support for multiple users (so you can safely share your tablet with your family), multi-window to run up to two different apps at the same time (for example watching movie and running browser on the side to read about actors/plot). Apple iPad has none of these features.

So why, you would ask I still rate latest Tab S at 4 stars instead of 5? It is all due to software and App ecosystem that truly differentiates Samsung tablets from Apple iPads. iOS is simpler to use compared to Android with Samsung TouchWiz interface on top of it. If you prefer to use your tablet as is and don't like learning and exploring all the features that it can provide, Apple gives you what you want. Android has been leapfrogging iOS in features and functionality for the past couple of years, yet Apple is not fighting this battle. It gives you one option where Android would usually provide 4 or 5, but this single option is better implemented then most of the Android alternatives. Samsung own interface (TouchWiz) and App marketplace tries to bridge that gap and fails miserably. Samsung just can't write good software. They throw more and more bells and whistles at you hoping that at least something would stick. Alas, even techies would turn most of these off after a day or two of playing. For the rest of the consumer mass it only adds confusion and additional learning curve. I would list just few of these features here: face tracking, side syncing, low power mode, hand gestures, etc. They all are only marginally helpful and mostly gimmicks.

Finally there is App ecosystem. If I can argue that Google marketplace has long caught app in Apps for smartphones, this is still not true for tablets where Apple marketplace still provides more and better refined options then Android. Most of the popular apps and games are present on both platforms. But developers prioritize iOS to Android due to better return on investment and wider, more affluent tablet audience with iPads compared to myriad of Android tablets. This results in many apps coming to iOS first and then ported to Android. And existing apps usually have better interface on iPad.

So here you have it. Great tablet, best display on the market bar none, cutting edge hardware and very good software that is better suited to non-conservative consumers that are willing to play with all that the tablet can provide vs only wanting to use it as is.
I would also add that you need to take a closer look at 8.4"" version of the same Samsung tablet. It is lighter, better fitting to one hand using and provides same hi-res Amoled display and identical hardware. If you spend more time reading compared to video watching, it is a better alternative. It is also $100 cheaper, which puts it in more budget-friendly territory.",
"I bought this tab through Amazon a few weeks ago, so far I am loving it. The look and feel as well as functions exceeded my expectations.

1. Design and appearance: as many review sites already mentioned, it has much better screen (AMOLED HD) than iPad Air, the resolution is about 20% higher. I was very impressed with how good video and pictures look on it. The screen is slightly larger than iPad, but the tab weights less (-0.4 oz off an already light weight). Overall design is slick and well-build - might be too shinny & slick though, it's hard to hold onto it.

2. Interface: initial set up is easy. the tab runs on a full Android system (v4.4), operation is smooth. I have been juggling different programs at the same time, there is no lagging. I tested the tab with Google Play Music, Spotify, Milk Music, HBO Go, You Tube, Netflix, etc. You can also use the ""Watch On"" app to control your TV and Set Top box (I tested with Att Uverse with great success). It has got 3GB RAM vs. iPad's 1GB, and 8MP rear camera vs. iPad's 5MP.

3. Connectivity: I happen to have a Samsung Smart Blu-ray player, which allows me to ""screen mirror"" the tab to TV through the BD player. The experience is tons better when you surfing the web, Facebook, YouTube, or other social sites than using the incumbent apps on your smart TV or BD player. The screen mirror does leave black bars on both sides of your TV screen, due to the mis-match of resolution between the tab and your TV. If you are not completely satisfied with this, you can try ""pair"" your tab with either your Samsung TV or BD player - this works only with some apps (I tested YouTube with success). Alternatively, you can try Google Chromecast to cast everything through HDMI port. The tab also connects well with my Android phone through ""sidesync"".

4. Expansion: one reason I choose this tab over iPad is that it comes with MicroSD slot. I bought a high speed SanDisk msd with 64G capacity for this tab, which is working well. For years Apple has been ignoring customer request for MicroSD ... they force the customer to choose different hard drive capacity, so they can charge more $$. I like very much Samsung leave the choice and flexibility to its customers.

5. Price: the tab is about :$80 to $120 cheaper than iPad Air (considering the memory expansion). I don't see how iPad can compete since the tab offer all functions and more than iPad.

6. Battery: not bad, but I hope it lasts longer and charge faster, one area for improvement.

Overall very satisfied.

---------------------------------
March 2016 Update

Everything still works well, however, I did find a major issue: with recent update of Android system, the feature of moving apps from internal memory to MicroSD card has been disabled for most apps. This means you will be running out of the 16G memory pretty fast, and makes the MicroSD expansion completely useless. However, based on my research, it is more a restriction implemented by app designers and Google Android, so it is a bit unfair to blame Samsung. Nevertheless, be aware of this issue if you plan to buy this tab.",
"I did a research for 2 months about tablets since I don't like to buy things by impulse... Since is a medium/large investment I wanted to be sure that this is what I need it... Currently I have a Samsung Galaxy S4 as a phone and a Macbook as a laptop.. Previously I had an Iphone 4s and an Ipad Retina Display which undoubtedly you can guess I was an apple user... But when I bought the Galaxy S4 I did it because I needed a flexible device with more space and I can't afford paying extra $100 for 16gb more on i-devices when you have android devices with memory card Slots which you can purchase 64gb for $30... Same happened with the tablet... I wanted a device that can replace what I normally do on the computer:
- facebook
- youtube
- email
- browsing
- downloading torrent
- watching movies (all formats mkv, avi, mp4, etc)
- watching or editing word docs
- listen to music
- playing casual games...

On the Galaxy Tab S I'm doing all that with plenty space or power to do more things... let me give you my review of the main point of this tablet:

Display: nothing more to add that hasn't been said... simply the best display on a tablet.... its look much better than my Ipad retina display (which I gift it to my GF), color on ipad look pale and wash out... people complaint that color on super amoled look over saturated... and even if they do... I don't get how people complaint about it when it just look better than any other devices..

Design: This is something that I don't care that much... since I'm not looking all the time at the back of the device... I'm looking at the screen... but feel like a premium device... is super thin... and lightweight.. Yep.. the Ipad look more premium with the metal cases.. but the Galaxy tab S doesn't feel cheap like other samsung tablets like the galaxy tab 3...

Power: The octa core processor work great.. I'm giving this device a very heavy use so far and I haven't felt any major hiccup or lag... yes sometimes It doesn't response right away like when you exit out of an app and want to open other app right away... but is just normal like any other premium android device... unfortunately this is how the OS works... don't get me wrong... is really fast and these so called hiccups or lag are barely noticeable and even if you noticed, its for about 2 secs then the tablet response is normally... It happened sometimes on my retina display Ipad as well... I guess this is normal for any device with... well.. ram... even computers have the same problem for over years...

Interface / OS: This has been the main problem with androids.. the ecosystem is not a fancy and good looking as the IOS and samsung touchwiz is not well optimized and look dull... I have to say that by far this is the best touchwiz experience that I had.. I still prefer how IOS look and feel over android, but this is a major improvement comparing it with my Jelly Bean Galaxy S4... kitkat touchwiz is on the right direction... but they are not quite there yet... the black and blue tones are something borring and the menu, settings, contacts, profile, etc.. haven't change since... well.. ever.... just minor touches but still look the same... I'm hoping for a major overhaul with android L... I hope that they change the interface on touchwiz... that since galaxy S1 is very similar to latest version... The magazine interface is good, but is laking of widget and customization.. I'm hoping on future versions that they allow us to select free feeds to add to the widgets since they only have a couple ""categories"" that I don't care that much like culture, bussiness, living, photos, travel.. etc... I don't see gaming or movies like on flipboard... and they only have twitter as a feed, I don't see facebook or instagram...

Apps: IOS has more tablet dedicated apps, but is not noticeable for my usage, email, youtube and browser are tablet friendly and that is what I use the most... facebook and all other work fine... even if they are phone versions... look and feel better than on my galaxy S4... android had the same problem with apps vs the app store a few years back and they catch up... they will do the same shortly with tablets.... Some apps doesn't work on my country like paper garden, milk music and most of the ""gift apps"" that come with the table... but is not a big deal for me...

Camera: haven't use it... I don't care about it..

FingerPrint scanner: This is a feature that I don't care that much but it Work 95% of the time... is a good ratio if you asked me... I heard some bad reviews that It never works... but is working fine for me...

Multi-Users: this is great... you can have 2 users on the same tablet like on computers... I'm not sure if there is a feature like this on IOS but is perfect for me, since I can have 2 accounts... one for me and one for my GF....

Multi tasking/ multi windows: Work perfect... this is another thing that IOS is missing... I was considering buying an Ipad Air over this... but even on IOS 8 there is no multi tasking... I use this a lot since I translate some documents... I had the translator app on top and the word app at the bottom and do my work directly from my galaxy tab S without even open my computer...

Battery: I head so many great things... but I had to say that battery is average.... I will say same or even a little less than the Ipad... don't get me wrong.. it last the whole day with normal usage... but it drain out the battery fast when I use my torrent app... or when I download anything...

Usage: perfect laptop replacement... I download some movies on it.. and watch them on any format... I have some movies and videos on my computer and I don't have to use the stupid itunes and a program to convert my avi movies to mp4 in order to transfer the movies to the tablet... I just simply copy them to my SD card.. and that's it... since I have Tab S I haven't use my computer only to do this review since involve a lot of typing... I'm just waiting for that keyboard case for this tablet and I'll be done.

Bottom line, is an excellent device if you plan to replace your laptop or use it less since is more confortable to do it from a tablet... I'm using my phone even less... since I prefer to browse facebook and twitter on the tablet than on the phone... the screen is amazing... better than any laptop/tablet I've ever seen... and the multi tasking and sd card slot are the catch that put me away from other IOS device... more tablet dedicated apps are coming daily on the play store... so is not a deal breaker over the ipad... and the ecosystem is getting in the right direction.. even touchwiz is looking better these days than previous versions....",
"So I bought this because I was looking for a reasonably priced computer with a big hard drive but wanted a solid state drive instead of the old type. This has 1TB of space which is a good start for me ?? It’s light weight but has a metal shell, so I don’t have to worry as much about another screen cracking mysteriously (I had 2 laptops that became unusable because the screens mysteriously broke on both of them within a 2 month period). The computer is super fast and even though it says it’s only 1080p I swear it looks as good as my 4K TV.

Now for the cons:
The track pad is positioned on this to where I am constantly clicking it and getting the right click pop up menu, which is annoying but I’m sure if I make adjustments it will be fine. It doesn’t have a DVR for reasons unknown but it seems that a lot of newer computers don’t come with one which can be annoying at times since I have a million and one DVRs laying around, everything  from movies to custom music “mixtapes” I’ve made through the years but it’s not a deal breaker or anything. For the price with the 1 TB SSD and the other things I was specifically looking for, it was a pretty good deal. The days of $300 laptops with everything you could want are over as precious minerals needed to make them become more scarce. Hopefully this will last me at least as long as my last one did which was around 8 years until my screen broke ??",
"The laptop included the upgrade to 20GB Ram and 512GB + 1TB ssd's. The computer is new so it's fast. The keyboard layout was easy to adapt to. There is bloatware but it hasn't gotten in my way yet and with the system resources the thing has it may be a while until I notice it.

The two downsides that I have seen at this point is the battery life. I run it on the high performance setting because, well, that's what I bought it for. It gets about 3.5 hours of battery before a warning with a fast shutdown.

The most surprising issue with this laptop is the identification of the keys. They aren't lighted and the color used for the letters and symbols is indistinguishable from the key in all but the most limited lighting situations. If you know your way around a keyboard without having to look for keys this isn't such a big deal but it is annoying.

Battery life however is short at about 3.5 hours if not using the lower performance settings.
I like the laptop but the keys are all but invisible.",
I originally got this this product for a college student that lost his parents the year before starting College and was facing financial hardship trying to take care of his little brother and go to college at the same time I'm happy to say since buying this item the individual graduated college top of his class and has since passed the laptop onto his little brother to help with his school work so that one day he may go to college and hopefully maybe use this computer so that he may graduate college as well I just wanted to say thank you to Amazon and all the sellers for not only offering affordable and high quality products but making dreams is such as owning a business graduating college or even having a birthday party come true I also want to thank Amazon in the sellers for making it possible for me to help others with life's hardships such as facing eviction Financial hardships disabilities and medical issues I have many more products I've yet to write a review on which I hope to get around to soon but nonetheless they have all improved somebody's life and from the bottom of my heart I think Amazon and all of the sellers that perform their duties to the best of their capabilities provide customers with positive and polite encounters and offers so many products at a reasonable and affordable price as well as items that last and give you past time to make more smiles and to make more dreams come true,
"This was a very disappointing purchase, after setting up all of the initial stuff, which was fairly easy the computer started an update, I get that this is common and proceeded to add email information, sync some other things, etc.  the screen resolution was amazing and I truly thought that I would enjoy this laptop....until I shut it down for the night, when I started it back up the next day I was unable to log in, my husband made several calls during the day while I was at work to see if it was something that could be fixed, we did a system reset and started the whole process of setting it up again....thought that two times would be a charm...boy was I wrong, exact same issue.  Google searches show that the problem we had is an ongoing issue with this system and there aren’t really any answers to help a novice like me to fix.  I have now returned it and decided to go with something that I know is reliable.",
"I received my Surface laptop but waiting three weeks before using it as I was in the middle of a project on my old computer.  Three weeks into use, there was a hardware malfunction; the keyboard and mouse stopped working. Microsoft more or less willingly sent me a replacement and, after a 10 day wait, I was ready to go again. This time, however, the new machine came with an ""S"" code which means that ONLY MS software can be installed on it. The tech people insisted I run a diagnostic only AFTER which they admitted there was a software problem that they would need to fix. Timeline on that? Sometime between now and whenever. Meanwhile, critical non-MS software is unavailable to me. MS is very sorry for my inconvenience and lost work time and they will get back to me via email...someday.

Meanwhile, the third party who sold me this electronic piece of fecal material told me to go whistle because their return policy was only for 30 days. Not their fault although they should at least warn people about the problem.

Finally, there is only one USB port which is weird and annoying. This means I had to purchase and carry with me a dongle that supports additional ports. Also, the machine lacks niceties like a fingerprint sign on. I am a bit sorry I did not look more carefully at the specs. Of course, the specs would not have clued me in on the larger hardware and software problems.",
"I've been a devoted Windows user since the early 90s. In parallel, and in counterpoint, I've also cycled through countless Windows laptops over the years, including Compaq, HP and Dell, and often been disappointed with the longevity of the machines. I nevertheless retained my affinity for the Windows operating system---so much so that when I purchased a MacBook Pro last year, I partitioned the disk and continued operating under Windows 10. I therefore greeted news of the Surface Laptop this spring---with its sleek and unitary design, and integration with other Microsoft products---with great enthusiasm. At last, I thought, the hardware would rise to the level of the software. The Surface Laptop would be Microsoft's answer to Apple.

Alas, upon buying the machine (indeed, the highest-end model), I found myself severely disappointed.

First of all, it ran noisy and hot right out of the box. Second, I could not even obtain a full-screen display on a standard Samsung external monitor (a defect which could not be resolved through a lengthy call to Microsoft Tech Support). How could Microsoft overlook such a basic requirement?

After several hours of struggling I put the machine back in the box and returned it for a full refund. From Microsoft, I expected much better.",
"This is a Microsoft laptop.  The description says it comes with Windows and Office, two Microsoft Products.  One would think that it is just a 30-day trial subscription.  And, they want you on Windows 365 and Office 2016--the latest Microsoft items.  As a consultant, I need a computere that is on the same platform as my client.  Microsoft Customer Service tried to figure out how I could get Office 2010 versus 2016....regardless, when we were close to thinking we might be successful, I asked the representative to stay on the line to make sure it worked.  They hung up.  It didn't work.  Relied on my former IT husband to Google his way around the issues.  It is not a great sync with my dear beloved Mac.  I've been using HPs/Compacts in the last three jobs.  My parents have issues all the time with their Surface, I blamed it on old age.  They blame it on frequent updates and having to resolve issues because of the updates.  Go figure.",
"I wanted a laptop with 16gb of ram and an Intel i7 processor - this one was recommended and price was manageable.  Yes, it is pretty, sleek and fast but after the first month I started having problems with it. The first time it crashed I was able to pinpoint the most likely cause as Windows updates. There were a few that failed, then laptop continually crashed, had to re-build my profile twice. It slowly went downhill from there. None of the drivers would update. I know my way around a laptop (spent my career supporting workstations and laptops) so I started with the simplest fix and worked my way up. Could not reset or restore. Fortunately I purchased a warranty and they put me in touch with a very knowledgeable person at Microsoft and we re-built from scratch  to Windows 10 Pro (10.0.19042 build 19042). Everything has been fine for a while but now it randomly crashes with an error of ""WHEA uncorrectable error"" which fortunately doesn't harm my profile but is almost impossible to identify the cause. I've run tests on memory and the hard drive and they seem to be fine. Very annoying and unstable, and this is the laptop I have to use for the next few years? I'm ready to go back to my old. slow HP Elitebook. Not a happy camper.",
"Having used a surface pro 3, then 4 for the past few years I was ready to try the new surface laptop. The surface book was a bit too heavy . With the sp4's I opted for the i5 with 16gb ram to extend battery life. Also the i7 on the surfaces pro 4 were getting too hot. With the surface laptop I ended up with a i7, 16gb ram it's a bit pricey but it's a work horse and probably best laptop I've had for travel.

I do miss the sp4's ability to remove the keyboard and adjust the rear especially in the plane when I can stick it in the seat pocket. Also a bit getting used to having the dock/power mount on the bottom near the keys vs the screen on the sp4.

The bigger screen and better keyboard is a nice welcome after so many years with a surface pro

For power users I would also recommend the stylus, a usb3 Ethernet adapter as it also provides 3 usb3 slots and an 'active' mini displayport to HDMI .

I do wish it had a usb-c slot sometimes .",
Had issues charging it after unboxing it. Found out that it needed to be updated and I guess part of the updates were a fix for the charging issue. After downloading the updates it wouldn’t install then since it’s not plugged in. Well it’s plugged in but it’s got issues. So I took a can of air duster and pray the charging port a little and it did the trick and starting charging. After it installed the updates and rebooted. The charging issue was gone. This laptop is not upgradable. It scored a score of 0 out of 10 on ifixit. Don’t game with it. You’ll be disappointed. But light gaming will work fine like Minecraft. Surprisingly it was able to play GTA V decently. But I wouldn’t push it. This is a very premium device. It looks great and feels great. You’ll like the keyboard as well. I got the burgundy color. It looks really nice in person. So if you’re in the market for one. I would avoid getting the ones with 4gb of ram. 8gb of ram is the sweet spot for today’s use.,
"To start off, I was supposed to get a $200 gift card for the purchase of this item, which I didn't, and Amazon would not work with me regarding the promotion (which is the only reason I considered buying this laptop). I will not judge the actual item based on my poor experience with Amazon.

This laptop is great. I took naturally to the touchscreen, but you can function on the laptop without the touchscreen (I realize some people do not like to ""ruin"" the screen). Some things may bother you though.

NO CD ROM. I lucked out in that I could download all the previous apps I had, but if you require a CD, you will need to buy an external CD ROM drive to run the apps, and to burn CD's.

ONLY 1 USB PORT. So I had to buy a splitter. Personally bought it to be able to use a mouse and keyboard, although I find it comfortable typing on the laptop's keyboard.

Overall, I've had it for over a month and I love it. No major problems, very fast so long has you have a decent internet condition. I have a lot of apps and files that I transferred with no problem and the computer is still running great.",
"The last laptop that I had was the Lenovo Yoga 2 so it had Windows OS. When I was looking for a new laptop (I had my Lenovo for a little more than 4 years) I narrowed it down between the Microsoft Surface Laptop and the Google Pixelbook. Both laptops were around the same price (the Pixelbook is slightly cheaper than the Surface), with similar specs. At first, I was leaning more towards the Pixelbook because of the slightly cheaper price, but I didn't like that the Pixelbook was a 2-in-1 (my Lenovo is also a 2-in-1 and while I liked this feature at first, it ended up becoming a problem down the road). I also read some reviews about the Pixelbook that said there were some software issues. All the reviews that I read about the Surface were extremely positive with only minor complaints that seemed as though they would be irrelevant for me. Because I was relying heavily on past reviews (I live in the middle of nowhere and was not able to make the drive to view either laptop in person) I ended up going with the Surface despite the higher price and I have absolutely no regrets.

The Surface is sleek and smooth and I LOVE that there are multiple colors to choose from! The fabric-covered keyboard is sooo soft and smooth, and the laptop itself is unbelievably thin! The Surface ticks all the boxes for me, and although I cringed at spending this much on a laptop, I am so glad that I did!

The only thing that I would note is that there is only one USB port, which isn't an issue for me, but I know some people prefer more than one. Other than that, I can think of no complaints thus far.",
"I got this laptop about a month ago and I LOVE it (there's a pros and cons list at the bottom of review). I needed something portable, quiet, and with good battery life because I am a college student. It's very light and I like the stylish design. I wanted a laptop that's aesthetically pleasing and has good specs. I can even play minecraft with my brothers without any issues. The laptop does get a bit hot when running minecraft or running multiple programs at once but the fans are always quiet usually making no noise at all. I went from a huge, heavy old dell to this laptop and it's great. It makes my life so much easier. Also on the power brick there is an extra USB port which I sometimes plug my phone into to charge. I've never seen that feature before and it's surprisingly handy.

The only issue I've had is with the trackpad. There's some visible wear on the trackpad already.  However, it doesn't really bother me as it's very minor and you can only really see it in a certain light. Other than that the trackpad has worked fine. A possible issue could be that there is only one USB port which I don't mind at all. But if you use more than one at a time then this laptop may not be for you.

Pros: Light, good battery, very quiet, fast, aesthetically pleasing, powerful considering it's lightweight design
Cons: trackpad wear, one usb port, gets hot when running multiple programs",
"I've been a Mac User for more than 15 years.  The price convinced y to try a Surface.  Works beautifully, reacts promptly, amazing touch screen, wakes up fast  and it is very light.  The keyboard is  backlit  so you can work in the dark and the  touch pad is a smooth as Apple's.  However, unlike Apple,  Microsoft is aggressively pushing  its own products.  The browser Edge works nicely and you can select which  search engine the  can use. (The default search engine is Bing.)  The AI helper Cortana uses only Bing. At  this moment  Cortana is less impressive than Google's Assistant. It is still very useful.

Microsoft is also offering a competitive cloud  cloud subscription.  At my job  I have to use Google cloud products (Drive,  Sheets, Documents). Also I have an Android Phone and  Google Photo  helps me sync my photo collection. These products  don't work as smoothly on the Surface.  At this moment you cannot even install the Chrome browser  on  Surface. (I read that Chrome is more energy consuming than Edge and can shorten the battery life.)  I do not need Microsoft cloud service since I already use two platform independent services  Google Drive and  Dropbox. I don't need  all the facilities of  Office 363 (the new Microsoft Office) since I can live very well with what  Google is offering freely.  I  don't know yet how Dropbox works with Surface.

Given the current deliberate  incompatibility with the Google products I need I gave Surface only four stars. If Microsoft  fixes this I will upgrade my rating to five stars  and switch to Surface.T hen again, I hear that Apple  will present this Fall the new generation of Mac Book Air.",
"First of all, i want to start by expressing how much i liked the product, its looks and feels like a solid midrange laptop for everyday use. The design is sleek and simple, i was disappointed with the fact that it is difficult to find a simple laptop that doesn’t cost an arm and a leg. All in all i liked the laptop, a lot! *The rating is for the product* not the for the story below

However, the main purpose of this review is not about the laptop’s performance, design etc... its about how I got scammed and was sent a laptop with specs that I didn’t order.

So the story goes like this, i get on amazon, I add a Microsoft surface laptop (i5, 8 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD) to my cart, i place the order, several days later I get the package, i set up the laptop started checking it out. I had a feeling that i should check out the computer’s spec, you know just curious. I was shocked when i found out that the specs of the laptop were (i5, 4 GB RAM and 128 GB SSD!!!!!!!) i was really confused, i double check the label on the back of the box and saw that it says (i5, 8GB RAM, 256 GB SSD), but the laptop has different specs, and what is more confusing is that the serial number of the laptop matches the number on the box. So to me it seemed like it was an attempt to pull a quick one on me. I ended up returning the laptop of course... I am still disappointed that such scam attempts could happen on amazon!

Check your laptops everyone! Don’t get scammed like i did.",
"I know most people cringe when thinking about Microsoft hardware.  There have been some massive failures over the years.  Remember around the time of the first iphone, the Windows Phones on AT&T?  What a mess.  Remember trying to update them?  The Surface line of tablets have actually been pretty good, but in the end most people either just want a really good tablet or a good laptop.  The surface laptops have filled a nice need which is a speedy laptop that is super slim and can act like a tablet as well.  As long as you get the model with at least a core i5, 8 gigs of RAM and 256 SSD, the surface laptop performs great.  You can hold it with 2 or 3 fingers and fits in a tablet sleeve.  I have one of these myself and we have sold about 20 of them for our employees and clients and have had very few issues so far.  The finish on the laptop looks nice, but it can show some fingerprints or new to be wiped off after a lot of use.  The reason I am taking off a star is because of the confusion and frustration of having these laptops ship with Windows 10 S.  I won't bore you with what Windows 10 S is, suffice to say that it is a stripped down version meant for large rollouts and not suitable for most people.  It's true that you can switch to Windows 10 Pro for free, but it's super confusing for people that don't know how or why they need to do that.  Overall while not perfect, for the price the surface laptop is a great choice.",
"I could not connect my Surface to a shared printer (see below).  My time with Microsoft support did not resolve my issue.  Printing is important, and I felt the 2 stars was deserved for a product I might have had to return.

After a few hours of working with it, I was able to resolve my problem.  This is what I experienced.  Your Surface may not experience the same issue.  It might have been a one off, or a bug of some kind.

My 5 existing computers had the ""Workgroup"" name changed to ""XXXXXXXXX"".  After updating the Surface to WIndows Pro at the Microsoft Store, I changed the ""Workgroup"" name to match the other 5.  At that point, it failed to connect to a shared printer.  Long story short, I set the ""Workgroup"" name back to ""WORKGROUP"" on the Surface and the computer with the printer attached, and it worked!

So, I changed the ""Workgroup"" name back to ""XXXXXXXXX"" on those 2 computers, and it failed to connect to the shared printer again!

I changed all 6 computers so the ""Workgroup"" is named ""WORKGROUP"" and all is good.  This should not have been an issue, but I'm glad I got mine working.

We love the laptop.  It has a great screen size, it is light, and it is quick.  Not excited with my support call with Microsoft, but the important thing is it works now.

ORIGINAL POST:
It started off really nice.  Fast, smooth, it looks great, etc.  Then I tried to connect it to a shared printer on another computer in my home.  It failed.  Over and over again.  I called Microsoft.  The young lady was patient and nice, but went through a series of tests that had nothing to do with my issue.  I requested my call be escalated, and after a few minutes, she came back on and tried a few additional steps.

She had me connect the printer directly to the laptop.  It worked (Who saw that coming????)!  Then she said ""we have it working.  Is there anything else we can do for you?""  I could have done this.  The laptop REFUSES to recognize a shared printer on the network.  I have a Surface Pro 3, a Surface 1, an HP desktop and an HP laptop, ALL which can connect to the printer that is USB'd to another HP desktop.  Microsoft basically REFUSED to escalate my issue even after I said I was sending it back.

It's sad to give it a 2 star rating for a printer issue, but we like to print.  It is not an option.  Someone might say it is a printer issue.  It is not.  There is a network sharing issue with ""MY"" Surface Laptop.  Maybe not yours, but mine has an issue.  It is also sad that Microsoft wouldn't at least attempt to resolve this.

I may return this if I can't find a printer solution.  I'll update in a couple of weeks.",
"I'm only writing this to warn off anyone from purchasing a surface laptop--lord know I'll never buy one. I bought the laptop two years ago. The surface worked fine for the first year, though I had periodic charging issues, especially with the magnetic cable clip. The clip won't engage, sometimes you have to prop it up or tape it. The problems got worse, and just when the warranty expired (a year and half), I had major issues charging the laptop. So I bought another cable, which worked for a while, then bought another, and the problem continued. I had two conversations with microsoft techs, who convinced me to buy another cable--considering, if I wanted to send the laptop for repair, the price would be more than I paid for it, so they really gave me no possible solutions, other than buying a new one, and were really gaslighting me that any fix actually existed. Of course, why would I ever purchase another microsoft product. The Lenovo laptop, which I bought the Surface to replace it with, is still working five years later--only issue I had is with a hinge.

I've taken it to various repair shops and they tell me there's nothing they can do to fix it, that basically, microsoft made the surface to be disposable, and any effort to fix the laptop would far exceed the price to purchase a new one--planned obsolescence. From what I researched, what brought about the charging issue was some update I failed to download, and once the battery lost power,  it couldn't be charged, or even powered with the cable plugged in.

I've given up on this pos. I'm looking for a field where I can take it out and demolish it like the printer from Office Space, or possibly a parking garage I can drop it from. Maybe a wood chipper. I'm weighing my options. All said, don't buy a surface laptop, this is where you'll be two years later.",
"I've had my Microsoft Surface Laptop for about a month now and I genuinely could not be happier with my purchase. After weeks of research and stress trying to find the perfect laptop I stumbled upon this beauty. It was worth the wait and stress or research. It's amazing.

The keyboard is out of this world. It's so comfortable to type on. I love it.

The i7 core processor is amazing. I can run Photoshop, Spotify and a bunch of browsers without it slowing down.

Battery life is phenomenal.

The screen is great. The touch screen works amazingly too.

I got the Burgundy and it's even cuter in person. It's sort of punk pinkish. I love it. The material on the inside is nice, I'm not sure how it will wear eventually but in the meantime it's been great and comfortable.

You won't regret your purchase!

EDIT: almost 2 years later and this computer still works like a charm!!! the fabric inside isn’t worn down and i work from home on it, literally 8 hours a day m-f for the last 2 years! it’s not as new looking, but still in pretty great shape! still runs super fast, amazing. battery life isn’t as strong but not a deal breaker",
"UPDATE: So, I'm about two weeks in now and have had a bit of time to run a few photoshoots into my Lightroom catalog to get an idea of what this laptop can handle and I'm a bit less than ecstatic. I'm not knocking a star off because Adobe recommends 12gb of ram to run Lightroom smoothly, so its no fault to Microsoft that I started to have some slow-downs when I got my catalog up around 1,000 images with synced settings, 1:1 previews, and adjustments gradients and brushes on many files. I've got my cache set to 90gb and it just tends to really chug when I need to do more than basic adjustments. Outside of heavy lightroom use and sluggishness, the laptop absolutely flies with just about anything else. I really don't have a complaint to share. It's been a dream.

This laptop is fantastic. I bought the i5 256/8gb model with the gray/gold coloring. First thing that amazes is the weight. Just over two pounds makes this thing feel so incredible to carry around. I almost feel like it's a large phone sometimes. The design is sleek and minimalist. The speakers are loud and full and rich. The battery life is is superb. I may have a warped view on that because of the terrible battery on my old laptop, but I seem to notice 7-8 hours battery life depending on the usage. I bought this for Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop use, but haven't had much time to put it through a lot of work so I will update when I know just how well it performs there.

The only minor dislike is that the hinge is a little wobbly. For being touchscreen, it seems like it should have a stiffer hinge, but it's quite bouncy.",
"I've had this laptop for about three months, and this is the second laptop (after the Rose Gold MacBook), that I have looked forward to using day in and day out. It is a weird feeling, being in love with your laptop. Most of us have probably own at least 6 laptops in our lifetimes, so you can understand where I'm coming from when I say most of us use our laptops in a utilitarian sort of way: We use it because we need to, and when we don't, we just put it away without any thought. If you want a big screen, or to play games, you would use your desktop. When you want something portable, you would most likely use your tablet. When you want something on the go, we have all used our smartphone as our main day-to-day gadget. So that leaves our laptop, as more of a business machine for doing something that requires typing on the go, whether it be to reply to an important email you can't just use your phone for, or to type out something on Word or Google Docs. For many of us, browsing the Net just isn't as satisfying on our small phones, even if it is some 6.2"" monster. There is something tactile, yet intangibly indescribable, about using our laptop

Yet, this is the first Windows laptop that makes me look forward to using it each day. The main culprit: Oh that gorgeous piece of metal and color. To be honest, if it just came in silver like its Surface Book counterpart, I would have never given it a second thought (by the way, I have that too, but its novelty has since worn off). I got the Burgundy version, which is just so unique - where else can you get a wine red laptop?? Each time I open its laptop sleeve and pull it out, I have to pause a moment to admire its chiseled look first, before propping it open and using it. Not only does it look great, it feels great too. As you run your fingers through it, you will appreciate that you have one of the most luxurious laptops ever. No that is not a hyperbole.

Another thing that make it stands out: The stereo speakers underneath the keyboard is the best I have ever heard in a laptop (I am overseas right now, and my Huawei Matebook X awaits at home with its Dolby Atmos Harmon Kardon speakers, so I'll do an update soon). It is loud and immersive - it can't get too loud where it would create aural distortions, so at its peak it is just awesomely loud and clear enough. I have a keyboard protector over it, but I always take it off when I have some audio playing - yes, the sound is that good.

Touchscreen laptops might be a gimmick, but having it is never a negative. It is perfect for scrolling web sites. Once you use it that way, you'll never go back to scrolling with your mouse or trackpad again.

Speaking of the trackpad, it's supposed to have the Windows Precision software aspect, but it still is goofy most of the time. Scrolling, switching, zooming, etc., still isn't as good as any MacBooks.

And speaking of the keyboard and keyboard cover, key travel and sponginess are excellent. However, the keys are a bit more slippery than I would like, so I definitely recommend one of those gel keyboard covers to help you type more precisely.

The screen is bright and excellent - one of the best screens I have used. The resolution isn't as crisp and nice as my Surface Book and Macbook, but definitely better than most.

About that whole Alcantara-layered interior - yes it is beautiful, yes it feels great (no more cold palms in the winter). Just keep it clean (no eating potato chips while using it).

Finally, the i5 and 8GB of RAM are good enough to avoid any hiccups in performance of your every usage of a normal laptop. This is not for gaming or video rendering, so if you are not expecting that, then this laptop's performance will not disappoint.

The bottom line is you will buy this laptop for its looks, period. There is no value for this laptop - it is targeted as a premium-level laptop, not a value-level laptop. Any other normal laptop with these specs would be about $200 less. So you just have to ask yourself if the burgundy or slate blue color, and the style of design/craftsmanship are worth it for you.",
"I bought this laptop in June of 2019.  This is the 1st generation of the Surface laptop and I got it for a great price because the 2nd generation was rolling out.  My Surface laptop is Cobalt Blue with the Core i7, 8GB RAM, and 256GB hard drive.  Got it for $725.  This was a great price in my mind and why I went with it.  I was looking at some cheaper laptop models (in the $400-$500) range, and wasn't really considering this level of laptop because it is normally in the $1000-$1500 range.  But at $725 I decided to pay a bit extra for the better quality.

One of the most notable differences of moving up to a laptop like this is the design.  It is nice and slim, and looks great.  This was important to me because I wanted something fairly sleek and compact that I could just put in my backpack and go (not a student, but I always have my pack).

The screen is great and I love the 3:2 aspect ratio.

As I'm typing this review, I can tell you that the keyboard is as good as people say it is.  It's got great spacing and the button press is nice and deep for a laptop.  This was big because I'm used to typing on a mechanical keyboard.  The Alcantera surface is a nice touch.  It is a smooth and soft feel and is something that separates it from competition.  Some people have stated that it leaves some oil marks after months of use, but I've mostly seen that in the light grey color.  We'll see what it does having the darker blue color.

The touchscreen works great.  I haven't purchased a Surface pen, but plan to in the future.  The trackpad is also great and gives a nice satisfying click.

The facial recognition for login is accurate and really fast.

I will typically use my Bluetooth earbuds, but I was surprised at how clear and nice the speakers on this sounded.

Overall, this laptop looks and feels like a great laptop and performs very well.  I have had a Macbook Air for my job for the last 2 years, and this is just as good a laptop. In fact, it is probably a bit better because of the little things like a better keyboard and personalized colors.  At the price I got it for, I would definitely recommend this laptop.

Also, I should state that a lot of reviews for this laptop talk about the Windows S operating system being installed on it.  That is no longer the case.  My laptop came pre-loaded with Windows 10 Pro.",
"Okay, so far running well however, if this is a “New” laptop that has been updated why does it have a Knick on the cover?! In addition, when looking at the Warranty, it says that I have 4 months, give or take a few days, left on it. You have to ask yourself that if it’s a New laptop, then why is a 1 year mandatory Warranty left with only 4 months?! The above description is deceiving and should not be allowed. No where on the original description of the product on Amazon does it indicate that it’s a “used” laptop or that it’s a New Lenovo ideapad 3 8Gb with 256 or 512 Gb RAM” that is being updated to 20 Gb with 1Tb”. It states that they are “New”! This needs to be corrected and a clear precise description of what the purchaser is actually buying needs to replace what is currently on Amazon. It so far appears to be a good product and if the company is filling a demand and pricing it accurately, should be honest and forthright about their product unless they have something to hide. I would love a response to the questions posed here as I do not have immediate plans on returning the laptop as long it continues to function as it should. I will continue to update this review to keep customers informed.
Update:
After 10 months of owning this computer, realized the battery does not hold the charge. You can charge it completely one day and a week later, you need to plug it in because it’s threatening to shut off. They added some things and forgot others, like an updated battery or maybe it was done on purpose since we all know that they were not honest enough to inform potential buyers that their computers were technically used.",
"I bought 5 of these for our employees at work. They are incredibly slow to the point of having a loss of production. I had to purchase additional memory (32 GB for each of the computers) and then that wasn't enough to keep the hard drive spinning. When you have been spoiled by SSDs it's really hard to go back to HDDs.  I have since purchased 5 SSD's to replace the antiquated HDD that is currently installed on the laptops. What started out as a deal on some good equipment has turned into a need to upgrade immediately after purchasing and replacing parts that should be a lot more modern and ready to run current OS specs, especially since that's how it was shipped. Very disappointed in the performance.

*****UPDATE*****

I have installed the memory (32 GB) and the SSDs (480 GB). The computers are running much better and are very efficient. They are capable of more and should have been shipped as such. At least we are functional again.",
"I think Happy Ranger did a great job. The laptop came in excelent condition with the exact same model I ordered.

I wanted a laptop to play videogames and work. With this laptop I could play Cyberpunk in ultra with no lag to give an example of how good it is.

Now I'm going to mention the things I don't like. But this is mostly stuffs with ASUS.

It heats a lot. It can easily go to 90°C very fast. Of course, this laptop have some configurations to speed up / activate the fans which can hold it and I won't go father than that. Also, most games won't have this problem. You can always buy a cooling pad so this isn't big deal.

The battery. Just working as a programmer works around 2-3 hours using linux on balance. Gaming last around 1-2 hours depending on what you are playing. If you use the special configurations on windows it can last a bit more but isn't a big difference.

The screen of the laptop have some weird colors. You can make some configurations but it won't look perfect. My old laptop had a better quality screen. It has a HDMI so you can avoid this problem an use a real monitor.

Despite this little problems, I'm very happy with what I brought.",
"This is a great, powerful machine. My word of caution is that its battery life is awful. On battery saving mode with the touchscreen turned off, an hour of light programming depletes a third of the battery. This is likely due to its powerful processor combined with the display. I could see this being a good fit for someone who will primarily use it at a workstation where it’s constantly connected to power, or someone who is usually near an outlet to charge.

Additionally, the computer gets very hot after an hour of use. I would suggest getting a cooling fan or elevating it so the fans on the bottom can circulate a bit more. This is also likely due to the compact case in addition to the powerful processor. This leads me to believe the processor power is not being fully utilized due to the heating issues.

If you already have a bigger machine and are getting this for on-the-go, I would go for the i5 and the base display. The display quality won’t matter on this size and you won’t notice the difference in processor speeds because of the overheating issues I mentioned earlier.

Overall, it’s a beautiful machine and I love the size and weight of it. It feels solid and the display quality is amazing. I can have multiple IDEs open, running a local dev server, tests, and browse the web without worrying about lag. I use it mostly at home on the couch or in bed, with it plugged in so the battery problem sucks but isn’t a dealbreaker. The cooling issue is something I have with my MacBook Pro as well, so a cooling fan has been a good investment regardless.",
"This a laptop was absolutely perfect. The touchscreen was great, really fast, was very comfortable to type, incredible design. This laptop just looked so premium in features and appearance. However, you could feel so much heat coming from the bottom that in half an hour I couldn't bear it upon my legs. And the most important downside was, it had really poor battery performance. It couldn't last more than 3 hours of battery life, even sometimes lasted only 2 and a half hours just using web browsing. No video streaming or any other demanding application. I contacted Dell and they said that this is the battery life time it is supposed to have (which I don't entirely believe, and contradicted what they say in their product website). They changed battery and problem still persisted. At the end they proposed to change both hard disc and motherboard, when in that point, I finally decided to return it to the seller for receiving full refund. It was heartbreaking for me to return it because I loved this laptop. However, this battery issue was unacceptable for me because it completely took any portability off from the laptop. I don't know whether any other laptop of this model has the same issue or I just got unlucky.",
"Screen works fine initially, but eventually (it was apparently the disney plus app that did it to me) flickers and dies. then it goes off and on and off and on just conitually more glitchy. Sure it comes back to a usable state, but for $1,500 dollars I shouldn't have had that issue at all with this computer.
in addition, the frame around the screen is narrow and seems like it would not be very protective. be very careful not to flex or break that or you'll easily damage your screen if it doesn't glitch first. I was super disapointed, I really loved this computer otherwise, but a glitchy screen isn't worth the money even with so much gaming power behind it.

Also this thing runs WAAAY hot. like 175 degrees Fahrenheit hot and it only stays below that on 'silent' mode so there's no point to running it in turbo cuz youd melt the keyboard. I could have probably cooked an egg on this thing's vents.  again, a shame cuz its otherswise got great specs. but not worth it.",
"There is a known problem with the cheap Meditek wi-fi cards they installed on these.  After spending dozens of hours on forums reading about 100's of people with the same problem, it's not clear if it's just janky hardware, or Asus just can't get the BIOS to work properly with the card.  Every time windows updates, be prepared for endless wi-fi problems which will eventually be fixed by a BIOS update from Asus.  Asus refuses to acknowledge the problem, and will not send you a replacement card.  Their customer service completely stonewalled me, and pretended they had never heard of the problem before, even though it's been going on for over a year now.  The only real fix seems to be to just get an intel ax200 replacement.  They're around $30.  Obviously not a huge expense, but ALOT of time wasted with Asus customer service getting no result, then hours spent on the forums trying to solve it myself.  Won't buy an Asus again.",
"I purchased this Asus TUF Dash 15 from the ""Lucky Tech, LLC"" Amazon store. I have had issues for the last month with the machine crashing/locking up sporadically with increasing frequency. I thought it might be a bad video display driver. So, I made sure everything was up-to-date but the problem persisted. I did a few system restores, some from the local Windows copy and some from the cloud.  I spent a lot of time trying to isolate what the problem might be. While this was going on, I noticed disk errors starting to show up in the System event logs. At this point, I really thought it is a hardware issue. I reached out to Asus for support and they sent me a link to create an RMA. However, when I tried to create an RMA, it said I needed to go to Best Buy. I went to Best Buy and, even though I am a Total Care member, they would not honor the warranty because I did not buy the laptop there.  I reached out to ""Lucky Tech, LLC"" about this and they directed me back to Best Buy, even though I clearly told them in writing on multiple occasions that ""Best Buy would not honor the warranty because I did not buy the laptop."" The only thing that makes sense is that they are reselling laptops they buy from Best Buy and the warranty is not transferrable.

Bottom line, I am the proud owner of a $1700 boat anchor. This is really impacting my business. I would not do business with this seller.",
"Worth every penny. I'm actually writing the review on this laptop (physically using) 8 months later! So needless to say I have broken it in. Full disclosure, I modded this right out of the box. I added in an additional M.2 for another 2TB of space and upgraded to 64GB (2x32) of RAM. The SSD and RAM ran me about $250 (USD) and it was breeze to install. The laptop runs great, no cooling issues, no frame drops or lag. I cannot speak to the battery life because this lives on the desk next to my workstation and I have not traveled with it. But lets be honest, no one games aggressively at the coffee shop. If you are playing an intense, power demanding game you are likely sitting at home. If you don't want the bulk of a PC tower and you want to sit anywhere in the house on your computer than this is the best there is for you. The cherry on top is that this is from ASUS and in over 10 years of using their products I have nothing but great things to say about the company and what they produce.",
"This is the second ASUS machine I have tried to use.  The first machine was returned due to a problem with the WIFI being totally inoperable.  I fought with that machine for about a week before returning it.
As I really like the first machine overall, I decided to give the ASUS TUF series another try and went with a bit of an upgrade from the first machine.
Initial start up and Windows 10 set up went flawless and easy.  Wifi connected quick easy and fast.  From my first experience I was able to go through and do a lot of basic setup with the ASUS utilities and basic Windows preferences.
Everything worked fine until the first BIOS update to version 309 installed.  After that the wifi became quite erratic.  It might or might not connect.  When it doesn't connect, the wifi won't display any networks at all.  In some cases the hardware will shut down and there won't even be a WiFi option.
Pros
It is a big screen and decent keyboard.  Backlighting is somewhat programmable for overall color and there are apparently some basic special effects that can be turned on with the ASUS Armory Crate utility.  In this instance the machine came with 16G of memory, 6G of graphics memory and a 1T SSD.  I never really got to try out the gaming or usability of the machine as the WiFi not working is a deal breaker.

Cons
The NUM LOCK key has no visual light or marker to indicate if it is on or off.  A small LED like the Caps Lock would have been fine, but it has none so you have to find out the hard way.
Once all the basic Windows 10 stuff is set up from original install/set up the machine runs quite well and was a lot faster than the first machine I had.  When Windows 10 starts doing the upgrades/updates, DO NOT ALLOW THE BIOS UPDATES!!!!!!!!!!!  The WiFi problems are due to faulty bios starting with versions 309.  Versions 310 and 312 completely shut down the ability for the wifi to work at all.  If you don't have a Cat5 cable to plug in for internet, you will be out of luck.

Heat.  This is a powerful machine and the processors generate a lot of heat.  There should have been some kind of built in stand offs on the underside to give more air space under the fans.  As it is designed it sets too close to a smooth flat table for enough air to flow.  It really needs a laptop cooler if you plan on doing any real gaming.  If it has about 3/4 of an inch under the machine at the top end, it seems to stay fairly cool if you have the fans running at all.  (I actually can't hear them myself)

I will probably be returning this to Amazon.  I would not recommend ANY of the ASUS computers at this time due to the BIOS WiFi issue.  For me, the lack of WiFi access makes this a boat anchor.  Of course ASUS isn't really saying anything about this ocean liner slamming into an iceberg.
Be aware that there are a lot of ""make do"" fixes online for the ASUS WiFi issue.  I suspect it is going to be worse before it is better.
The first machine started having problems the first evening.  Through the following week the WiFi became more and more erratic until it just wouldn't work at all.
At this point THIS macnine is ONE DAY OLD and the wifi is completely shut down.",
"This laptop is FAST. I have a dual XEON server for editing video but am finding myself doing more and more work on this laptop. Because It’s also very fast at editing video.

It has a great feature that automatically switches between the default Intel GPU (energy/battery saving) for everyday tasks and switches to using the discrete NVIDIA RTX3060 (performance) in games and heavy video editing.  You can manually specify in the NVIDIA Experience app to run specific games ONLY using the NVIDIA GPU because sometimes it will try to use the slower default GPU. For most windows tasks the Intel GPU is great.

 It does run hot, so I would recommend a laptop cooler if you going to play demanding games. The fans do a great job at pumping the heat outside the laptop. However, It must have plenty of ventilation underneath to allow proper airflow. Extremely warm air is ejected from three places (left side rear, right side rear and right side.

The fans (x2) when in silent mode are just that … silent. However in turbo mode they are very loud. Not a big deal for me because I use noise canceling headphones that totally eliminate the fan noise.

I upgraded the RAM in this laptop soon after purchase from 16GB (2x8GB) to 32GB (2x16GB). This is the kit I purchased and confirm that they run at full 3200MHz speeds with timings of CL 20 RCD 22 RP 22 RAS 42 on a JDEC profile.

"Although I didn't buy this from Amazon, this is the laptop my work has provided me and I love it so much I'm starting to save up to buy my own & figured I'd add my review in the meantime. In the last five years of my career, this truly has been the best laptop I have used. It's fast, it's got a beautiful image resolution, it's lightweight, and there hasn't been a single issue with it in the last two years. Even being a Apple/IOS over-consumer, I prefer using this laptop over my personal mac computer because the software doesn't get outdated as fast, the camera is better, it's overall clearer, brighter and more sleek in my opinion.

The laptop keyboard includes buttons to easily lock the camera off so I don't have to worry about accidentally turning my camera on in a meeting when I'm still in my pjs. For similar reasons, I also like that there's a mute button on the keyboard as well as volume & brightness keys. My millennial brain still needs the satisfaction of a clicking-key keyboard and I'm able to use my usb/bluetooth paired keyboard & mouse without issues.

The price is not ideal but like I said, I'm saving up to buy one for my own personal use because I can't recommend this laptop enough!",
"Positive:
Touchscreen and pad works perfectly
Keyboard and speaker and camera works well
Small and modern and super stylish
If it’s only been a bit newer condition, I’d probably keep it.
But I’ve bought another Dell latitude and it came super mint condition. I only needed it for work sometimes, really, so I was not looking for anything fancy like the XPS.

Negative:
I got the XPS since description says Grade A and I really wanted to keep it.
But here’s the minor issues:
there’s several scratches around the laptop. It’s also not very well cleaned. (See photos) Since it’s metallic covering, you can feel the dents like a sore thumb. The charger showed well-used and actual bent as seen on one of the pictures.  The charging port/opening has a lot of scratches (photos). I think the sd slot will not work since it’s full of dust (photo).
While using this for a little bit, it got hot and noticed the battery is draining faster than normal. It also gotten hotter while charging on the back portion; battery area. The fan is also not very quite. Camera is from bottom up; like facing your nose from the bottom.
I really wanted to keep the XPS even tho it’s $100 something more than the latitude because of its modern and stylish look but I also wanted to have something durable for remote work few days a week which latitude are known for. So sadly I have to return this one. Someday maybe if I have to buy a new one, I’d probably buy this model.",
"Navy vet who is going to grad school at UNLV here. I absolutely LOVE the 8th gen Intel XPS laptop/notebook. The laptop might look small but it packs quite a punch. It comes with an 8th gen intel core I5 processor, 8 GB of ram and 128 gigs. It is very light weight and that is good because carrying that around campus in the summers, when it is over 110 degrees can be challenging. If you fly all the time you will appreciate this laptop because it is easy to carry. I love the infinity edge, the retna display on the camera and the battery life. What I don't love is the keyboard, it is a bit mushy and with Dell, upgrades are expensive like apple. I was going to get it from amazon but Dell offered a lower price, with my military discount. I was able to get this when it came out for $900 out the door. I highly recommend this notebook I am not a play video games on my laptop guy but you can use it for that, of course there are better laptops if that is what you want. This is perfect for the student or businessperson who wants a professional looking laptop. I also picked the silver color because it looks nice. People often mistake this laptop for a macbook pro but it's a Dell.",
"Got one when it first hit Amazon around 2 months ago. Terrific deal and it indeed does include a HD touchscreen. The SSD is a bit small but I always upgrade the SSDs anyway on these laptops to the fastest ones on the market. Mine was shipped in two days with free shipping to Hawaii. So far no problems with it and it indeed is brand new with a 14-month warrantee from Dell.

Beware as a lot of deals on Ebay are actually refurbs for around the same price. Also a lot of the sales and promos direct from Dell you need to check the fine print as many of the 8th Gen XPS laptops do not include a touchscreen.

That being said, due to the small 13"" screen size for best use of the touchscreen you need a stylus not unless you have real small fingers. In the same vein, getting the QHD screen in touchscreen is a waste of time and not worth the extra bucks.

Update: Downgraded to 3 stars because I finally got around to running CrystalMark 6.0 on this machine, only to find out that at 500/500 R/W speeds, the vendor installed a SATA III drive, not an NVME PCIE drive, which comes pretty much standard on computers sold in 2018. The ad here on Amazon is carefully worded to state only ""SSD"", with no indication it is the faster and more commonly used NVME drives, that is why I am giving it 3 stars for deception. I am currently in the process of upgrading to a 1 TB NVME PCIE drive, which I got for $270 (they normally run close to $400 but prices are continuing to drop).",
"So far so good!  I've heard of iBuyPower but never researched them as I usually build my own computers.  But the price of parts put the rig I wanted out of my budget this time 'round.  As I researched box rigs, the iBuyPower name popped up several times,

I finally found the Tracer MR at BestBuy of all places and I couldn't believe the set up for the price!  Reviews good, price good, build good - so I pulled the trigger.  Setup was pretty easy and this thing is QUIET for all the fans it's running.

At this point my only complaint is the RGB synching software.  The version that shipped caused antivirus to block and stop it.  I downloaded the latest version and only have control of the external fans and RAM.  All in all though, I don't care much about RGB and will most likely just shut it all off.

This is a very solidly built rig.  Packed right, decent setup instructions, and it fired right up.  I am a fan and have high hopes for th next couple years!",
"Track pad stopped working after only six months of non-daily use.

I bought this as my carry-around computer because it is small & light. Wanted to have the minimum amount of accessories. Unfortunately, since the trackpad died, I'm going to have to get a mouse.

Also, the fingerprint ID feature is really unreliable. If it doesn't work the first time, forget additional attempts, they don't work either. Then, instead of asking for your PASSWORD, the notebook asks you for your PIN. You aren't given the option of password or pin. IOW the security features on this device are a hassle. The touch ID is unreliable & the lack of options on answering an alternate security feature that you have actually memorized kind of blow with a computer that is your primary carry-around device. If I'm taking the computer out of the house, I want security features enabled. I want them to work like they are supposed to & not obstruct ME, the owner, from getting onto the device.",
"Returning this piece of junk after less than an hour out of the box. It looked shiny and new, but Amazon's refurbishment ""experts"" clearly have no expertise whatsoever. The PC was running incredibly slowly (far worse than the one I was trying to replace, which is suuuuper old), froze every time I tried to download software (all I attempted was Firefox and AVG Antivirus, I didn't get any farther than that). I had to do a hard shutdown with the power button after each download in order to access the installation file in my ""downloads"" folder because of the system freeze, and then the machine would freeze again if I tried to run the installation - these little installation wizards normally fire right up and take all of two minutes to complete. When I tried aborting the frozen process via the task manager, the PC would go totally blank (screen turns white, nothing on it, and again have no option but to shut down with the power button and then try again). I did six hard shutdowns in half an hour, trying to install the most basic functionality software. The 10 year old refurbed Lenovo I bought in a parking lot from a guy on Craigslist a year and a half ago works vastly better. The power cable that came with this machine (which, by the way, is super short, which might be an issue for a lot of people even buying the same computer new from the manufacturer) was in a crumpled mess in the box, so it doesn't seem like they're really trying to even create the appearance of professionalism. All Amazon's ""renewal"" program did was tie up $650 of my money for a while (I'll get the refund sometime after they receive the returned machine, supposedly...). I definitely won't be buying any product that Amazon is involved in making or refurbishing again, and when I get my money back, I'll just buy a brand new machine with less impressive specs for the same price - discounted pricing for better specs is useless if the machine doesn't actually work.",
"I recently got myself this tablet and I must say, it has exceeded all my expectations! The sleek design and vibrant display make it a pleasure to use. The processing power is impressive, allowing for smooth multitasking and lag-free performance. The battery life is phenomenal, lasting me through long hours of use without needing a charge. The user interface is intuitive and easy to navigate, making it perfect for both tech-savvy individuals and beginners. The wide range of apps available on the Android platform truly enhances my tablet experience, from productivity tools to entertainment options. The camera quality is fantastic, capturing my precious moments with clarity and vividness. The expandable storage option is a game-changer, providing ample space for all my files, photos, and videos. The sound quality is impressive, delivering crisp and immersive audio for my favorite movies and music. Overall, this Android tablet has become my go-to device for work, entertainment, and everything in between. I highly recommend it to anyone in search of a reliable and feature-packed tablet!",
"I received this laptop for work and was expecting it to be fast given the processor speed and the 4GB of RAM.  So far, I have been disappointed in the speed of this machine.  I find that it freezes when I just have one Excel spreadsheet open.  This happened to me on multiple occassions since I received the laptop, but not all the time.  It seems that it freezes randomly.

I would normally suspect something new with the machine that is causing the problem, since I upgraded from a lesser machine recently.  For example, maybe it's Windows 7 Professsional or Office 2007.  This is not the case since I had the exact same operating system and applications on my previous laptop.

On a positive note, I really like the integrated mouse features, as you can customize them however you like.  Some of the great features are: ability to zoom using gestures similar to Apple's iPhone, fast scrolling, button customization, and more.",
"I mostly use my tablet for playing puzzle or card games at night before going to bed. So it sits on my nightstand waiting to be used in the evening.  The other time I use it is for traveling on a plane to watch downloaded movies. I keep it in a padded case when not in use. I bought this Flying Tech tablet 6 months ago to replace my older Samsung. It worked well enough for the games.  I had a pattern lock on the device.  I took the tablet on a trip in August, used it on one leg of the trip, then when returning I pulled the tablet out, and the pattern lock would not unlock. I didn't forget the pattern and it had been in the case.  Now I have tried many times to unlock but am unable.  All info on the web says I need to factory reset.  So I have followed all the directions and get to the reboot screen but there is not an option to factory reset. The last time I tried I got a screen full of chinese characters so I just shut down the tablet.  Now I don't know what to do with it.  What a waste of money.  I just wanted a simple device to place games and movies on.",
"I like this laptop very much. It's sleek, small, fast and comfortable to use. It looks and feels sturdier than previously owned laptops and that is what you would expect from a Thinkpad seres. I bought the 8gb RAM and 256 SSD and so far it is just blazing fast and adqueate for most office tasks. I will soon put it to heavy test (statistical modelling and data/text mining) so I will see how that goes. I have one small but potentially annoying problem. Built-in mic stopped working a few days ago. Not sure what happened really as the mic appears to be installed but I tried with dozens of drivers and I have given up. I have read some people have had audio/mic issues with this laptop. Not sure if it is software of hardware problem, though. Most likely won't be sending it back since it's international shipping but just be aware that this may be an issue. Nothing that a good set of headphones cannot solve. Other than that, I am pretty confident this is the best laptop I have ever owned.",
"So when I was looking for a decent gaming laptop, I made an unprecedented turn to Lenovo.  I've never bought from them before, but with the deal (it was on sale) and the configuration, and honestly the reputation in the professional world, I decided to give them a try.

The good:  It is a 2019 era laptop, it (to me) was bought when they were starting to ship the 20 series nVidia gfx, literally if I waited 3 months, they were out..  That being said, the mobile 1660Ti is an amazing card and the i79750H packs a punch.  I mean, until you get to the bad part of this, the system ""IS"" really good.  Not too heavy, not too light (it is a performance laptop...) and a good screen on the LCD.  A real win.  Until.......

The bad:  Exactly 2 months after warranty expired (1 year warranty), one of the fans started making noise, then within days of infrequent use, stopped.  I tracked down the part number for the fan to replace it (helpful and useful info available on the Lenovo site, yea!!).  They use this company called encompass for all their official parts sales (this is the BIGGEST PROBLEM).  The part was ordered, and long story short, took over 6 months (ordered in October, received part in april, no joke).  This ONLY happened after I called Lenovo after several contact attempts with Encompass, who at one point CANCELED my order, only to then jack the price of the heatsink/fan combo (more on that later) from 58 to 89 dollars.  After complaining to Lenovo that they canceled my order and jacked the price up, my original ticket was reopened at the original price.  Still took 1.5 months (6 weeks) for a part to show up.  When it did, IT WAS USED!!  Had old thermal paste on it, but at that point I just didn't care, I used it as I was desperate to use my gaming laptop.  Mid April I installed my 'new to me, pad for new, got a used part' heatsink/fan.  3 weeks ago (so 2.5 months) IT DIED AGAIN.
I contacted encompass and did get an RMA, which I sent my bad unit back to them, at which they would send me a ""new"" replacement.  Guess what..  Shipping date ALREADY moved back 2 times, and now is saying the same thing it said the first time, ""NO ETA - FACTORY BACKORDER"".  I bet actual Lenovo tech's have no problem getting the part..  But I digress..  So two funny sidenotes about this.  1.  Encompass current price for the originall 58, then 89 dollar unit?  $160 bucks.  BOY has that thing gone up in price.  Funny bit #2?  The fan they use is actually a VERY common fan.  It is used on MANY HP, DELL, ACER and ASUS (if not more) laptops.  The difference is that Lenovo uses some form of plastic injection molding/melting process so the heatsink and fan are ONE assembly, whereas most other manufacturers use screws so at least if the fans fails, a tech or customer can easily remove the fan(s) alone and not have to replace the fans AND heatsink assembly.  To Lenovo's credit, it does seem at least one other version of the Y series laptop does in fact use removable fans, but I'm unable to tell if it was before or after this design.
It is simply for this reason I absolutely cannot recommend this product.  I shouldn't have to complain to Lenovo about their official parts supplier.  I shouldn't have to endlessly wait for 6 months once, and who knows how many more months for the next one to ship, based on my previous experience with them, this still practically new laptop is going to be useless by the time I get to actually use it again.  And will I have to call Lenovo AGAIN to actually make a part show up?  IDK, but it's not worth the hassle, and has absolutely left me scarred from making another Lenovo purchase.
The sad thing is, I work in a tech field, and our company uses hundreds of Lenovo laptops.  Their on-site repair team is top notch.  Their systems (they aren't GAMING units, business/enterprise class) run amazingly well.  (And yes, their tech's confirmed to me back in like December when I was in the middle of waiting the last time, THEY have that part, there's no shortage of ANY part to them).
The takeaway is if you are going to buy one of these, I would definitely buy an extended warranty through lenovo.  When it worked, I loved it, but since I've owned it, it's sat apart waiting on a fan more than I've gotten to use it.  Ugh.",
"We now have two of the Samsung Galaxy Tab 4.  These are a good size (8"") tablets.  I like the 16gb memory plus we added another 64gb with a micro sd card.  If you are considering purchasing a Samsung Galaxy tablet and are considering saving money by buying the 8gb instead and getting the large micro sd card, Don't Do It!!  The problem is all apps have to have a small amount of storage on your device regardless if you store the app on the sd card.  We have never had a problem running out of space with the 16gb SamSung Galaxy. We also have a third Samsung Galaxy 8gb, but we can't down load all the apps we should because of the issue I mentioned above.  I really like this Samsung Galaxy Tablet 4.  It is a really great Tablet.  The only issue you may find is that there are not many tablet cases designs to choose from due to the 8"" size. However, that does not reflect the great performance on this device.  I recommend the Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 SM-T330.",
"The IDEARACE Intel i5 CPU comes with a power adapter, mini WiFi antennas, a HDMI cable and some SATA cables.

The Wifi connection is also quite decent with the dual antennas.

Just like all the new PCs I received, I ran the PCmark benchmark on this unit right away which has a score of 1988. This about the same performance of a lower end 2018 Microsoft Surface Pro i5 laptop. Not a bad score but it is definitely not for high speed applications neither. The entire mini PC's case is made of good quality metal with heat sink type shapes all around for better heat dissipation. The unit does feel warm  but not burning hot neither when I laid my hand on the unit.

Overall, this mini PC is a good candidate as a general purpose desktop replacement. With the abundant amount of serial ports, it can be easily configured to control external hardware with additional programming.  It does not come with a user manual so some good experience with PC setup would be helpful.",
"First thing I would have to say about this mini PC is a fairly small computer. You cannot really install any additional attachment such as a low profile graphic card or another computer processor that is a bit stronger. You can however upgrade the ram and hard drive space if needed but you need to ensure that you get the appropriate ram and hard drive.  From what I can tell, it only has one slot for a single ram (standard 8 gb). This does run on older ram which is DDR3 (little disappointing). The hard drive it uses looks like an mSata drive and not an M2 drive which makes it a bit harder to upgrade as msata is not exactly new. Regardless of this, the system runs pretty well for just a mini PC. It does come with six serial ports, four x USB 3.0, four x USB 2.0 (why not make them all 3.0?), and two audio connectors. There is also two wifi antennas on the back that will pop out and you will need to ensure those do not get bent or broken as they are hard to replace. It comes with 8 gb of DDR3 ram which can be upgraded but I am unsure up to how much. It will be at least 16 gb but I do not have anything higher than a 16 gb for single stick to test that theory. There are only two HDMI ports to use for video output so you can actually run a multi screen build with this device. I did try it out and it ran okay. It was able to do your basic tasks while also watching a 4K movie on the other screen. There is no display port or DVI port which is a bit of a bummer. That being said you will get decent video quality using the HDMI port.  Upon opening it up, I saw that there is no fan in this and it does not run too hot. It runs pretty warm even when I push the computer. I found that to be a fairly decent design. It is a whole metal design so it is able to distribute the heat well throughout the computer. You are unable to install a 3.5 or 2.5 drive into this as there is no power or data connectors in this device. Although you can use this a media center computer, it works best with network and servers as you can plug in your network devices via serial ports on the back. You can easily access this device from afar when needed. There is no internal built in speakers so I would recommend if you are using this as a desktop to get a monitor with built in speakers to keep clutter down to a minimal. The device does feel a bit sluggish with the drive it is running on. There is built in wifi for 2.4 or 5 ghz. I would say it has enough USB to support the mouse, keyboard, and several ther things (most likely printer or webcam) if you want more then you will need to get an adapter. The mini PC is not too heavy as it is passively cooled. Can it run games? You basic games like minecraft can be run on it but it is not exactly meant for heavy gaming. I did try your basic games and it actually got really warm but nothing too dangerous to the PC. I also played multiple videos on there from my TV and it worked fine. It does come with windows 10 installed already so you do not have to purchase your own copy. There is bloatware that are installed on this really slows start up and I had to get rid of those. Overall I think this is a good size for a mini PC but I do feel like it does get throttled in performance due to not wanting to over heat the system. I also feel like it should have all USB 3.0 ports at this point. If you are looking for a PC that is really quiet and for your basic every day use than this will work. Just know that it does run on some older technology and you will be unable to make any real big upgrades to it.",
"Know what you are buying.

This specific notebook has emmc HD storage 32gb, What does this mean?  It means there's no removable HD. It is physically soldered onto the motherboard. You can not upgrade the HD, no sata port at all.  With that being said this also comes with 4gb of ram, you can upgrade it your self to 8gb at a cost of around 30.00 this will help with speed.

It comes with Windows 10, the sysem will  upgrade itself eventually on you.  When this happens it will download a large file.  At the end of  this you will be left with about 4gb of free storage.  When you upgrade windows will create a file on your C drive called windows.old it is roughly 8gb, Thats the ""old"" version of windows 10.  Windows will automatically delete that file with in 10 days, or you can manually delete it. This will leave you with 11/12gb of storage for other applications, etc.

If you just want to surf the internet, random zoom meetings and check email. This could be for you.  Otherwise look for something more capable.",
"I love the physical size of this computer.  But it can't handle Windows 10 and shouldn't be sold with Windows 10.

I bought it for travel, for weekends at my beach place, and a backup for when speaking.  I only need it for some light word processing, responding to email if it takes too much typing for a phone, and maybe projecting powerpoint if there were a compatibility problem with the host's computer.

The lag caused by Windows 10 in only 4 GB of RAM is tolerable for such light usage.  But 29 GB of storage is too little for Windows 10.  It leaves only about 6 GB for files and is too small for Windows to download updates.

Solution was simple and free. (a donation is appreciated)  Replace Windows with Linux.  I used the Mint flavor [distro] with the smallest version, xfce.  In some ways I like LibreOffice better than Microsoft Office.  Firefox is better than Edge.  As a bonus, your computer should be safer.

So I only gave four stars because I had to take the time to change the operating system.",
"I had to buy and return three previous laptops to finally get this one and it is great. I always said I would not buy a renewed laptop because I did not want someone else's problem. But after buying three other laptops and not getting the speed, quality and ease of use that I needed, I was becoming very disillusioned with my purchases. I could not believe that I could not find a laptop on Amazon. The speed and graphics of this Newest HP 15.6inch Lightweight Laptop, Intel Quad-Core i5-1035G1 Processor Up to 3.60 GHz, 8GB DDR4 RAM, 256GB SSD + 16GB Optane, HDMI, Bluetooth are amazing and I do not mind the small ding on the frame because it delivers what you would expect from a new laptop. I think it was more the fact that this seller truly understand that they can offer a quality product and still make a profit. When I first ordered this laptop, I thought I should have gotten a bigger discount because of its ""renewed"" status, but now I think I got a great deal because of speed and quality. This laptop is a so much better than what I was expecting after the three previous ""new"" duds I purchased. Please try this seller, BuyTek if you are looking for a renewed laptop.",
"I owned the bigger one and now own this one. Reading the reviews are simply ridiculous. You have one reviewer giving it 3 stars because he didn't get the right license-which has absolutely nothing to do with the function of the laptop and then you have the other one reviewer who has forgotten it is a 12.5 inch screen laptop-So I will add my 2 cents on actual use.
1. First of all-It is considered an ""ultra book"" or small laptop-That is the FIRST thing you have to remember..
2. It is has ALL the high end features you find in larger laptops (14-15.6) in a 12.5 screen.
3. The screen is nice and crisp however the colors are a hit or miss...depending on what you are watching (seems that way even with TVs hence the various video options but remember..this is a small laptop)
4. Touchpad....its a touchpad-unless you have Hellboy hands-its just fine for normal people.
5. Speakers are just fine for a small room but then again-gotta slap yourself and remind yourself...its a laptop and a small one at that but it does have a speaker output for headphones.
6. Mic-It works as well as any other laptop. Using Audacity has proved 100% success.
7. CPU-Aww gee..I gotta remember...this is a laptop and a small one...but the i5/i7 cpus are perfect, especially with 16gb of ram and a 1tb SSD/NVME-its fast however I am not going to be making movies or anything major because if I was...I would get a bigger screened laptop..duh!
8. KB is just fine and its lit up.
9. Wireless-Just as good as other laptops but with 5g capability AND a sim card input for broadband on the go.
10. Portability-Woah...now we got to the meat section. Its light...its thin and its easy to carry
11. Battery life...woaaahh no more negative nancy here...10-12 hours on one charge..Now all that petty complaining turns out to be...pointless
12. Applications-Runs multiple apps at one time-no sweat. Very fast wake up from sleep and reboots are seconds..
13. The chassis-Strong and durable. made of magnesium and feels solid.
14. The touch screen..yes...it comes with a touch screen.

So folks...these are low in price now. Which is why I waited...its well worth it if you get one now-it was worth it back then..but before you call yourself an expert...make sure you are buying it for what you need.",
"I didn't want to spend a lot of money on a Laptop. I'm a Mobile Tech, so my gear takes a beating. I shopped all weekend and settled on buying a new Unit from a Big Box Store, but come Monday the sale was over and the price went up $250.. Doh!

There are loads of Refurbished Laptops for sale everywhere and I was skeptical for sure. But the price was right and I took a chance. My Unit was advertised as in Excellent Condition and it was... Not a scratch on it.
The only thing that gives it away as a used piece are the slight witness marks on the Palm Rests where you lay you hands. So it must have been used in a business application by someone that typed a lot but took good care of it.

The Processor and Ram specs are great and rated as Battleship on PC UserBenchmark! The new Unit I was looking at was not this powerful and more expensive even on sale. This Unit is 3 years old at most going by the Processor manufacturer date. I have 4 Desktops in service and this Laptop is faster than all of them, LOL! The onboard Video Card is fine for HD Video but not intended demanding Games which is fine because that's not what I bought it for..

I've used it 2 days at work now and the Battery lasted all day where I was recharging my old Dual Core Unit by mid day.. I took the opportunity to do the free upgraded to Windows 11 and it's nice so far. This Unit was $1200 new so $400 was a GREAT DEAL! The 90 day return is good piece of mind.",
"I received the Samsung Tab Monday afternoon. It was defective right out of the box. While I was setting up the tablet it started going black every few seconds. I thought it was because it was not fully charged. I went a head and set it up. I then turned it off and fully charged it. I started to use it again and if I stopped for any reason it would go black and I would have to hit the power button to get the screen again. I tired to work with it and just gave up. This morning (Tuesday) I went on line to chat with the Samsung Support. I installed the program that allowed the tech to access my tablet.
He checked it out and recommend I set it back to factory re stall. I did and then I could not even work to set it up again as it kept going black.
The Samsung tech said it was most likely a factory defect and I could take it to a Samsung repair shop to have it fixed for free. That is not acceptable for me to have to repair a brand new tablet. So I am sending it back. I am not sure if I will purchase another Samsung Tablet A
or go with another brand. I will have to think about it for a while. I liked the size and look of the tablet, it just would not stay on long enough for me to use it.",
"My second try with an Android device, and my experience is a little better but not great. I'm constantly bumping the screen or causing the screen to pop a series choices I don't want, I can barely get through an article I want to read. Play You-tube videos is frustrating since I inevitable hit a different video half way through and there's no back button on the terrible YouTube app. On the positive side  the screen is very nice with great detail it is useful for reading emails and responding. In general I still think Android is the problem, it still feels like a cheap imitation to IOS, I don't like the behavior of the home screen or how I have to select apps, I don't like having to root the device to get rid of Chrome which I neither need or want and considering the space used by native pre-installed apps I was hoping that I'd have more control with Android. I originally bought the device to read magazines, and this it does very well using Google News stand app. Would I recommend this device, no save you money and get an iPad like I will end up doing or just get a cheap Android tablet, Android isn't worth spending a lot of money on. I was really hopeful that I'd love this device, I'd seen it in person and I'd liked the hardware, but I see I will just sell it and by an iPad.",
"First, this thing is so slippery I had to cover it with masking tape just to keep it from slipping around like a slimy fish. And where ever the screen is touched, some function turns on or off.  Trying to read a book on it is almost impossible unless you are comatose and can't move or breathe. You find your place and when you touch the device to set it down somewhere, it suddenly magnifies/decreases the page, turns on or off, goes ahead/behind to another chapter/page. Pick it up to correct it and it slips through your fingers like a wet fish.  After you have climbed out of bed to catch it again and find your place, and maybe even set the timer, then you have to place the weanie speakers right up to your ears because if you are the kind of person who likes to breathe, you won't be able to hear it because the volume is on the back of the unitand is very very weak.  So you can't see what you're doing plus HEAR anything at the same time.  Forget about listening to this thing in the car on the way to your knitting class.  Also, every time you turn on the wi fi to say, download a book, prepare to wait about 15 minutes and to lose about 98% of your battery before you can actually use it again.  When all updates are finally finished you only have 2% battery and have to recharge before listening to your audio book or checking your email. In the middle of doing anything it freezes up because suddenly you have 17 mysterious gigabytes trying to run at one time.  It is nothing at all like the more substantial Tab 2.  Its a fail :(",
"Decent tablet for the price, nothing too fancy by any means, but has a good display, super light weight and it's a nice iPad Mini like size.

I would recommend anyone in this price range either spend a little more or find a used iPad Mini instead. This isn't a BAD tablet, but it's a $199 tablet at best. Over all it's fine for web browsing and reading books but not good for anything more than that. It struggles with anything graphic intensive. Even just loading webpages and apps it's not very fast. Just slow performance from something that's brand new for 2015..

It's a tablet, it does tablet things. It looks nice, it's lightweight. If you like the Samsung ecosystem you're good to go there. I wish the menu / back buttons on the bottom were illuminated like they are on the Samsung phones..

My last issue is there is a lack of accessories. Just a bunch of ""folio"" type cases.. I'd prefer something more rugged. But that's a result of the tablet being so new.. so not really a fault of the tablet.

It's okay. Not too impressed. Just a tablet by Samsung.",
"I've had the Tab A for about a month--have been using it with an OMOTON smart case, an Anker Bluetooth keyboard, and an iKross collapsible stand.  I love it. Very portable and convenient-it does what I want (mainly email, internet, writing).  More inviting than a full-size laptop and easy to use anywhere (the car, the kitchen table, etc.), which makes it easier to get past writers block  (I can use my smartphone as a Wi-Fi hotspot for internet connectivity if need be). The 8"" is just the right size for me--screen is big enough to read web pages comfortably but still very portable . No complaints about the screen resolution (I don't watch video on it or play games).  Bluetooth connectivity works well (occasional, rare, connection blips).  Long-lasting charge.  Got helpful free phone support from Samsung. [Note:  The advertised free Word and other MS Office applications are extremely limited--not worth downloading.]",
"It's an okay tablet.  The newer android version means you can't do things with an SD card that you used to be able to.  The fact that there's pre-installed MS apps:  If you need them, great.  If like me you don't need them?  You can force stop/disable, but there is no way to uninstall them.  that means there's apps taking up a lot of room when added together.  Have just a few apps I d/l, nothing fancy or super huge.  But since you can't move apps, etc. to an SD card (bought with - don't even know if it works!) you're looking at using up a good chunk of the 16Gb this tablet comes with.

Screen is nice and clear, easy to hold, fast enough.  The camera (I know, tablet cameras usually aren't super) is terrible imho and I'm talking about the back camera.  Also do not like where the back camera is.  It's just not serving the purpose I bought it for at all.  Very disappointed with Samsung and this tablet.  I don't buy things often and when I do, I don't buy something to be completely frustrated by it.  Will be returning and guess for now I'll just stay with my Samsung Tab Pro 8.4 even though it's far behind the current android version.  It's not like I'm doing anything sensitive on it.",
"I was looking for a tablet or reader for travel. After doing a bunch of comparisons, it came down to the Amazon Paperwhite, Kindle HD 8"", or the Samsung Tab A 8.0 (I really wanted the Samsung S2 or S3, but couldn't justify the cost). The Paperwhite screen was only 6"", which was too small for me. So, the Kindle vs Tab A. I finally decided that I didn't want to lock myself into the Amazon ecosystem, so I chose the Tab A.

So far, I'm loving it. Perfect size for reading (about the size of a hardback book, definitely bigger than a paperback). I downloaded the Netflix app. Yes, I prefer a bigger screen, but it's perfect for an occasional flight in a cramped seat. My MP3 files sound great, and all of my reading apps run flawlessly. The only wart is that the Tab A 8.0 only has one speaker, so the only way to get stereo sound is via external speakers or ear buds. No biggie, since I bought this for its portability.

All in all  I couldn't be happier.",
"I absolutely love this tablet! I mainly use it to check social media and read ebooks, and I find it to be a perfect size for reading. The design is sleek, thin, and the smoky titanium is aesthetically pleasing. I know I can take this with me anywhere, and the battery life is solid. So far I've been able to get two days of use on a single charge.

Performance wise, this tablet is very fast and responsive. It's basically a bigger version of my galaxy phone, which I love. The storage space is a little small, but thankfully there's an sd slot to make up for that. The only weird thing I've run into is it had me go through 3 or 4 software updates when I first got it, so it could upgrade to the latest version of android. For me this wasn't a problem, just a little annoying to deal with upon first using it. For the price this is a very high quality product, and I would recommend it to anyone!

Pros: lightweight, beautiful display, very responsive touchscreen, good battery life, google apps, sleek look, fast performance
Cons: small storage space of only 16gb",
"So far, for the price, I'm loving it. It's a gift for my 5 year old son because his Tab 3 Kids Edition is going to his younger sister. So far, I've installed all his favorite apps (even ones he ran out of room for on his old tablet), and I've got room for more. I added a 64GB microSD card, and told Google Play to load all movies on the card (AWESOME!!!! Saves soooo much space). I've also got VUDU installed doing the same... in total, I've added about 10 HD movies to his tablet all without taking up space from the precious 16GB RAM. [if you're wondering, the movies from Google Play are mainly Disney Movies Anywhere digital copies, and VUDU has the remaining UltraViolet digital copies).  All of them look fantastic on his tab (really, the relatively low screen resolution is NOT a problem whatsoever, for him and for most adults). He's not going to be looking and working with tiny fonts where he'll notice the tiny jaggies.
Now I just need a bit more time to see how its performance holds up with his games and general usage, and how sturdy it is in his case.",
"I bought this tablet to replace an older Acer tablet. The product is well built. I particularly like the 4:3 format for viewing Web pages. I seldom watch videos on a tablet so that was also a factor in selecting the 4:3 format and the lower resolution of the Tab A vs the higher end Samsung tablets. The touch screen has a nice feel and is very responsive. I also like the magnetic sensor that places the tablet in sleep mode when using a case that has this feature. I have used 7 inch tablets and find them too small. Trying 10 inch tablets in stores I have found them to be a bit cumbersome and heavy for casual use and travel. The 8 inch size of this tablet is perfect for our use. It is near us at all times for quick Web browsing and reading email. The tablet comes with Microsoft Office, but I rarely use it on the tablet. I find that these programs are much better on a desktop or laptop computer. All in all this tablet is perfect for our needs and I would recommend it anybody looking for a tablet they are using it for casual browsing and reading email.",
"I've had this tablet four days and I've been experiencing a lot of issues with it. First of all the screen was a huge turn off when I just received it and took my eyes a few days to get accustomed to it. Secondly the performance is very poor! Apps crashes and freezes a lot and the device itself is very slow. I bought a 128gb SD card and my memory is still full...…i have to constantly delete apps or reload to the memory card. I am very disappointed because I've read mostly positive reviews about this tablet. This is also my second tablet after having to return the first one after only 2 days. Samsung needs to do a software update fast!

Update: I've  now had this tablet almost 2 weeks and the performance has improve a lot since my first post. I changed the interface  from touchwiz to something else and it made a world of difference. I am now really enjoying everything about my tablet.....and as of now I have no regrets. I've fallen in love with this tablet.",
"4 YEARS LATER... I have decided to upgrade to a new tab. This tab never died. It simply lived its full life.
First the display is not gonna compare to the flagship devices. You can see the pixels if you're looking for them. The audio quality is passable at best. The cameras also are passable.

Ok. Once I accepted those ""cons"" it performs fine under my standards. The UI is virtually identical to the high dollar units. It has ran without issue any Play Store app I've tried. I'm not a mobile gamer so I'm not sure on that. The device quality as far as material is good. Feels the same as the flagship. Looks clean and elegant. Has the micro SD slot! I don't feel left behind by the higher devices. This device suits my needs. I watch Netflix, YT, and any vid I try. Use Google calendar, message apps, social media, pay bills etc... My eyes adjusted to the screen so I don't notice the flaws and it's plenty bright. Bottom line: I saved $200+ and sacrificed very little. Im off the ""flagship"" bandwagon. Keeping up with the Joneses isn't worth it.",
"So far, so good, although I have added a Rhino guard because I am clumsy and now it barely fits in the Amazon Basics sleeve I originally ordered with it. If you tend to armor your electronics as I do you might want to shop around for something just a bit larger, but that's the Basics case, not the Tablet. Android 5 autocorrect is very aggressive and not very smart, so be careful if you're in email or on Spacebook before you've finished a cup of coffee. I had returned a Kit Kat tablet because I need to space on my external SD. Win. I actually travelled to Europe with a tablet and Bluetooth keyboard for a month's study, and so far this one is holding up very well as my portable word processor as well. Last, watched a movie with my girlfriend using the keyboard stand (before the Rhino case came). Very sharp picture without viewing angle issues, and exceptional sound, and less than 30% battery depletion for a two hour film on Netflix. I haven't watched anything since putting it in the Rhino, and I hope that doesn't disrupt the excellence of the volume and clarity of the sound. Overall, if you need or want a smaller tablet, are generally happy with the Samsung brand (as I am), this is the tablet for you.",
"It's OK runs well so far, it's still new so time will tell as these products seem to deteriorate over time. It is somewhat fast thus far and handles all apps pretty well. One issue I am running to a lot is Apps in the google store give me the error 'may not be optimized for this device"" about 80% of the time. Seems rather odd. Supposed to be with Android 5 but was delivered with Android 6. Upon starting is immediately began an update and now it is running Android 7.1.1. Perhaps that might be the issue with the apps. it also is confused about the ""home page"" because ALL apps I install say it is ""adding short cut to the home page"" but actually it is adding it to the page just to the right of the home page, and YES, I know where my home page is. Screen is very clear and it reads books really well with ZERO pixelation. I am finding it is much easier to use it in landscape mode but I am constantly clicking back button and multiple page button over and over again. It's also very easy the click the apps on the bottom row by accident as well......I am for ever opening up the camera by accident. I hate the position of the rear camera...when in landscape and trying to take a picture my fingers always get in the way of the lense due to its poor placement. Si I have to hold it by the very edge so as not to block the lense and that makes it a bit difficult to hold it steady and secure. Pictures are OK for the price I paid but the camera does not do well in poor or low lighting. I also am finding that the touch screen is somewhat sporadic. Some times while online it takes multiple taps in order for it to register. I don't know how many camera shots I have lost due to the fact that it wasn't registering my taps on the button. My biggest downer about this thus far is the speaker placement. In portrait it is on the bottom left and in landscape it is on the bottom right, right where my hand is. Super poor placement IMO. Overall, for the price I paid for it I am somewhat happy but I just have to get used to the things I don't like about it.",
"Had this now for about a week. My previous tablet was a ipad gen 4 which has a 10"" screen.
Bare in mind this is the mid grade tablet from Samsung. And you won't be disappointed; this product suits my needs but only just.
The screen clarity leaves a little to be desired for. And the speed is bare minimum for my Internet browsing and mild game playing. I understand this could be in part due to Internet speeds but is a bit slow on noninternet based applications as well.
But going from 10"" screen to 8"" has been pretty painless for me. My old Ipad usually got left behind at home or in the car when out and about due to size and weight.

Pros:
  Weight and size make the travel and Daly use friends
  Does everything I need it to do
  Battery life is quite good
  I feel the 8"" screen size is perfect to accomplish most everything
Cons:
  A little slow
  Medium quality graphics or screen quality

I'm not a super tech guy so excuse me If I used the wrong terminology above.",
"Works great!Specially satisfied with the new android update.It's good for gaming experience but not all games work perfectly.Some lag a bit but other than that it's good for the ones on the middle range and it's a good time killer for those who need one.The battery is pretty good.It lasts at least a day with full charge of gaming with taking breaks.I calculated about 5 percent for half an hour of playing..but of course it also depends on the game itself.The battery charges for 'bout 4 to 5 hours which isn't all that great but for this price and the quality you're getting i believe it's worth the buck.
I'm very satisfied with the display.Very bright and pronoun colors.I was in a dilemma between this and the Tab E 9'6 but when i watched a comparison video i got infatuated.Put on something colorful on that lock screen and watch the magic.
Only negative i can say is that i received the wrong power brick.We don't use the same kind in most of Europe.

P.S I forgot to mention that the sound speaker is in a pretty bad place.Like when you use the accelometer in racing games i keep blocking it with my hand.Not an issue if you put on a pair headphones though.",
"After a week of usage I love this little tablet. I have been using iPads since they were initially released and have had a few. This one blows them right out of the water. The battery life is amazing. I fully charged the device when I got it and ran it through some tests. Streaming video from Netflix for 8 consecutive hours took the battery from 100% to 72% Side by side with my 4th generation iPad doing the same test the battery on the iPad drained to 15%. Yes, I'm sure the battery being new has something to do with it. but impressive nonetheless.

I setup the kids mode and allow my 4 year old son to play with it. He loves it and the kids mode allows him to play without any worry of accidental purchases, or getting into something he shouldn't.

Also the added free software they include is quite nice. The full MS Office suite comes pre-loaded which is surprisingly nice to have. I deal with a lot of Spreadsheets for work and it has allowed me to keep my laptop in my bag and handle things from the tablet.

I expanded the memory with a 128 GB micro SD. For the same amount of storage with the iPad it would cost more then buying 3 of these.

All that being said, The screen is not as sharp as I would like. But if that's not a big deal to you this thing is a winner.

I feel confident in making a recommendation for this product, and plan on buying one for my parents and siblings this Christmas.",
"Before I begin you should know we have only had this for a day so far. BUT I LOVE IT!

This was actually bought for my son (I use it also). We originally bought a kids Amazon fire and that was a huge disappointment. I didn't want to pay the amount of money they asked for an iPad so I asked multiple people and did tons of research and everything pointed to this tablet!

It took me a little while to figure out since I have never owned any Samsung products, but I'm talking 10 minutes at most. It's still set up very similarly to Apple products.

This tablet runs great, super fast, which was the main problem with the fire. This one also offers everything I was looking for.
Most parents want the ""kids time"" stuff with apps for their kids, which I believe there is an app for that on here, but I didn't. I wanted to download netflix, kids YouTube, learning apps, Disney jr, etc. That way my son could choose between what he wanted to do easily. The apps that came on here like chrome and mail and such I just moved 4 pages over and he has no idea they are there! I have my apps over there also ;)
The other great thing about this tablet is the battery life! It doesn't take long to charge and the battery actually lasts!

I'm extremely impressed with this tablet, it is definitely worth the money!
I 100% recommend this for a child or adult!",
"Being a technophobe (a lady of a certain age without a smart phone), I bought this tablet to keep up with e-mail while on a three-week trip on which I didn't want to haul my laptop.  I couldn't possibly have set up the tablet myself, and in fact, it took my very savvy computer guru several hours to set it up and to teach me how to do basic things on it.  So I suppose I would have to say that it isn't ideal for the novice or the faint of heart.  But I'm sure that once I have a chance to practice and experiment with it, I will grow to be less cautious and terrified of it.  There is much to be liked about it, but the one thing I find both frustrating and annoying is that in writing e-mails, it anticipates the words being typed and as often as not gets them wrong, but types them anyhow, necessitating constant retyping and attentive re-reading of one's messages before clicking ""send.""  I would have preferred spell-check to this anticipatory feature, which rather than speeding up the composition of a message, actually slows it down considerably.  I've not yet experimented with the tablet's many capabilities and features, including the camera, which I have been told is excellent.  I also have not added any apps.  So this review must be considered somewhat premature and a work-in-progress.",
"I just purchased this tablet, and I am in love!!! I did a lot of research on tablets, and I was looking for one that had the ability to transfer apps to the SD card. There were many that said they could, but when I did further research, they actually could not, so don’t be fooled. The screen size on this tablet was 8”, and I am used to using a 7” screen, but I am now a HUGE fan of the 8” screen this one has. The processer was 1.5 GB ram, and it runs so fast and smooth. I got a 16 GB and added a 16 GB SD card, and I have tons of room. We also have a nexus 7 tablet, and I was looking for something comparable to that, and this one did, and exceeded my expectations. The nexus 7 does not allow an SD card, so this is an upgrade from that tablet for sure.  Also, I am huge into the online game apps, and I have installed 13 of my game apps on it, in addition to many other apps within the first week, with no problems at all. I have so much room on it, it is amazing. I have read many reviews that say the screen quality on this particular tablet was not good, and I have found that to be false in my opinion. This tablet came with the home charger, which was something some other tablets I reviewed did not all come with. I would recommend this tablet to anyone looking for a fast, high capacity tablet that is not so expensive that you have to mortgage your house to own one.",
"Easy to navigate.  Good response time.  Received new on 12/31/2017 with 60% charge - user manual advises that charging should be done before first use.  Time to charge was about as user manual explains - 4 hours to charge if fully discharged.  So, it took about 1 hour 35 minutes.  Easy to set up - not too many screens to go through and not difficult to figure out how to provide input to go on to next screens.  User manual misled me by its description of Microsoft Word being preloaded on the tablet.  After copying a Word document from a computer to this tablet, the document could not be opened - interface sought a network connection.  I thought that I would be able to at least view a Word document without a network connection.  Samsung customer service person informed me that at least for first use, tablet software will seek updates to Word, and therefore a network connection is needed.  After initial updates, I was informed that I should be able to work with Word documents without a network connection.  Found out 1/1/2018 that Ethernet network option is not available despite the user manual describing that it is.  Samsung customer service informed me that the Galaxy Tab A is not designed to work on an Ethernet network no matter what adapter is tried.  Internet search, that included discussions among tablet users did not find any assurances of tablet use with any Ethernet adapters.,",
"About a year ago I bought a Samsung Galaxy 7 tablet for my son as a Christmas gift, but never had a lot of interest in buying one for myself, seeing I owned a Kindle Fire.  Even though he is disabled, my son loves his tablet and takes it most everywhere with him.  I have a Samsung Galaxy 5 cell phone, but it is a work phone and I am not allowed to load apps or anything to it.  Love the phone but not being able to do anything non-work related with it is frustrating.  So between my son's tablet and my phone, I have always been impressed with Samsung mobile type products.  A friend has a Samsung tablet and suggested I might find it easier to use and more beneficial than my Kindle.  I had always found the Kindle to be difficult to use except as a reader and for audible books and I have had it for several years now.  So I figured I would give a tablet a try and this Samsung seemed to fit the bill.  I am very impressed with it and now do everything I use to do with the Kindle plus a lot more.  Accessing email, using apps, shopping on Amazon, plus syncing it with my Kindle and Audible books, is a lot better than my Kindle.  So the Kindle will gather dust or I will give it to a friend.  BTW - I don't get the cheap looking comments on this tablet.  Not so in my opinion and I have a nice case for it, so not sure what folks are referring to in that regard.  Very nice tablet for this first time tablet owner.",
"This tablet arrived today so it is a little early for a full review, but I will review anyway.  I was looking for a lightweight, fast, and reliable Android table for under $300. This one definitely exceeds my expectations (and at a great price). My husband has a new ipad (not air) that I think its too bulky. Also, I don't love iOS and am not a fan of itunes.  So Apple was out for me.  I was worried Samsung would add too many layers on top of the pure Android experience, but Lollipop (it upgraded already!) seems to have minimal overt Samsung modifications (at least none that bother me).

I am not a heavy video consumer but the few videos I did watch (you tube) looked great to me.
Strongly recommend this table at this price point!

Update:
I've had it for a few days and still love a lot about it.  What I don't love: even though I don't watch a lot of video content, the resolution difference between this tablet and my phone is enormous.  I didn't think it would matter to me -- but it does.  I like reading websites on my phone better, which defeats one of the purposes of this tablet. Also, the touch screen isn't always as responsive as I'm used to.  I haven't seen anyone else mention this in the Tab A, so maybe it is just this device. I also get a lag sometimes that I never get on my Moto X (phone).  I'm leaning toward returning it right now even though I still think it is a great tablet otherwise.  Changed from 5 to 4 stars.",
Got this tablet as a Christmas gift.  Have had iPads & phones for a number of years so hard to rate an android like I do apple.  I do like the tablet and can do pretty much what our apples do.  The main thing I may be unhappy with is not being able to move some of the apps to the SD card.  I don't go app crazy so I only have a few apps but I'm disappointed that some won't move to the external SD card and it seems like the 16 GB memory is filling up fast.  Haven't checked user guide to see if there are more options to free up space once the internal storage is full but could be I can uninstall a lot of pre-loaded apps that I won't use. Galaxy has a great reputation and I do like the chance to learn about android since my wife has an android tablet.  Because it's not like iOS it takes a while to accomplish what we want but so far have muddled my way through things.  I have also heard because android is a user based OS that it is easier to hack. Also read that sometimes moving apps or some things from 1 android OS to another may not work.  The tablet seems to run slower than apples and at times it seems like it locks up.  I'm  sure if you're an android fan the tablet would rate 5 stars.  I gave it 4 because the cost of the android is more reasonable than apple.  Hope this is helpful.,
"I got this as a gift when my old Tab 3 died on me, and I'm happy that I did. The larger sized screen on this one (8 as opposed to my old one being 7) makes typing a lot easier. The screen is also very crisp and clear and I have no problem with the resolution as other reviewers complained about.

Pros:
Beautiful, clear screen

The colors on everything are nice

Apps load and run quickly and play perfectly

The speeds of things (for the most part, see my 'cons' list) are really fast

The split screen feature seems nice, but I only used it once and I don't need it really

The tablet itself is pretty lightweight and comfortable

The rear camera is REALLY nice, the auto-focus is great, and it takes very clear nice photos in the daytime. Nighttime photos varies depending on the amount of lighting

Cons:
Browser & Youtube speeds - I find that Chrome crawls and loads pages slowly, even mobile versions. Often I wait quite a long time for something to load on a page, or the youtube app will show the spinning wheel for quite some time. I didn't have this issue with the older Tab 3 with browsing, but I did with Youtube so perhaps it's an issue with Youtube's app? Either way, browser speeds were sluggish.

Fingerprints show up BIG TIME on the glass. The first time I used it and put it down I could see every detail of where my fingers had been.

The front facing camera is awful in every lighting. I found myself trying to awkwardly take pictures with the back camera instead of the front because the front one is just bad. I'm also really not feeling the facial beauty thing it does on self photos and I haven't found a way to turn it off yet. It also doesn't appear to have the auto focus the rear camera does.",
"I have been an Apple iPad purist for years. When I recently gave my mother my iPad Mini (she is having some issues with her vision and it's easier for her to use for certain apps than her phone), I thought I'd be content with just having my Pro 9.7. However, I like to read in bed, and the larger iPad really doesn't work well for that. I considered a Kindle Paperwhite, but since the Paperwhite doesn't reverse to a black field with white text I didn't want to use that and needed something for which I could use the Kindle app.

I decided to try an Android tablet, which would be significantly less expensive than a new Mini 4. Plus, I'd been wanting to get experience with Android because I have friends who have Android phones who are always asking me questions about them for which I have no answer. After doing a bit of research, I decided on the Galaxy Tab A 8-inch, which was almost exactly the same size as the Mini. Several local stores had good sales but nobody ... and I mean NOBODY ... had one in stock. They had plenty of the 7"" tablets but with the smaller size and only 8GB of memory, even with the SD expansion slot, I wasn't interested. So I ordered it here.

I am very pleased with this device. It was easy to set up and it's been responsive and intuitive to use. The size and form factor are nearly identical to my old Mini. If anything I like the Kindle app better on the Android than on the iPad -- not the least of which is because you can buy Kindle books directly from the Android app and not from the Apple one (has to do with Apple demanding 30% of all sales on the iPad, which includes Kindle books. Can't say I blame Amazon for not wanting part of that ""deal"").

I only have one minor complaint and not a large enough one to warrant a loss of a star -- you can't turn down the ambient light on the Galaxy as far as you can with the Mini. This only becomes an issue because I tend to stay up later than my husband so when I am reading he is trying to sleep, and it seems like I can't get the screen as dark as my Mini could go. Curiously, he says the ambient light it throws seems to be less overall and it doesn't bother him at all. Maybe it projects less overall but it seems brighter to me.",
"Update 4/2/2016: BUYER BEWARE: While I am still happy with this tablet, I purchased this as an Open Box item from Amazon's Warehouse. I have purchased other products from them, was really happy at the ""deals"" I got, and got them covered with an extended warranty through Square Trade. It occurred to me I hadn't covered this tablet and tried to do so. After jumping through a ton of hoops, I was informed Amazon changed its policy and no longer offers Square Trade warranties for Amazon Warehouse. The other two warranty suggestions I received got so many horrible reviews from users, I wondered why these were even available at Amazon.

To add insult to injury, I purchased a lovely case to protect this beautiful tablet, set it down on the window sill and it slipped off and cracked ... in the case! Ugh! Thank goodness I bought it with my American Express card, which protects purchases (including drops) in the first 90days. That said, please keep in mind that Amazon will NOT help you with quality warranties on Warehouse merchandise AND, not for nothing, but I'm a little unhappy that the tablet is so ""fragile"" (?) that the screen cracks so easily, and very unhappy that the cover offered such little protection. I am very careful with my things & often have them for YEARS, so I am a bit disappointed in the fragility of this product.

Original review: I am very happy with the Samsung tablet. I have watched more than  a few on demand videos now and don't understand the criticism of picture/screen quality - it's beautiful. I have the 8"" Tab A and couldn't be happier with my decision. I charged it fully when I got it on Sunday (!); today is Friday and I am only now charging it again. Mind you, the battery was at about 46%. Incredibly decent. And during that time, I watched about 3 hours of video content, checked email daily and left WiFi on. My cover puts the tablet to sleep when closed and wakes it up when opened, so it has not been shut down in six days. I have access to all the apps I could need and LOVE that it comes loaded with Microsoft Office - giving me access to Word, Excel  and Power Point.  I don't know how well the camera and video work yet but will update if something is amis. I had this on my Wish list and kept an eye for a deal. I spotted one in the Amazon Warehouse, listed in very good condition for $151.00 vs. $195.00. I would say it is BRAND new and cannot imagine email you could see a difference! Outstanding. The tablet was still in the cellophane with plugs and cords. Very pleased and would definitely recommend AND buy again.",
"First, many thanks to Amazon! Outstanding service, as always!
Samsung Galaxy Tab A 8"" Tablet. I purchased it because my 4"" Galaxy Player has a very old version of Android: 2.3.5. Therefore some of my beloved applications start disappearing because their creators upgraded them for a higher Android version. So sad. My little player was and still is the best hardware there is with all the bells and whistles that many of the new tablets can't match today.
So, my experience with Samsung's tablet:
8"" is too big for my little hands. Holding it to read a book or the news with one hand is a pain. Try both hands, and you'll find your fingers on the screen, which, normally will make the tablet to respond to some commands and switch the screens, open up other apps...and so forth. And I have the continuous sensation that the tablet wants to slip an fall all the time.
Another annoying feature is the screen brightness. Yes, I did try to set it up from Auto On/Off. In the dark, at night, it darkens. In the daylight, brightens. Very strange way of acting and totally stubborn despite the settings. Missing a + and - for manually adjusting it. (Because in the top front of screen there is a sensor that watches you and adjust the brightness of the screen based on if thinks you are looking at it or not? how maddening is that? The tablet knows better what you need? How hard is to push a + or a -  /setting ????
The most annoying issue is on how the Marshmallow, 6.0 is distorting the resolution on some applications. Didn't they learned that when upgrading to a new OS version, the video capacity of the computers(tablets) is to be considered?
All my beloved puzzle games are not plastered on an 8"" screen, they look like a tank rolled over them, if you ever booted your Windows OS in Safe Mode, you know what I see here.
The tablet came with the Lollypop, but once you unpack it, set it up and connect it online, it automatically updates, upgrades and so on.
So, in 5 minutes from connecting I had the Marshmallow, 6.01. (btw, fabulous fast connectivity and speed from my unlocked T-Mobile WiFi hotspot device).
I am sick and tired being used by Microsoft over the years of being an unpaid - but - paying tester of their OS. It seems that Google is now doing the same.
However, looking at it, the tablet is very attractive, and I won't contest most buyers here are satisfied. And congratulations to all! Overall, it is a good buy. Samsung and Amazon are both in my heart.
But based on my personal inability to handle the device (hands too small) I have to return it, and I am really sorry.
If anyone returns it, please don't forget: Delete the Google account you created in the tablet (not your gmail account!), then reset it to the factory settings before returning it. Because that's the nice thing to do.",
"The missing stars are 1) on one side for the bloatware Samsung packs on this tablet. I don't care about or can download myself if I want to: Skype, Netflix, Word, Excel, PowerPoint and some more. Why is it most manufacturers believe this will help? I would be better to let the owner decide. 2) Anothe other reason I took a star away is Lollipop 5.02... Really..? On 2016...? Lollipop (Android 5 was released on 2014). Yes, I know Samsung promised Lollipop for the Tab A... but when...? 2018..? This is now a ONE YEAR OLD tablet, that came with an ALREADY OLD ANDROID VERSION and STILL HAS NO UPDATE TO MARSHMALLOW, so I've stopped dreaming about ""N"". Next tablet will be a Nexus. No doubt about it!

Felt good to let that out of my system. Now, on the good side, the 4:3 format is just great, and the 8 inches is like the perfect size. I come from a Tab 2 7.0 oldie and I prefer tablets I can hold on one hand. For the record: I use the tablet for study during the day and some reading on the bed.

Finally, the original Samsung clamp is also great. It holds to the Tab A with a special lock the Tab has, and looks nice! It has a reasonbale price.",
"Works great! for about a 100$ it does what I needed it to and is the perfect size to fit in my purse. So far Ive owned 3/4 different tablets: a small ""phablet"", this one (8""), a 10"" nexus, and the surface pro 4. Of the 4 tablets, I like this size the best.  The phablet I found was too big and awkward to comfortably fit in my pockets, but small enough that reading books or watching tv was a bit uncomfortable on the eyes.  By contrast the 10"" nexus and surface pro 4 (which I use for work primarily) are to large to fit in my mid size purses.  This size can fit in nearly every one of my bags ( the only exception being my small clutches and evening bags).

 It works quickly, and I havent had any issues with it overheating. It is a bit of a slow charger, and if your are using the tablet with the screen on full brightness, it will drain the battery faster then it will charge. I did find however, that so long as you have the brightness set to the lowest level, it will (slowly) charge at a rate of about 1% increase per 10 minutes.  In normal conditions, if I am not charging and using simultaneously, it takes a couple hours to fully charge.

The blue smoke color is beautiful.  I bought a cheap (like 6$) case for my tablet to protect since it does get tossed about in my purse.",
"The resolution specs & some of the reviews kept me from buying this initially...and so I went chasing pixels and bought the new Tab A 7.0 as a Mother's Day present for my wife to replace her Tab 3 7.0. Skipping to the punch line, the 7.0 went back to Amazon the next day and I got the Tab A 8.0 the day after that. My wife loves it. Resolution? Pixels? Processor? Android Version? My wife couldn't care less. The 4:3 display is bright and colorful & the tablet is fast.

Would I have bought it for myself? No. I bought the 8.0 Tab S2 6 months ago because I buy the best electronics products I can afford regardless of the price/performance ratios. This is no knock on the S2...I would make the same decision again today. The 320 ppi AMOLED display is gorgeous and it is fast...but really no faster than the A 8.0 for the way my wife uses her tablet. Why? The S2 needs the Quad Core processors and the higher performance GPU to push everything out on to that beautiful screen. The processor on the Tab A has a lot less work to do and it does it remarkably well...especially for a $169 tablet. Can I tell the difference when I put this tablet and my S2 side by side? You bet...but in this case that was quite beside the point.

So consider the user's needs and/or check the tablet out yourself before dismissing it because of the specs.",
"SAMSUNG GALAXY TAB A 8-INCH TABLET

I am very late getting into the world of tablets and such, but for Mother's Day my husband purchased this tablet for me.  I love playing the game WORDS WITH FRIENDS.  I was playing through my computer, through FACEBOOK.  The game moved so slowly, pop-up commercials were a constant, the board would freeze, and all of this would cut into my game production time.  Plus, it was very frustrating to sit and wait while a letter slowly went from the bottom of the board to where I wanted to place it!  And, really, I have ZERO patience!

My husband got me this SAMSUNG tablet and I could not be happier with it.  I am able to be on FACEBOOK, play WORDS WITH FRIENDS, check my email, play other games, plus there are many other features that I have yet to dive into.  The tablet fits nicely in my hands.  It also comes with a stylus. There is also a charger included  The tablet charges quickly and holds the charge for my entire day.  We purchased a screen protector and cover separately for my tablet.  It is sleek and cool and wonderful.

I am a technology challenged person, but seem to be able to muddle through this tablet and its many functions nicely.  I can honestly highly recommend this unit to you.  Me?  I LOVE mine!",
"I own both the models of Galaxy Tab A 9.7 and 8.0  in our household and the Tab A 8.0 is the one I use personally all them time mainly because of its compact size which is great for one handed use and a sharper screen . I purchased the Tab A 8.0 after deliberating considerably whether to go for the Tab A 8.0 or the newer Tab E . In the end I choose the Tab A because if felt much more premium in hands compared to the Tab E.  Here's how I feel these both the Tab A 9.7 & 8.0  tablets stack up against each other if you're considering either of the two :

BUILD QUALITY
- Both the  tablets are made of plastic with a metallic frame that runs around its sides. Despite its plastic construction these tablets do not feel cheap in any way ( The newer Tab E in comparison feels cheaper) with its soft touch matte finish plastic
- The color choices on the tablet is great , having owned both the White & 'Smoky Titanium' colors - you cant go wrong with either of them . The white color is a nice soft metallic white with a slight pearl effect and the 'Smoky Titanium' is more of a metallic gunmetal shade - a good departure of the standard solid whites ,greys or blacks found on most other tablets

FEATURES & PERFORMANCE
- Both the Tab A 8.0 & 9.7 feature the same Qualcomm SnapDragon 410 processor - A mid range quad core 64 Bit 1.2 Ghz processor released in 2014
- Both the 8.0"" and 9.7"" scored pretty similarly on the AnTuTu synthetic benchmark owing to their similar hardware specifications (see pics)
- Both 9.7"" and 8.0"" tablets feature screens with 768 X 1024 resolution which gives them a pixel density ( higher values mean sharper images & text) of 160 PPI for the 8.0"" model and 132 PPI on the 9.7"" model
- The 160 PPI pixel density on the 8.0"" is adequate for most uses , including browsing text heavy websites like Wikipedia , without having to zoom in too much. The pixelation is much more noticeable on the 9.7"" model
- The screen colors are rich and vibrant with good viewing angles
- The 8.0"" tab features a 4200 mAh battery which is good for 1.5 days of heavy use , the only issue here is it charges rather slowly at max of 1A as compared to the max charging current of 2A on the 9."" model
- In terms of performance , it can easily handle about 3 simultaneous tabs in the chrome browser after which the limitations & slowdowns due to its 1.5GB RAM become apparent (Both models have 1.5GB RAM)
- The single speaker at the bottom of the 8.0"" model is pretty weak and you would usually have to turn up the volume above 75% to hear anything clearly (as opposed to better dual stereo speakers on the 9.7"" model)
- The tablet does have an expandable MircoSD card slot which is great

THE GOOD
- The 8.0 model has a rich and vibrant screen with good viewing angles and sufficient resolution for everyday use
- Touchscreen sensitivity and fluidity is great with not stuttery UI performance
- The 8.0 screen size is ideal for one handed use , yet offer enough real estate for media consumption like pictures or videos.
- The tablet performance is more than adequate, I had no issues running 1080P movies on the Netflix app , browsing with 3-4 tabs open or playing light games like Temple Run, Subway Surfer etc
- I absolutely love Samsung's implementation of  multi-tasking which allows you to run two compatible apps side by side in windowed form . This is one feature , which once you get used to, you will be using very often
- Expandable storage
- Its upgraded to the latest Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow OS

THE NOT SO GOOD
- Weak single speaker
- the 5MP rear and 2MP front camera's are not that great, though they are sufficient for video chatting
- Average battery life of 1.5 days and very slow charging speeds at 1A
- For these reasons I take away one star

FINAL THOUGHTS
Overall I really like the Tab A 8.0 (over our Tab A 9.7) and can highly recommend it to you as you get a great form factor , decent screen resolution and performance with bright vivid colors and expandable storage all for under a $150 price tag. In fact i still choose this tablet over heavily discounted Ipad Mini during Black Friday 2016 as I felt it fulfilled my requirements sufficiently and gave more bang for my buck",
"I have been using this tablet pretty heavily since I got it about 4 months ago. I am a college student as well as an entrepreneur, and I use this device for school work, working on my online store, and for some apps and games that are just entertainment. pro's and con's below:

Pros:
- The major selling point for me was microsoft office. To be able to use word and excel while away from my house without my lugging around my laptop is a pretty big deal for me. I got a keyboard case to go with it of course, but that isn't relevant to this review

-It is fast, I can run multiple apps all day long with no problems at all. searching the web, making documents, playing games are all flawlessly quick.

-Battery life, Did I mention I use this all day? No problems with the battery so far. I just make sure I charge it every night and there are no problems all day long. on the off chance I do forget I plug it in while I am doing something else and it charges reasonably quickly.

-Look and feel. This is a pretty decently built device. It doesn't look or feel cheap. Also the size (8 inch) is perfect.

-Screen clarity and resolution. The screen resolution is the one complaint I have seen on here, but I honestly don't know why. It looks good, and for all of the things I use it for, it is perfect. Sure this isn't an ultra high definition screen, but so what? To each their own I suppose.

Con's

-If I think of any, or anything changes I will edit this review. As of now, literally no complaints.",
"Picked up this tablet recently when the price dipped one evening to about $130 for use as a FPV and telemetry display for flying my Solo quads.  I had been using my Samsung phone, but I wanted a bigger image to help compensate for slightly over 30 eyes.  The 8"" size is perfect, although a tad heavy and about the max that fits in the controller mount.  I had initially tried an older 8"" Lenovo tablet that I already had, but it was incompatible with the app I need to run.  The Tab A is one of the tablets tested to be fully compatible with the app, so I figured I'd just buy one, especially given the price, even though the technology is getting a little dated.  Interestingly, when I'm not out flying, I find myself using this tablet more and more for email, reading the news over coffee in the morning (not CNN or MSNBC fake news!), web searches, Amazon shopping, etc.  It's plenty fast enough for these purposes, the display is sufficiently bright and pleasant to look at, and the battery holds up well for many hours.  It also comes with very usable Microsoft Office apps, although I've so far only found the need to use Word or Excel a couple of times.  The only negative as a FPV display is that the image could be a tad brighter for outdoor use.  But with a sun shade or by standing under a tree to get out of the direct sun, it works pretty well to see where you're flying and to keep track of down-range distance, altitude, flight battery charge state, etc.  For the price paid, this is a really nice tablet in a size that's perfect for me.  Oh yeah, one nice surprise I wasn't expecting: shortly after I started using it, the operating system updated to Android 7!",
"Tl;dr Acer Predator Triton 500 (PT516-52S-73YD) has quality control issues.  Heat dissipation from the GPU goes through the w,a,s,d keys on the keyboard making for VERY uncomfortable gaming unless you use an external keyboard.  GPU started glitching after a week of use.  Acer warranty support technicians couldn’t fix it after 3 attempts and 6 weeks of back-and-forth with their repair center.  The technicians damaged the laptop during the repairs.  Acer Corporate Support tried to replace it with an inferior machine (Acer Nitro 5 with lower specs), which I refused, and Acer has so far refused to issue a refund.

Full story:

My Acer Predator Triton 500 (PT516-52S-73YD) worked well for about a week.  The keyboard, especially under the w,a,s,d keys, would become uncomfortably hot while playing games.  It seemed all the heat from the GPU was dissipating through some of the most popular keys used in gaming keyboard configurations.  This seems a questionable design choice for a gaming laptop.

After about a week, games started to distort, especially in games that utilized fading, video playback, or parallax effects.  Horizontal lines and visual artifacts began appearing during game rendering.  It even affected games with less demanding requirements (e.g. Terraria) and demanding but less visually intense games (e.g. XCOM: Enemy Unknown). The problem became progressively worse over time, and eventually became so bad that games were unplayable.

I sent the laptop back to Acer for repair.  They sent it back unfixed (they just updated the drivers and re-installed the OS, which I had already tried myself).  Immediately sent it back, telling them it was likely a problem with the GPU and explaining exact instructions on how to reproduce the issue. They sent it back unfixed (they replaced the mainboard this time).  Immediately sent it back a third time, this time including a video showing exactly how to reproduce the issue.  They sent it back unfixed (they replaced the mainboard again and the LCD display, damaging my laptop lid in the process).  This whole process took 6 weeks.

I called support, they said all I could do is send it back again.  They said there was no way to escalate the issue or otherwise complain.  I just had to put up with their process.

I ended up calling the Acer corporate number.  I was eventually connected with a “Corporate Customer Support” rep.  That rep tried to offer me a new laptop, a Nitro 5, and tried to pass it off as an upgrade because it had a 2TB hard drive and more memory.  Sure, a bigger hard-drive, but the memory was DDR 4 vs DDR5 and the Nitro 5 they offered had a significantly smaller display resolution and slower refresh rate compared to the Acer Predator Triton 500 I originally purchased.  Plus, the Nitro 5 has a cheaper construction quality (more plastic on the chassis; heavier components; thicker, less portable body; etc).  I declined their offer and asked for them to commit to sending me an exact replacement for the model I purchased (Predator Triton 500).  All I wanted was a commitment that they’d do this, but said they could not make this commitment in a timely fashion, so I requested a full refund.

As of the time of this writing, it’s been a week since I requested the refund, and, despite multiple calls to corporate customer support, they have so far refused to commit to issuing a refund.  I’ve filled out the forms they requested and have provided the proof of purchase they requested.  To be clear, I understand it takes a while for an actual refund to be issued.  All I’m looking for is a commitment that they WILL issue a refund, which they still refuse to give.  The rep I’m working with says that it’s in “the finance department's hands”, and that I have to wait for them to make a decision on whether or not my machine qualifies for a refund, which the rep says could take “weeks”.  When I asked if I could escalate the issue, the rep said no.

I have given Acer 7 weeks now to make this right and to stand behind the quality of their products.  They’ve so far refused to do so.  In the meantime, they are holding the money I spent on this laptop hostage while I’m left with a broken gaming laptop that does not play games.",
"Since there's no way to award stars in half-point increments, I would round up my rating for the Acer Chromebook 315 from 4.5 to 5. The advantages this model offers are plentiful (especially at this price point), and the functional issues are relatively few. Some of my personal gripes are unfortunately inherent in all Chromebooks, so it seems unfair to penalize a product for simply being what it is. Any cons I list will therefore be restricted to those that I consider deficiencies or limitations in comparison to other Chromebooks--and again, I didn't find many. Even the ones I did find, I wouldn't classify as insurmountable.

Display:

>The HD display seems to earn its name. Graphics are crisp and free of distortion, and the 15.6"" display makes even the tiniest icons visible for people with average-to-good eyesight. The display is very aesthetically pleasing overall.
>I don't personally fall into the ""average-to-good"" eyesight category, unfortunately. I've been extremely nearsighted for most of my life, and developing astigmatism in my teens and mild farsightedness around age 40 have done me zero favors. But I'm also not considered seriously visually impaired, so I don't necessarily expect to have difficulty adjusting my display to make my devices optimally functional. While the Acer 315's display settings can certainly be changed and are fairly straightforward to access, the default settings were so very small that it took me more time than it should have to navigate to the menu where I could adjust them. Even then I had to get uncomfortably close to the screen to make sure I was adjusting the correct ones. I realize this won't be a problem for most users, and I wouldn't remotely consider it a reason to avoid buying this particular product, but for people who fall into a similar ""gray area"" it could come as an unpleasant surprise. Some may even want to have help on hand during setup.

Speakers:

>Audio quality and options are probably not going to meet the standards of serious music enthusiasts or gamers, but sound quality is better than average, and will suit dedicated Chromebook users just fine. The upward-facing speakers help with projection as well. In fact, you can produce a surprising amount of volume with them, even on lower settings. I also didn't find that audio quality declined in any appreciable way as volume increased.

System/processing speed:

>Processing speed seems good, even quite fast at times.
> I've experienced a few unexplained crashes, although not many, and I was never able to determine whether it was truly an issue with hardware or due to a specific app or operating system error (or a need to update either). Most device users recognize that outdated software can be pretty buggy, and even up-to-date apps are notorious for having issues, so those seem far more likely culprits in occasional crashes. I wouldn't blame any type of hardware, including the Acer 315, without compelling evidence.

Battery life:

>Battery life has so far been excellent. Even under heavy use, a full charge can easily last 4-6 hours, if not more (I haven't ever pushed it to the limit). It also charges quickly and loses very little charge in sleep mode. I haven't timed it exactly, but I've left the Acer 315 in sleep mode with numerous tabs open for 3-4 days at a stretch, and have lost no more than 10% charge in that time. My regular (older) laptop, along with an older, inexpensive Acer Chromebook in my household will both drain to zero and power off if left sleeping for a comparable amount of time. Hopefully this performance won't decline with age.

Keyboard and touchpad:

>The keyboard layout is pretty standard for a Chromebook; the only real variation is in scale. The keys are comfortably large and appropriately responsive. They also seem to have a surface treatment that makes them slightly rough in texture, and thus resistant to oils and dirt. The coating does that job quite well, which is a point in its favor. However, I've found that if my light source hits the keyboard at just the wrong angle, it renders the labels on the keys all but invisible. This is more of a nuisance than anything, but sometimes changes in brightness or light angle are quite subtle, and it can be quite startling to look down after you've been intently focused on a project for some time and realize that you're momentarily unable to orient your fingers to your keys. Even a slight shift brings them right back into focus, but sometimes even slight positional shifts aren't easily obtained in certain environments. (I did verify this effect with other users in my household to be sure that it wasn't an artifact of my own subpar eyesight. It wasn't.)
>I didn't find the default settings for the touchpad to be intuitive. It was almost *too* responsive, but seemingly only in certain regions. This led to a very frustrating series of unintended exits from various apps, some of which caused me to lose work or progress. Since the options for adjusting the touchpad are quite limited compared to my laptop, it took numerous trial-and-error attempts for me to optimize its function. (And by ""optimize"" I mean that I no longer want to tear my hair out when I use it, not that it's been modified to my personal ideal.)

Design:

>The entire unit is sleek, lightweight, and highly portable. The keyboard and screen are easily twice the size of the older Chromebook model, but the Acer 315 has a slimmer profile and weighs about the same. In fact, the way its weight is distributed actually makes it feel much lighter. Even the charging cable, while a bit cumbersome, isn't especially difficult to fit in a standard 14-16"" Chromebook case and doesn't add much weight.

Overall, I would consider the Acer 315 a very good value. You can certainly find cheaper Chromebooks that will perform the same basic functions, but if you'd prefer one that looks and feels more like a traditional laptop (or one that offers a little more punch for people who enjoy gaming or music at a hobbyist level and would appreciate the ability to translate some of those activities to a Chromebook without a huge loss in experiential quality), the difference in price between the least expensive models and the Acer 315 is neither extreme nor out of proportion. The primary draw of Chromebooks in general has always been the functionality, mobility, and reduced expense offered by cloud-based systems. The Acer 315 seems to represent a sensible and appealing middle ground for people who find that those systems suit their needs well, but don't want or need to go completely bare-bones to get them.

I received this product in exchange for a fair and honest review.",
"This is my first chromebook, but I've had a bunch of laptop computers, and a couple tablets. This certainly fills a helpful niche for a lot of people. It's fast and responsive. Does all of the basic tasks you might want it to if you don't need to load special software onto a machine for anything specific. It's not small, at 15"", so it's not your lightest or most portable chromebook option, but it'll fit into most adult backpacks (how I usually carry my stuff) or laptop bags. The screen is decent, and sound is good (it can fill a small room with sound fairly well). It has a built-in MicroSD card reader that I really wish was a normal-sized SD card reader, which I find more useful. The ability to charge via a USB-C cable, from either side of the computer, is handy. I do also wish it had an HDMI port for easier connections to projectors and such. Pretty sure the USB-C port can output the signal if I had the right adapter, but I don't (yet?). Plenty of apps are available from the Play store. Though not certain ones I had hoped for, like my kindle app (Amazon and Google don't get along in Chromebook-land, I guess; I found a workaround in the Kindle cloud reader). Anyway, this is a cheap way to get a fast and useful internet-connected device that does a lot of things well.",
"Okay I'm giving this Acer Chromebook 5 stars! I'm basing this on everything the chromebook has to offer at it's price point. It's not going to be the most amazing chromebook out there, but it's under 300 dollars people!  One of the major pros to this chromebook is it's 15.6 inch screen. This is alot larger than most chromebooks that average about 11 to 14 inches.  It also offers 1080p which sounds great but stretched out across the 15.6 inch screen it does make some graphics and fonts a little bit  blurry. The product page on Amazon says Acer say the battery life lasts up ton10 hours, I'd say that definitely depends on what you're doing. Watching my daughter play on it, I'd say that it lasts at about 7 hours but that's mostly playing games. Another cool feature is the two upward facing speakers that flank both sides of the keyboard, and the touchpad is a rather larger size. This particular chromebook is not a touchscreen screen, but you are able to use the play store which isn pretty awesome being able to use some many apps. It has USB c ports and a headphone Jack port as well. It does come with a web cam, and the outside of the computer is a nice silver.  Overall based on the price point I think this is a great chromebook for kids!",
"I wasn't exactly sure what I was expecting since I've never had a laptop with a Chrome OS.  The thing that works for this laptop is that a student working in the cloud will love this - it opens fast, you can work with Office 365 or Google Docs - anything you can do online, this machine is up for the task.  It is not, however, a gaming computer at all unless it is a game you can play online.  The OS of this laptop does not require the RAM that Windows requires so it is an on/off fast laptop.  It is a large laptop which may be good or bad, depending on the person.  The keyboard isn't cramped at all, it has nice-sounding speakers and usb/earphone ports.  The best part is considering what laptops cost, getting this one is within reach of most students.  My daughter and I talked about the cost - I bought my HP laptop with Windows 10 a couple of years ago as a refurbished one at the local computer shop and it still cost me $600 - new, it still, today, is retailing for $1200!  For a tad over $200, you can grab this one and have pretty much everything you need.",
"This is my first chrome book, so it's taking a bit of getting used to, but it is quite simple to learn and use. This laptop has a bright clear screen and seems to have good battery life. I haven't used it much but so far it's been great for browsing the web, and using some of the supported apps. The key board is more spaced out then my work one so although likely better for some that are used to that (for example my wife's power book has similar key board spacing) it throughs me off some because I use my work laptop every day where as this one I use less often. One other thing about the keyboard is that it does have the Home and end keys. If you are a regular user of these keys like I am it can be a bit annoying. I haven't really put it through any major stress, but it seems powerful enough to proforma the tasks I'm using it for. I personally would probably buy a smaller screen chrome book next time, but nothing about the discription was miss leading, just a change in my preference. The items above I complained about are me being a bit nit picky, over all it's a great chrome book for it's intended use.",
"There are a lot of reasons to love this. For me the most practical uses are students, and also older folks who are used to the cell phone interface, and do not need any sort of sophisticated function. It is wonderful for basic web surfing using Google Chrome. I also use it with Photoshop and it works absolutely beautifully! I am getting used to the file sharing, and otherwise the setup. This is much more user friendly for those who are used to the app setup on a laptop then those of us who grew up on the Windows OS.

I do love that you can get whatever you need on the App store, there is so much cost free technology to dump on and use. The keyboard is wonderful, and silent. I love the screen size, and the clarity is pretty good, but not perfect. It isn't the ideal machine if you are looking for solid graphics and resolution. The speed of the machine is pretty good overall for what we use it for.

You do need a Google account to setup the machine. IF you have a Samsung phone, you already have one, or if you use a Google calendar, etc. Not hard, just another step (but cost free) if you don't have a Google account.

Basically this is a good student machine. I don't see a wide application outside of that, but it can be used for low use households looking for very basic functionality at a good price.",
"This Acer Chromebook 315 CB315-2H-455L was offered to me in my Amazon Vine selection.  I like Chromebooks and my family has owned at least one for the past few years.  I also like Acer products.  We own both Acer desk top computers and Acer Chromebooks.  We basically use the Chromebooks for internet browsing, social media and Netflix viewing.  Obviously, those things can be done on cell phones and smaller devices, but we prefer a larger screen.  This Acer Chromebook 315 is a very nice Chromebook.  It is a definite upgrade from the Acer Chromebook N3060 I purchased earlier this year.  (It also costs more.)  The first thing I noticed was how sleek looking it was; I love its brushed silver finish and its nice, large screen.  I also noticed that it powers up and operates quickly, has good resolution and has good speakers.  I thought it might have a backlit keyboard, but that is on the touch screen versions (CB315-2HT), which are a bit more expensive.  (There are currently 6 different versions of the Chromebook 315 on the Acer website.)  For those who have not used a Chromebook before, be aware that Chromebook does not utilize Microsoft Office; it runs on Chrome OS.  However, Chrome OS can edit, download, and convert the Microsoft Office files in Google Docs, Sheets and Slides.  In addition, a Chromebook does not have a CD/DVD drive, but an external drive can be attached.  Bottom line, we like this Chromebook:  It looks good and performs well.

That basically sums up my personal viewpoint.  However, this Chromebook offers a lot, more than the usual Chromebook, and the above paragraph doesn’t address all of that.  Here is some additional information taken from the Acer website:  “This impressive Acer Chromebook 315 is an ideal replacement for a desktop. Its large screen and upward facing speakers make it perfect for watching videos and video conferencing.  It is Acer’s first Chromebook powered by AMD A-Series Processors with Radeon Graphics.  The processors enable customers to stream video, run the latest apps, play web games and browse the Internet effortlessly.  It also supports millions of Android apps on Google Play for entertainment, productivity, connectivity and more.”

In conclusion, this Acer Chromebook 315 is an excellent Chromebook, more advanced than previous models.  It looks great and performs well.  We like this Chromebook and would recommend.  However, if someone is only going to use a Chromebook for internet browsing and video viewing, they could get by with a less expensive Chromebook, which Acer also sells.",
"I set up this Acer Chromebook 315 for my mother to use since she needs something simple. Because it doesn’t have a disk drive, it boots up very quickly and she really likes this feature. It is lightweight and small with a 15.6” screen. She also mostly uses it to surf the net and check email. This device is good for users that have only these basic needs. Be aware that you will be operating within the Google environment – Linux-based Chrome OS, Chrome browser, Gmail, etc. The Google OS will not recognize MPG video files, unfortunately. The device has 2 USB-C ports and 2 USB 3.0 ports. The worst negative feature is the screen resolution. There is no way it is high definition, the way the manufacturer states. The so-called “ComfyView” HD – 1366 x 768 provides a viewing experience that really strains my mom’s eyes. Beyond the crappy resolution, you have to look at the screen head-on to be able to read anything because the viewing angle is so narrow. I couldn’t figure out a way to permanently enlarge the text on the screen for her. This really would be a great device for seniors if it had decent screen resolution. I can’t even imagine trying to watch movies on this thing.",
"I'm not a computer expert and this review will be strictly from a layman's viewpoint. I had another Chrome Book a couple of years ago and it died on me within weeks (battery issues that I had to have repaired repeatedly) so I've been using this for a while to make sure it actually kept working (it has).

There's a slight learning curve if you're switching to a Chrome Book from a traditional laptop or desktop computer. This doesn't have nearly the same amount of pure function; yes, there are apps available through the Google Play store for just about anything but it still won't help this machine edit images and videos like a laptop or process documents like a Windows-based system. It's a basic computer for basic tasks like watching Netflix or Hulu (great screen resolution), surfing the internet and document processing via Google Docs.

As far as performance, it's good for what it is. There are a number of things I'm still having a difficult time with: the keyboard is smaller than usual and it takes me a bit each time to get my hands in the right place so I'm not typing gibberish; the touchpad is kind of a mess - sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't and the right-click has to be done with a great deal of finesse and two fingers pressed on a very specific (occasionally random) place on the pad. The entire thing freezes up on me sometimes and I generally don't do much beyond basic word processing, a little web surfing and organizing files.

For its price point, this is a fairly decent choice if you aren't married to the idea of a Windows laptop. I will always wish it had more function but the truth is, I don't do the same kinds of things on a computer that I used to (gaming, photo editing) and this will probably be more than enough.",
"First, this is not meant to be a laptop.  As a Chromebook, the primary function of this device is to work through the Google/Chrome interface to accomplish what you need to do.  As such, RAM needs are smaller than a laptop's (not running anything but a browser or Android apps) and the hard drive doesn't need to be that large (though if you want a lot of apps or a lot of media to watch or listen to offline, you will need a microSD card).  It also relies primarily on being connected to the Internet.  You can do things offline, but its strength is working online.  So, knowing what this is, and how it's intended to be used, it works as expected.

Because this is 15.6 inches, the keyboard is full size and is comfortable to use.  However, the lack of page up/page down keys or a delete key is a frustration for working in a document.  Because this is a Chromebook, though, you get some extra keys for working in the browser that are nice to have to make a mouse less necessary.  There are keys for back, forward, and refresh, as well as full screen and going back.  There are also volume up, volume down, and mute keys.  Again, working through a browser (or an Android interface, these are nice.  The screen is easy to read at its size, but like many reviewers say, it's not as sharp as you would expect.  It falls into that ""good enough"" category.  I work mostly with documents, so I'm not worried about my hi-def video experience.

It has two USB-C and two USB-A (the rectangular one we always put things in upside down in) 3.1 ports, so connecting peripherals is no problem.  The Chromebook also charges through either USB-C port.  There is also a microSD slot for that oh-so-necessary offline storage.  It worked just fine with a 256GB SanDisk microSD card I tried.  Battery life runs about 7 hours so far, though I know after discharging and recharging a few times it may go up a little.  Size and weight are very good.  It's less than an inch when closed, and though the specs say 6 pounds, it feels lighter than that.  Built-in webcam, microphone and speakers (which are surprisingly good) make this good for video chatting as well.

All told, this is very nice machine for performing the basics.  I experienced no lag on videos (from the drive and the microSD card), and the few apps I loaded were snappy.  I didn't do any gaming, but this should work pretty much like an Android tablet for that, so if it runs well on a tablet, it should run well here.  It's not a fully loaded laptop, but it's not meant to be, and for what it is, there are no complaints.  Older adults or school age children will find it more than adequate, and even other users will not be disappointed in having it do what it's meant for.",
"I won't get into Chromebook vs tablet vs laptop--- that's outside the scope of a product review, and I'm writing the review based on the assumption that you are definitely in the market for a Chromebook.

My bottom line is that the 315 is a good buy. It isn't perfect but for the price it offers a lot.

Features including several USB C ports, an A port, and a microSD slot, which is a good thing to augment the rather vanilla 32 GB internal storage. It comes with 4 GB of RAM, which is fine for nearly all Chromebook uses. The screen is just over 15 inches with HD resolution in 1920x1080 native. The built-in keyboard looks lost in the body of the unit, but it's full-size for the most part. Upward facing speakers run down each side of the keyboard. The touchpad is truly enormous.

The unit uses a dedicated charger though it appears you could charge it more slowly from a USB charger with less current capacity. You can charge through any of the USB C ports, which is very convenient.

Wifi is 802.11ac (and lower) dual band. Very fast, and it's today's standard.

Set-up is trivial. Connect to wifi, log in to your Google account, let the software update and that's it. You'll surely want to adjust the touchpad speed and some other things, but that's easy enough. There is an online manual (as usual these days, very little documentation comes in the box).

I had no objections to the display, although it seems not everyone likes it. I thought the colors were good and the resolution quite good enough. Yes, there are other devices with higher resolution. For most internet and media consumption, you'll do fine with this device. You aren't going to be editing 4k videos with it, but it never was sold for that.

Performance is fast and snappy. You can install Android apps very easily and most (not all) work as expected. There is also a Linux subsystem feature, which gives you even more options, but that isn't yet fully developed.

This unit doesn't have a touch screen. I consider that a feature rather than a lack. This isn't a tablet and the touchpad lets you do everything you want without having to lift your hand and poke at the screen.

The keyboard is okay. The tactile feel is good enough if nothing special. There are some compromises --- you have to fool with an auxiliary key to get function keys, the arrows are half size, there is no explicit page up/page down and many others are missing, but there are combination chords available for some of the missing things. Still, this is probably the weakest part of the ensemble. Given all the real estate available, this could and should have been done much better.

Bluetooth works as expected with no issues; just be aware that it's on by default. Turn it off to save a little on battery if not in use.

Battery life is easily 6 hours, depending on usage, and can be as much as 10. It's enough for a day's intermittent work or a longish flight (okay, not L.A. to Paris, but still).

The unit has a beautiful brushed aluminum finish (must be back in style again?). It is heavier and larger than I might like, but you can't get a 15.6 inch screen into a small case, either. Definitely buy a sleeve for this so the aluminum doesn't scratch.

As to build quality it seems quite sturdy and well made.

This is a very good deal on a Chromebook. There is a lot here for the price. It is not perfect, and I do take one star off for the keyboard and the weight. So four stars as my bottom line.",
"We got this laptop as an extra device to be shared among members of our household. The hope was that our school aged child could use the computer for school work and entertainment, and that the adults could use it for surfing the internet, streaming media, answering email, and doing some work related tasks and projects.

Pros:

It is light and sleek, with a hard durable case.
We have been able to watch movies and shows on Netflix, Hulu, YouTube, and Amazon Prime with no problems.
We use this computer in the kitchen to look up recipes.
This computer was great when we needed to watch a how-to Netflix video for a DIY appliance repair. It is better than continually consulting our smartphones.
We use this computer to stream podcasts and audio books. The sound is a little tinny, but decent quality.
This computer is fast to start and load webpages.
We use this computer to watch videos and shows when we are exercising at home.

Cons:

The touchpad and keyboard don't feel very intuitive. The touchpad feels more sluggish than others we have used. You  can hook a mouse up to the computer, which helps a bit.
For a fast typist, this is a frustrating keyboard to use. It slowed us down and we made more typos than usual. It is not a great computer to use to type out a long email, or update a google spreadsheet or work on your novel in a google doc.
The screen is pretty awful. Text on webpages looks small and a little fuzzy. I'm a 40-something adult and have to constantly zoom in to make the text bigger on every page and then I still feel like I'm squinting and getting a headache. Ideal for a kid doing a quick homework assignment. Not ideal for a far-sighted adult working on a writing project, reading long news articles, or answering more than a few emails.
Video quality is disappointing. It satisfies the child who wants to watch cartoons, but an adult trying to have a quality video watching experience is going to be disappointed.

Verdict:
You get what you pay for. For the cost, $300, this computer suits our basic home entertainment and web surfing needs. It is an easy computer for a child to use. If you are a college student or professional who needs a computer to do actual work on, this is not going to meet your needs",
"I hate using this Chromebook because even with just a few tabs open in Chrome, it LAGS.  I have another very similar chromebook that is much better (Acer 15.6in FHD(1920x1080) IPS Touchscreen Business Chromebook- Aluminum Metal Body, Intel Celeron N3350 Processor, 4GB LPDDR4 RAM, 32GB SSD, WiFi, Bluetooth, Chrome OS-(Renewed))  I don't know if it's because this one has an AMD processor and the other has an Intel, but this one was new and the other was refurbished and less expensive.  I can't even use Zoom with everything else closed, and it's NOT my internet service because everything else I have works fine.  It also feels cheaper than the other one i have - the body is very plastic feeling...well it is plastic so what else would I expect.  By the way, I never review things but I just dislike this chromebook so much!  Only buy it if you are desperate (as I was during the beginning of the Covid quarantine, so it was better than nothing), and if you only plan on having one chrome tab open at a time.",
"I bought this to replace a ten year old commercial workstation computer.  I wanted to build my own but did not want to pay the current market inflated prices for a video card.

After researching the brand (MSI) for its products (motherboards and video cards mainly), I compared this offerings against the open market (brick and mortar stores and online computer sellers) for turn-key systems from the main name brands and some of the boutique makers.  This unit was the best 'value' and price for what it actually offered (DDR5, 12th gen i7 CPU, RTX video card, and m2 SSD 3Gb/s hard drive, liquid cooling).

The box was well packed (no issues with damage in delivery) and everything worked at boot up time.

Its VERY fast - I installed benchmarking software (PassMark) and it scored in the 98%-tile overall.  Being a former hardware builder and tweaker, I fiddled with the overclocking software - very easy to use and had gained a modest bump.  Even in stock settings, it plays the newest games with all settings maxed out (at 2550x1440 resolution, 144hz) with a very high frame rate.  It supports 4k but I cannot afford a 4k monitor.....

I have been very impressed and would recommend.",
"I must say that the computer ran quite well for those two hours. It was fast and quiet. However, two hours in I got a ""Watchdog Violation,"" and the computer blue-screened. When it turned back on it would only load to BIOS and no longer recognized that the M2 drive was installed in the motherboard. Nothing I tried would get it to load to the boot drive. I contacted technical support and they told me to return it which I did. I have since ordered a new one directly from the manufacturer, because again, prior to the blue screen it worked fine. I give it one star here purely because I cannot excuse a 2-hour lifespan...hopefully if you decide to get it the computer it will live longer. If possible, I will update you with how the direct from the manufacturer version goes.

Edit:
After returning the one from Amazon, I ordered a new one directly from the manufacturer. The one from the manufacturer took a week to arrive, but so far (about 5 days in) it works great. It runs fast and cool. I updated the star rating from 1 to 4 stars because I expect a version even from Amazon to work just as well as one directly from the manufacturer. Although I have not run the highest spec games on it so far, however, I have run CPU intensive games usually do not get the CPU above 50 C and only has a CPU usage of about 40%. RAM is DDR5 and has run fine, most of the time only 50% of the 16GB is being used. The MSI center runs a little weird and seems like it is trying to base GPU numbers on the integrated graphics and not the 3070ti, but Nvidia can give you numbers on the GPU. Hopefully, this computer lasts a while, glad to know I got a year warranty from MSI.",
"I purchased this product sold by Amazon during the black Friday sale.

I usually build my own systems, but the price of this product on the black Friday sale was cheaper than I could build the equivalent system myself.

When I received this system, the rear ports are blocked by the I/O shield. Either the motherboard is warped, not mounted properly in the case, or the I/O shield is not stamped properly, and cables cannot be plugged into several of the rear ports.

I noticed that another Amazon customer had the same problem, and posted a photo before returning the system.

The photo posted to Amazon looked so much the same as mine, that I thought it might be possible that the defective system had been sent back out to me, until I searched the web, and this appears to be  a common defect and is happening a lot to MSI customers.

Rather than rip this thing apart and diagnose the problem, I called Amazon to replace it.

At first the Amazon rep said that, because this is a high dollar item, I would have to return it for a refund and repurchase it, effectively losing my black Friday discount. Then he called this a minor defect, and I corrected him that not being able use use some of the important ports of a new system (LAN, keyboard USB, mouse USB) is NOT a minor defect.

He said Amazon could not replace the system because it was a high dollar item, and could only refund it. I told him that this was not acceptable, and he checked with a supervisor. He then said that they could not replace the system because they didn't have any more in stock. I am pretty sure I verified that they had some in stock before I called Amazon, but I checked and indeed it was out of stock.

I asked if I could get it replaced by MSI since it was a new system shipped with a defect. He brought a MSI customer rep on line by the name of Hank to see if MSI could replace this defective system. Hank said that, since the system was sold by Amazon, MSI could not replace the system. I could send it in for warranty repair, but I would receive a refurbished system to replace my new, defective system, and that is not acceptable.

We finally agreed that Amazon would replace the system if they got a replacement in stock before my return window closes. I offered that I would not boot or initialize the system to make it easier for MSI to process the return and repair the defect, and the Amazon rep thanked me for that.

I am waiting for Amazon to get this product back in stock so I can keep my black Friday discount. I noticed that there is another vendor that has this product in stock for the same price as my black Friday discount with good reviews on Amazon, but searching reviews outside of Amazon I found many complaints, and I also found complaints with the Better Business Bureau, some of which seem to be unresolved, so I have decided not to purchase from them.",
"I had a problem with the first generation of the Surface Book where the battery of the tablet portion would refuse to charge. Between hardware improvements and firmware updates, this seems solved now. So I highly recommend this laptop.

Pros:

The detachable tablet mode is great. If you want to view a recipe in the kitchen, read a book on the screen without the weight of the base - tablet mode is great and easy to use.

The Surface Pen is mostly great. They sell a pack of interchangeable tips on the website. I've done some light drawing and various activities with the pen and the touchscreen - all input modes are great.

Plenty of ports. Unlike some competitors (Apple) this Surface has plenty of USB ""type A"" ports which makes it compatible with your existing peripherals.

Cons:

The second generation is notably heavier than the first. My wife finds it to be fairly cumbersome, and prefers the Surface Pro for weight reasons.

Firmware is still iffy. I did have a battery charging problem at one point, caused by bad drivers. The laptop battery was at 0% so it only worked connected to the base. I researched online and found out I had to uninstall the battery driver, and restart the system, to resolve it. If my base battery had been dead, the laptop would have been dead. Microsoft is not perfect yet, but they're a lot better than they used to be.

Overall:

A lovely laptop. Expensive, but feature-rich. As a great mobile laptop, drawing tablet, or general-purpose laptop this is a great choice.",
"I have a Microsoft Surface tablet, so this is a bit of leap-of-faith.  I did not like the Surface tablet due to its light integration with the keyboard. This device however is solid.  It can be fully used like a laptop on your lap, as well as a tablet when it is disconnected.
Like the Surface tablet though it lacks access to a sizable amount of apps that an ipad or an Android app would have, so impacts its use as a tablet.

However as a laptop, it’s pretty decent.

ITS SPECS
**** Intel 7th Gen Core i5
**** 8GB RAM
**** 256 GB Solid state
**** Intel HD Graphics 620
**** Display resolution max: 3000 x 2000 pixels
**** 13.5 PixelSense Touchscreen with pen input
**** 17 hour battery life

WHAT YOU GET:
The Surface Book itself which is a tablet attached to a keyboard. This is a well integrated connection, that makes you think of it as a 13” laptop. Detaching the tablet is a simple button push.  Reattaching it is as simple as pushing the two pieces back together.  This is an electronic release and relatch, and amazingly the laptop does not have to be turned on, to detach or attach.

LIGHTING KEYBOARD
The keyboard, is a lighting keyboard and I have noted when using it on your lap it can be hard to see the symbols on the keys, at the initial setting. . The contrast of the key color to the symbol color is quite low at the initial setting of the keyboard lighting.  So I have found myself in a fairly well lit room having to turn up the keyboard lighting, or turning it off entirely. Simple enough, but it concerned me at first. Once I tweaked the setting, it was fine.

POWER CABLES
The power cables which are in two pieces.  One from the computer to the transformer, which is the magnetic catch type seen in the Surface tablets.  The other is the transformer to the wall plug. This is a pet peeve of mine.  Here you have this elegant lap top solution and this big clunking transformer block.  You can slip this beautiful computer into a nice case, only to have this behemoth block, you need to find space for.  Granted it has sleeker lines that others, but it would be nice to have it a whole lot slimmer and an easy way to wrap up the cord

SETUP:
Setup is your typical Windows PC setup. This one like the tablet includes face recognition which is nice. Lighting can confuse it and you might have to repeat this process, but it is worth it. Sometimes too when it is looking for you, you may not have the top fully open, so the camera can’t see you.  Then you just put in your pin.

USAGE:
I’ve written all this review on this system, which isn’t that much typing, but being a touch typer, if the keyboard was set funny would have me swearing by now.  I once had an iPad keyboard solution that moved a few keys for size.  Drove me batty. While you don’t think you use a comma much, go ahead and move that on your keyboard and find out. This keyboard is nice and has the right feel.
Battery life is great. I’ve used it for hours and hours and plugged it in only after I noted it was in the 50% range.
Lap use. One thing that makes a laptop nice is its portability and this one with the 13.5” display makes it like a small laptop and it is  light and easy to carry around. . Even though the tablet is a heavier display, it does not cause balance issues on your lap when using as a laptop.

OTHERS OPINIONS:
I brought this device into work, to show two much younger colleagues that were enthusiastic to see  what it could do and how it was set up.
After playing with it for a day, I learned a few things.
You can charge the tablet separate from the keyboard, there is a slot on the side of the tablet.  I had never looked but this makes sense.
I thought the default display size for a browser, seemed small. But, being as I’m older did not trust that. They are in their mid twenties (both UI people) and they thought the size was small too.  Whenever you go to change this it gives you a warning and that other apps might be blurry but you could optimize for this. It kind of bothers me that the default is in the range of less usable.  We found the display default was 200%, we preferred 250%.

Both of them were unsure this product would have a use for them.
One had a PC desktop at home and a Mac laptop with a Mac laptop at work, so he was versed in both PC and Mac, but had no use for a laptop of this type and since this was a Windows tablet it’s appeal was limited.
The other had a Mac laptop at home and at work, but regularly does Microsoft app training, so was versed in Microsoft products. He felt the heavier screen since it was a separate tablet, made it unbalanced as a laptop.  Though he was a graphic designer, the removable tablet that you could draw on, had no appeal.  While he indicated this device was the best example of a 2 in 1 laptops, he was not sure he had a need for that type of device in retrospect.

Their joint concern was similar to mine in that usage as a tablet is limited by the available software. In order to give this device a fair shake, I was going to investigate what type of software for use in a tablet was available for this device.

SOFTWARE FOR THE WINDOWS TABLET:
I spent some time looking around on the tablet for Software. There seems to be a decent amount of Free pen drawing software (as well as ones you can buy) and a range of productivity software that is both paid and unpaid.  I don’t see a tremendous amount of games and that would typically be my use in a tablet form, along with maybe drawing.  So again, and like my colleagues this is a very limited tablet relative to an Apple or Android one.

OVERALL OPINION
For my own opinion, this is a PC laptop and not much of a tablet, unless I can find Windows apps to use.  As I noted above, I did find ones for the pen. But I can’t play the games I typically play on my ipad or my Android phone, because they are not on Windows. I have heard that Microsoft is coming out with a Microsoft Surface phone that is Android based. As much as this might irk Microsoft using a competitors OS, this would address the lack of usability of this tablet.
Mind you, if you would to buy a 2 in 1 laptop of any kind it would have the same issue.

Relative to PC laptops, if I put the specs into Dell or look online, this Surface book is priced comparable to a 2 in 1 laptop, except it specs for the display are 2X what the competition offers.",
"As a Vine reviewer, I am in an interesting position – I can compare this 2019 13.5” Surface Book 2 (SB2) to its larger cousin from 2017, the 15” Surface Book 2. You might be thinking: why is it called the same thing when it’s 2 years apart? Well, it was late 2017 and early 2019, so it’s more like 1.5 years, and I guess Microsoft just wanted to do a CPU refresh and not a wholesale overhaul. So you will be able to tell which is which by the CPU – Microsoft and Amazon call them the 7th Generation Core i5 and the 8th generation models, respectively. Pay close attention to this label, as often it is the only thing distinguishing the 2019 refresh from the 2017 original.

The SB2 model I am reviewing is the 8th gen Core i5, with 8gb of RAM and a 256gb SDD storage drive. GPU duties are handled by the Intel HD620 chip, which is included on the same die as the CPU. I am comparing it to my 15” SB2, with a 7th gen Core i7 CPU, paired with an nVidia GTX1060 GPU and 16gb of RAM.

*Productivity*

The 8th gen Core i5 and 8gb of RAM are more than powerful enough to make regular PC tasks like web surfing and word processing smooth as butter. You will not bog this machine down no matter how many browser tabs you have open.

Now that we are in e-learning and zoom meetings for work, I have found that the Surface Book cameras are really terrific. They look better than everyone else's we see in our school meetings. Pen input is also really useful for school assignments, both coloring and writing.

*Gaming*

Current 3D gaming is not really feasible on this unit. By this, I mean resource-intensive games like Hitman, Injustice 2, or Batman Arkham Knight. Both Hitman and Injustice 2 had to be reduced to quite ugly settings to run, and still stuttered quite badly. Arkham Knight wouldn’t even load. So you need to manage your expectations for Intel HD620 performance. It’s not equivalent to a modern GPU (like the SB2 15” model’s nVidia GTX1060). With that said, older 3D games run fine (like Portal 2 at high resolutions, The Talos Principle at middle resolutions, and even Skyrim on slightly reduced settings), and the CPU and display perform quite nicely on games like Civilization VI, Pac-Man Championship Edition, Braid, and Pinball Arcade/Pinball FX3. So it’s not a “gaming laptop” per se, but it can do some light gaming on the side.

*Drawing*

I do a lot of drawing on my 15” Surface Book 2. It has an nVidia GPU to help with rendering speed, so any difference in performance is something I am keenly interested in. I can report happily that the drawing performance on the 8th gen 13.5” SB2 in programs like Autodesk Sketchbook, Fresh Paint, and Medibang Pro is typically excellent for Surface products. I detected no differences between this unit and my SB2 Core i7 15” model.  That’s really saying something, too. Strokes are smooth and precise, and the pressure sensing is excellent. Photoshop on the i5 model does start to bog down with large brushes, but the pen performance is still good. All Surface models perform better with the pen while plugged in - running on battery seems to reduce jitter correction.

*Build Quality*

The 3000x2000 display is truly beautiful. It is every bit the equal of the 15” display, just slightly smaller. The colors pop but are not unnatural, the blacks are inky deep and do not shift at all when viewed from off angles. The resolution provides more than enough detail for a 1080p video. It is a bit below 4k resolution, but can provide almost all of that detail as well. Text is crisp and clean with no visible stair-stepping or pixels. At full brightness, it can compete with sunny room reflections. All in all, a total home run for a 13.5 inch screen.

Audio is quite good, with two front firing speakers located on the tablet portion. It is loud enough to fill a small room if you are watching a movie or listening to music, and there is no distortion at high volumes. There isn’t a whole lot of bass response, but it doesn’t sound tinny. There must be some decent psycho-acoustics at work approximating the bass elements of a particular audio presentation.

The keyboard and track pad are arguably the best in the industry right now, equaling the Macbook’s old keyboard (and far outclassing their recent butterfly keyboards). Key travel is wonderful and satisfying, and the track pad is precise, with a good firm click, and gestures that just work.

The unit itself is admirably thin. When placed on a table, the hand can hardly feel the body of the keyboard, it is so slender. The hinge functions without a hitch, releasing the tablet and reattaching it with a satisfying click. The tablet is certainly more manageable than the 15”, but still feels kind of ridiculously large compared to an iPad or Android equivalent.

The port selection is moderate, with 2 full-size USB 3.0 plugs and a full-size SD-card slot on the left, and 1 USB-C port on the right. The headphone jack resides on the tablet, unfortunately placed on the top right.

*Battery Life*

There are two batteries in this laptop, one in the keyboard base and one in the tablet. Both batteries are listed separately in Windows 10’s tool tray battery display. I did a run-down test – watching a 1080p movie via YouTube at half brightness and half volume, some light gaming, and web browsing, and the combined battery life between the two units was quite nice – a good 9-10 hours should be easily achievable at these sorts of moderate settings. The tablet alone will only get 3-4 hours, though.

*Who is this for?*

The question you need to ask yourself is if this unit is right for you. There are better gaming laptops to be had for equivalent money, certainly. And if you just want web browsing, you can get a very nice laptop from Dell or HP for about half the price. To me, the unique selling point is the Surface Pen and flippable tablet function. Turning the tablet around and closing the lid makes this a heck of a nice drawing pad – something I use frequently, but you might not.

This 13.5” Surface Book is also quite a bit more portable than the 15”, weighing significantly less and monopolizing far less bag space. But then, it’s not as portable as the Surface Pro with keyboard cover, which performs just as well as a drawing pad. So it’s kind of in a weird spot.

If you want to game relatively seriously and draw at home, then the 8th gen 13.5” sporting a GTX1050, or the 7th gen 15” with the GTX1060 are probably better bets for you. They are way more powerful to game on, and the 15” has more surface area for drawing on the screen.

On the other hand, If you want to draw and browse on the go, then the Surface Pro is probably a better fit. I was very seriously considering buying a smaller Surface tablet to have a more portable drawing slate. The Surface tablet with a Core i5 CPU/8gb RAM/128gb storage runs for about half the price of the 8th gen SB2 at around $700. That difference will buy you a lot of accessories, such as the Surface Pen, a keyboard cover, and a nice beefy SD card to augment storage. If you go with the SB2, you get a terrific keyboard but still have to buy the pen and any additional storage.

Please don’t get me wrong – the Surface Book 2 is a whale of a laptop, in whichever iteration you choose. It’s beautifully designed, in the way that, say, Apple’s best machines are. I just kind of think these mid-range iterations are a bit underpowered for the price, and that you can easily find smaller form factors or more powerful graphical muscle for less money. As such, I think it’s a 4 star machine. If it included the Surface Pen and had more storage for the price, I could probably be persuaded to go with 5 stars.",
"For starters, since Amazon mixes everything together, here are the specs of the Surface Book that I'm reviewing:

Surface Book 2 13.5"" screen
8gb RAM
256gb storage
Intel Core i5-8350U CPU

Having both a 2018 Macbook Pro (from work) and this, it's easy to see that Microsoft wants to target Macbook customers. Build quality is very similar. The Surface Book feels solid and its magnesium body feels great. It's a little warmer feeling than the cold aluminum used in the Macbook. And, like the Macbook, it's beautiful. It's not as svelte as a Macbook, however, but that's just the nature of the beast. When you pack all of the electronics into the screen, it's just going to be thicker, and the clever hinge is engineered in such a way that it can hold up all that weight. It's very cool looking too - like an accordion, it cinches up on itself as you close it and expands when you open it. It makes for a thicker hinge area, though, so even though the ""clipboard"" (screen/tablet) portion just a little thicker than 1/4"", when folded over on the keyboard section (which also includes a bigger battery) it's pretty close to 1"" thick.

This Surface Book was going to be a secondary computer, as I have a big Alienware desktop that I use, but almost immediately I found that I simply enjoyed using the Surface Book much more. It's not even about portability, as I use it most often at my desk plugged into a monitor. It's that the Surface Book is fast and nimble in ways my 5 year old Alienware machine is not. I also prefer the keyboard - it's close to the great keyboards Apple used to put in the Macbooks (several years ago) and is far superior to the ""new"" low-action keyboard in the current Macbooks.

The touchpad is Apple quality, seriously. I'm shocked, actually, because I've never found any non-Apple trackpads to be particularly nice. With the gestures built into Windows, I'm pretty closely able to recreate the way I work on a Macbook trackpad.

On the left of the keyboard you'll find two USB 3 ports as well as an SD card slot. On the right is the Surface connector port and a single USB-C. The clipboard houses a single port - the headphone jack - so forget connecting a drive to the clipboard. But the Surface charger will connect directly to the clipboard, if that appeals to you. It really feels as if Microsoft doesn't *really* want you to use the clipboard by itself.

I use this computer for pretty much everything now. I'm an amateur photographer and pretty bad artist, so I use Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom a lot along with Sketchable (available in the Windows app store.) Photoshop is a demanding beast. It will take around 5 minutes to open on my Alienware box but on the Surface it opens just about as fast as on my Macbook Pro, which is around 20 seconds or so. For normal tasks like lightly editing a photo it works fine (and Lightroom equally works well for photo edits.) Some of Photoshop's complex brushes, such as the textured Kyle's brushes, push it to its limit and you'll find yourself waiting a moment for the results to catch up on screen. I don't typically use Photoshop for painting, however, and in an app like Sketchable I find that drawing and painting is fluid and extremely smooth.

But about that painting and drawing...

Microsoft seriously needs to stop being stingy. The Surface line is *always* advertised with a Surface Pen. They are meant to be together and the Surface Pen really complements the Surface. I knew going in that Surfaces don't include that great Pen, but it doesn't diminish the sting of having to buy one to get the most out of the device. Of course, you can work on the Surface just fine without one, but then it's basically just a touchscreen laptop. I don't know about you, but the appeal of the Surface for me is that I can use multiple methods of input depending on what works best at the time. It's short-sighted and cheap of Microsoft to continue making the Pen an extra charge.

That said, with the Pen, you can write and draw to your heart's desire. The Pen works beautifully, bested only by Apple's Pencil on the iPad, and they're very close in feel.

The trick to the Surface Book is that the screen, called the ""clipboard,"" can be removed. It can be used on its own, as it has a small battery inside, but you'll only get a couple hours out of it that way. The main battery is found in the keyboard base and you'll need it if you want to work on it all day. The clipboard can then be flipped around and reconnected, then closed over the keyboard. I call this ""fat tablet"" mode. It gives the screen a small slope, which is nice for drawing, but most of all it lets the keyboard battery be used. This is a great mode in which to draw or take notes. It's a little heavy to hold up like this, not surprisingly, but the clipboard battery life is significantly shorter than it is with the base.

One little thing bugs me about going into ""fat tablet"" mode. While in laptop mode, you have both an onscreen detach button (found in the ^ menu in the clock tray) as well as a detach button on the keyboard. When you've flipped the screen around, for some dumb reason, the only button that is available to detach again is the one on the keyboard, which is obviously hidden away. Why isn't the on-screen detach button available in this mode? It makes things really awkward.

Other little bits:

Speakers are actually pretty decent, with the caveat that these are, unsurprisingly, tiny speakers. They're quite loud and clear, but lack bass, which is not shocking.

The screen is beautiful. Great colors, very sharp, and the touchscreen is very responsive. Now Microsoft just has to match it with a better tablet experience in Windows.

Battery life so far has been excellent. Microsoft's blue-sky estimate of 17 hours is probably not realistic for any actual humans, but in my use so far it's easily enough battery for going all day without a charger, unless you're going heavy on the Photoshop where you'll need to boost the battery for ""best performance"" (or else Photoshop performance will be seriously hindered.) The charger is the typical Surface charger with the proprietary magnetic connector, and the separate housing for the charger includes a USB for charging other devices. Makes you wonder why Microsoft couldn't just include a dock that could connect to your monitor and other devices, doesn't it?

All said and done, I really enjoy this computer. It's not cheap, I know, and I know you can find faster computers for less, but they also feel like ""less."" It's important to know what you really want and need out of a computer. For me, I wanted Macbook-like build quality and I've got that here. I also own a Surface Pro 1 that is nearing 6 years old and it still works great, so I have had good experiences with Microsoft devices. I have read of some issues on Surface Books but mine so far has worked flawlessly, and I hope I don't have to change that - but if something happens, I'll definitely update this review to reflect that.",
"Battery is melting inside. It started bulging about a year after I bought it, I thought batery just gets warm and deforms plastic. But it is actually battery itself bulging and deforming. this morning I noticed the bottom is all opened up. It is a piece of ... computer. I paid for it as much as I could've paid for apple. But I was hoping Microsoft went too far ahead from my 90's last computer... not really, they are deeper in a hole now. I've had all kind of problems with it ever since I bought this damn thing and the microsoft store wouldn't do anything, all they do is pay lip service and try to get rid of you, they do not want to take this ""product"" back. I was stuck with this thing. I should've gotten apple to replace my old apple. This melting ""computer"" if I can call it like that is now DANGEROUS because of the melting battery. save your money and trouble, get something better than this piece of ...",
"This is intended to be the best of both worlds - part tablet PC and part laptop. Unfortunately, the result is that it doesn't do a very good job of either.

Tablet features: The screen can un-dock from the keyboard, and re-dock in reverse to make using it as a tablet a bit easier. But the screen is so bulky, that I rarely actually use it as a tablet. I wouldn't think of walking around with just the screen (due to size), and reversing it in a meeting to make note-taking easier is awkward. It is a beautiful touch-screen, but since I use it mostly as a laptop, I rarely use it. The Microsoft Stylus is probably the best on the market - but it costs quite a bit extra.

Laptop features: This is almost as good as a standard laptop. Except that the monitor opens only a little wider than a 90-degree angle. So if you actually want to use it on your lap or on a plane, you may be frustrated.

In my opinion, you'll be better served purchasing a standard laptop and/or tablet. Or, if you're looking at a slightly better compromise, consider something like the Yoga or possibly the Surface Pro.",
"Honestly, this has been a great device for just over three years. Three years being the limit for their responsibility.

That is the issue though. Last week I noticed that my touch screen was acting weird. On top of that, my batteries began to die very quickly. This week I noticed that the laptop wouldn't close all the way. On closer inspection today, I can see now that My screen is bulging out. The entire top part of my surface book has begun expanding. There are multiple pressure points around the edges of the display and even the metal frame is warped like some sick smile (very noticeably the entire top of the frame is curved).

So I have had this device just over three years, and because I was a little too late to call them I'm out of luck. This is a known issue with this device and several other surface devices. Do a quick search for ""surface battery swelling"" if you would like. Instead of letting owners know about the potential fire hazard stored in their homes/car/office, they've hidden this info so as to prevent as many as possible from getting it fixed. I cannot afford a new device right now... especially not with both mine and my wife's hours being reduced due to Covid-19.

I called support to see if they could do anything for me and they were willing to send me a refurbished device for $600+tax. When I explained that I couldn't afford that I was told that there were other options I could explore online. I asked where to do that and was directed to Microsoft's home page. I asked for clarification because I was still under the impression this person was trying to help me. They told me to click ""Surface"" in the menu at the top of the screen. I did and it took me to the sales page for their surface line. ""There are lots of options here"" they told me. How in the hell are these ""options"" if I cannot afford the $600 fee for your defective battery?!

Needless to say I am pissed. My device is in mint condition but I missed the cutoff by a couple weeks for this known and potentially dangerous issue. Microsoft support has washed their hands of me and sent me off with a big middle finger to purchase a new device.",
"There’s some great and accurate reviews on this machine that will tell you all the specs and performance issues with this Surface Book. Thinking this might be a good option for my occasional forays into the PC world as I spend a lot of time in the Mac world, I thought I’d give this a try. I’ve been using it for a few weeks now and have tried my best to be objective about it. But I’ve been really frustrated, actually.

The video glitches all the time and just can’t keep up with basic stuff. I have connection issues with WiFi. It glitches with photo editing. And what drives me crazy is that it’s constantly updating. It’s much heavier than a laptop and, separated, it’s heavier than a pad. It’s dead weight lugging it around. If it were worth it, performance wise, I’d be less bothered by the weight.

I seriously should have gone with a lighter, better performing and less expensive laptop. I was hoping for a better overall experience but this just isn’t my thing. I tried but it’s going to stay at home from now on.",
"So my only complaint about Microsoft devices as a whole is their lack of compatibility with Linux.  This one is better than the other 4 I have owned.  It still isn't working well with CentOS, but Kubuntu works awesomely, and I also have Kali running.  I've got a tripple boot (with Windows as well) set up, and the whole thing took about 5 hours to set up.  If you're looking for a laptop to run Linux on, that is light and has a great battery, the choice is this one or the XPS.  The XPS (my friend has one) doesn't run touchscreen, but it is lighter than this one and gets even better battery...

Overall, this laptop has a great battery, a great screen, and runs Linux with very little effort.  The only downsides are the requirement to have power connected in order to detach the screen (yes, the button does work in Linux), the fact that all ports (USB, SD and charging included) are on the base (so in tablet mode it can't charge, can't read an SD card, and can't use a USB device), and the fact that it is so sealed that you can't upgrade or repair it yourself.  Those are the reasons I dropped one star (personally, I'd drop 4 stars for all that, but I know most people wouldn't).",
"First, there seems to be some question as to what generation i5 processor is in this model.  It is an 8th generation processor.  I already have a Surface Tablet with the 7th generation i7 in it and I can’t tell any noticeable difference even though this in an i5 instead of the previous generation i7.  My tablet also has 16gb of RAM whereas this “Book” only has 8gb.  Again I have yet to have a problem while running any programs including Adobe CS and third party filters.  I am very impressed with the overall feel of the unit.  I have heard some people express concerns with the keyboards ability to hold up under heavy use.  However, it seems pretty good and the feel of the keys is near perfect to me.  I usually take very good care of my computers so I doubt if I will ever have a problem with it.  However if you are looking for something along the lines of mil-spec hardware built to take anything you can do to it then of course this is not it.  The 13.5 inch screen is bigger than the tablet I have gotten use to using.  On the other hand this PC is much smaller and lighter than my current laptop and that is a good thing.  I ordered a leather case for it and even with that is will be a laptop I would not think twice about taking on the road, which I never do with my big 15 inch laptop.  If I want I can also easily detach the screen from the keyboard and use it as a touch screen only tablet.  I never put much stock in advertised battery run time since so much depends on how each person uses their PC and actual run time can differ significantly between users.  I can say already though that it seems to run significantly longer than my old Surface Tablet and I am happy about that.  I certainly do recommend this laptop.  If you can afford it I would still suggest you max out the processor, RAM, and storage if you feel you may have need of something more powerful.  But if you don’t plan on using it for heavy gaming or other power hungry stuff then the i5 with 8gb RAM should suffice.",
"This surface book is an extremely great device to have. First thing I would say is this is a great laptop. It is a bit on the thicker side compared to many other laptops but with the amount of power it has I see no issues with it. It uses the traditional power brick charger as the surface pro 4 however the actual brick is a bit bigger than usual. The surface is very quick on boot up and does have facial unlock. One of the things I would say about this is that in order to charge it you actually need to have it plugged into the dock and keyboard. You cannot charge the tablet separate from the actual dock. The dock/keyboard itself has its own battery as well as the tablet. You can easily charge the keyboard and dock while using the tablet. I would be careful on how far back you push the screen as the hinge will only go back so far. I would say from the 90 degree it can move back an additional 15 degrees back before it stops. Do not force the tablet screen back any further or you will break it. Another thing is if you are planning to use this on you lap, be careful when opening and closing as the hinge has gaps that your hair or skin can get caught in if you have it on your skin. The external surface is very easy to scratch so I would recommend that you get a skin to protect it or get a laptop case for it. The tablet itself is locked to the keyboard and the only way to remove it is to either detach it in windows or just press the detach button on the top right. It does take a few seconds but you will know it is safe to remove when you hear a click. The tablet can be rotated around and put back into the dock and closed. This makes it nice to turn into a tablet as well as protecting your keyboard. The touch screen is super sensitive as well as accurate. It does not come with a pen however if you are an artist or writer then I would recommend getting one. The facial recognition is great and makes it easy for me to unlock my laptop without needing to type in the pin. There is a front and back camera that will record at at least 720p. I would not really record an event with the camera however it is nice to know you have that option. The microphone also is very clear and I have not had any issues with any sound issues. It usually does not pick up surrounding noise and focuses more on voice. On the tablet itself, there is a 3.5 port to plug in headphones/microphone. It does have dual band wifi built in and no issues with speed.

The tablet itself can last about six to eight hours on its own and an additional eight or so hours plugged into the dock. The overall charge time depends but it can take up to a full night to charge both the tablet and the dock to 100% from what I can tell. Normally a full night will last me until dinner time the next day which is pretty good, but you can probably shave the time off with adjusting brightness. One minor complaint about this product is that it arrives 100% battery drained. So if you have this device and it does not power on then just leave it plugged in for 30 minutes to an hour and try again. It has a really fast boot up being less than ten seconds to boot up and it can be set to automatically scan and detect your fast to unlock. There is 8 gb of ram which is pretty standard for most laptops nowadays that work well with most of the application. There is really no lag between application. There is also plenty of storage space however I would recommend to just use an external hard drive to store pictures and videos as 256 gb will run out pretty fast. It has two USB 3.0 ports on the left side as well as a type c on the left next to the charging port. The transfer speed is quick depending on the usb device you have. There is no usb port on the actual tablet itself unfortunately. The speaker system is pretty loud and the heat from this unit is not bad. It does get warm on the tablet and the keyboard when it is in use but that is normal. The edges of the keyboard are slightly slanted down and there is a magnet on the tablet top and the bottom of the keyboard to secure the book closed. The processor is an i5 which is good enough power for what I need it to do. It can play some games but i would say not at the best quality but it can play some at low settings. The processing speed is really fast and it works really well for what I need. You can connect this to a dock or monitor however you will need a type c to hdmi or a usb 3.0 to hdmi adapter to get the video output. It can handle two screens if you have the right adapter at pretty good resolution. Overall this is a great laptop to have and I would suggest you to get this surface book if you want something that is powerful but still have the tablet option.",
"Right off the bat let me say I really love this Surface Book 2. It's the best laptop I've ever had, and I've had quite a few. It has entirely cured my latent MacBook Pro envy, to the point where some of my coworkers now have Surface Book2 envy. That said, this is only possible because I run Linux on the machine instead of Windows 10, and not without some issues. Allow me to summarize:

The Good
========
1. You can run Linux Ubuntu 19.10 on this machine with nearly full support
2. Laptop size, weight, screen resolution - all top notch
3. Carrying this thing around, you will be super cool
4. Touchpad, touchscreen, detachable screen, wifi, audio, etc. all work great
5. Battery lasts all day
6. USB-C port drives monitor and charges laptop battery simultaneously

The Bad
========
1. You must install one specific patched version of the Linux kernel
2. The built-in camera won't work under Linux

The Ugly
========
1. You need to keep a dual-boot system running Win10, for firmware updates
2. Bluetooth support is, well, meh

To clarify, here are some specific observations:

The Kernel! First of all, this machine only runs Linux as well as it does thanks to the hard work of the guys who put together the ""jakeday surface linux"" repository on Github. Google it, follow the simple instructions, and all will work well. But this patch-set only runs on Linux Kernel version 5.1.15, which is now, i.e. 10NOV2019, somewhat behind the latest Ubuntu 19.10 (5.3.0-19) distribution. Doubtless it will get updated at some point, but as of this writing it hasn't been updated in five months.

Ubuntu! You're pretty much stuck with using the Ubuntu distro. Some intrepid hackers have forked the jakeday patches for ArchOS - good luck with that. Or if you prefer jakeday gives instructions for building on any Debian-based system - again, good luck, because the base linux kernel repository no longer goes back to stable version 5.1.15, meh. As a side note, hitherto I was a Linux ""Mint"" user, so the switch to native Ubuntu has been an adventure.

The camera, blech! Forget it, the patches will not get the camera working. I have a cheap external camera I use for video conferencing when necessary. Someday maybe someone will get this patched, but I wouldn't hold my breath.

Bluetooth! It works, don't get me wrong, but it's flaky. Sometimes I have to reload the bluetooth drivers to get devices to work right.

Dual boot! If you want to do firmware upgrades you need to keep Windows 10 installed on a partition, as a dual-boot option. No one I've found knows how to update the firmware outside of Win10. This wastes about 50GB of the precious 250GB SSD drive space.

Fast, fast, fast! Geekbench4 clocks this thing at 4662 single-core and 11449 multi-core. It's the fastest machine in my office, running our Cypress test suite half again faster than anyone else. I'll post the geekbench4 link in a comment.

Wifi, touchpad, touchscreen, detachable screen, wifi, audio, sdcard, USB-C dock! All that stuff works great. Touch-Ubuntu is fun to play with, but to be honest I never use it. I'm more of a full-stack software engineer than a casual note-taker.

USB-C Docking Bay! One Single-Cable Connection! I use the SB2 to drive a gorgeous 38"" ultra wide Dell monitor at 3840x1600 resolution. This is with the simple Intel video chipset and not the special Nvidia version. At the same time the SB2 is driving the Dell monitor through the USB-C port, the Dell monitor is charging the SB2 battery through the same cable. This means all I have to do is set my laptop down on my desk, attach one single USB-C cable, and I'm done. All connected, no power, no nothing else. One wire. The Holy Grail has finally been attained - this is the setup they'll hand out at orientation in Heaven.

Retinal Display! The resolution of the internal laptop display is 3240x2160. The Intel chip can drive it simultaneously with my external 3840x1600 display, as a dual-monitor setup. This works fine, but unless you have a magnifying-glass vision you'll want to configure Ubuntu to drive the laptop display at a scaling level of 150% or higher. This is a simple button-click GUI operation, so no worries.

tldr; get this laptop, set it up for dual-boot to Ubuntu 19.10 running the ""jakeday surface linux"" kernel. Apart from the camera everything will work, and you'll be the envy of all your friends.",
"Disclaimer: I walked away from Windows years ago and jumped to the Mac world. This is my first venture back.

Cosmetically, it's a good looking unit. Built sturdy. Seems durable. The screen is big and bright and appears to be very sharp when viewing photos or videos. And the thing seems quite fast. Web pages load quickly (I did testing without the built in apps so I used Chrome and other third party software) and overall setup was pretty easy. Although I've been away from Windows for almost eight years the environment hasn't changed that much and I was pretty much at home pretty quickly. I even found my way out to DOS (you remember DOS, right?) without any issues.

But I really don't like the keyboard. I do a lot of writing that ranges from the typical email to editing a non-profit's monthly newsletter and everything in between. I tried to like this keyboard. I couldn't. Things just seemed to be just slightly in the wrong place. I don't think I'd enjoy working on this one for any length of time.

The big feature of this device seems to be the screen that detaches and can serve as a tablet. I can see where that would come in handy since I use my iPod for things like client demos and when I head out to hang in coffee shops. I'm not sure I'd do that with this screen. First, it's a bit large and ungainly. While the size is nice for those of us with aging eyes, it just doesn't seem comfortable in my hand and I have the overwhelming fear that I'm going to drop the thing. But that's not my biggest issue with it. All of the ports are on the keyboard. I couldn't, as an example, take this with me to a meeting and charge it if the meeting ran long. If I was going away for a weekend I'd need to take the whole kit with me. If you're looking for the convenience of a tablet this might not fit the bill.

So I'm still playing with it. I picked it up because I still have friends and relatives using Windows and I've been out of practice when it comes to answering their questions. I thought it might be fun to test the waters after all these years. It was amusing, but maybe not fun. If you can get your hands on one for testing I'd make a strong suggestion that you do that before you commit to making this your main machine.",
"We have a number of surface tablets in our house, and this was my first surface book. I got it hoping for some increased performance for using with my landscape CAD program, and I did notice a difference in the smoothness when working with CAD on this device as opposed to my other comparable surface tablets. The better performance only works when it is hooked up to the keyboard, which is fine for CAD work.

I also like to use this as a tablet for photo editing work related to my business, and here I noticed my number one complaint about this device, which is that the tablet part itself does not have the little foldout stand that all of the other surface tablets have. I guess they think that you will just connect it to the keyboard, but sometimes I want it to be as flexible and lightweight as a regular surface Pro tablet, and while you can unhook it from the keyboard and use it as a tablet, it feels more bulky and the lack of stand makes it less flexible in its use than the surface Pro tablets.

One thing I did notice is that you can connect it to the keyboard backwards and use the keyboard as a stand that way, however that does not bend to the same angle as the tablet stands do on a regular surface Pro.

I also think that the battery life is a lot less on this one than on the surface Pro tablets. Even when not connected to the keyboard and the increased computing performance that you get from that, it seems to wear down its batteries on tablet mode in about 30 to 45 minutes of photo editing. When I worked on my surface tablet in this fashion, I feel like I got a little less than two hours before having to recharge.

Overall, if you plan to use this primarily plugged in as a laptop and only occasionally as a tablet, the increased performance from the attached keyboard make this a worthwhile choice if you do gaming or more high-powered computing. However, if you are primarily using it as a tablet or in places where battery life is a critical consideration, I would suggest the regular surface Pro tablet instead.

In terms of accessories, I use the surface pen constantly, but haven't reached for the other accessories much at all. The surface pen makes it so smooth to make notes on photographs to convey ideas to people, and is great for photo editing.",
I thought this was a great idea at first.  It updates when it wants to.  It downloads gigabytes for each download stealing your hard drive space.  It seems like every time I have an important job to do in a hurry this thing is automatically updating.  I made modifications in the code to stop updates well they updated and removed my modifications.  It is also a spy machine.  It uploads everything to Microsoft.  Why do they want my kids pictures all of my files it sends an image of the entire operating system.  I do my taxes on it and fill out PDFs with private information it just uploads everything and you cannot stop it.  I even tried putting this thing on airplane mode so it can stop downloading gigs worth of updates.  That does not work.  The thing will slow down what I’m doing so it can download gigs worth of information as well as upload gigs of info.  This is crazy. This is the worst investment ever.  If they are going to rely on my information to make money why isn’t this thing free?  So u charge me 2 grand for the thing to spy on me then you make even more money with my info.  Stay away.  Also it downloads stuff On it’s own my desktop always has some new game some new program they want me to try.  Why are they downloading stuff in my computer.  The privacy policy is tricky and I studied law.  It links you to places with broken links.  It wants you to login and the information is in so many different websites it’s ridiculous.  If I could get my money back I would.  It also has a tablet mode that is useless.  You go in tablet mode and everything disappears? What? It could have been alright if it never had windows 10 and their spyware. If you buy this make sure you get the one that has a huge hard drive and get huge SD cards.  The updates will eat up all your space mine is full am using it because I had an extra sd card good luck giving away your privacy to someone who is selling it.,
"Overall: The newest surface is a phenomenal product and it keeps improving every year. The screen quality is truly impressive and this is a tablet/laptop is a generous size to easily accomplish goals and multi-task. The computer is very fast and easily processes your multi-tasking. There are a few minor things that made it slightly less enjoyable but these did not detract much from my enjoyment of the system. The computer is really a powerhouse or beast of a system and replaces the need to have both a laptop and a tablet. This makes it a very convenient choice for professionals because it showcases presentations but can also be used personally.

Pros: The screen is absolutely gorgeous and that is one of the best features. It is perfect for streaming movies/TV shows, checking emails, playing games, etc.  It is also easy to switch into work mode and get a lot accomplished on Microsoft Office products / Adobe / Internet (Chrome).  It runs multiple applications very well with it’s 16 GB memory and has a lightning-fast processor for most basic tasks of the common user.  Even when doing a lot of processing, the computer runs quiet and does not run hot which are important features. It’s fairly easy to switch between tablet and laptop mode just by clicking it in and out.  There is a button that shows the eject on the keyboard.  You will then be prompted on whether or not you would like it to be in tablet mode or stay in tablet mode. Another amazing advantage is the battery life. It easily lasts twice as long as a standard laptop and I’ve gotten very long life spans out of it as it easily makes it past 15 hours.

Cons: One strange thing that I noticed is that when the battery is low, it will not allow me to detach the tablet from the keyboard.  This is unusual because I can charge it either on the keyboard or on the tablet directly. It’s surprisingly heavy for a tablet, due to it packing a lot of processing power.  It is noticeably harder to manipulate in the hand compared to more standard tablets when using it in tablet mode. Also, while the product page shows some of the connected devices like the pen, wireless mouse, etc. it does not come with any of those so they must be ordered separately. It only arrives with the keyboard stand.  Another aspect that I have noticed is that on occasion it glitches in tablet mode and the keyboard does not pop up when I am filling out forms or attempting to type.
Bottom Line-  It is a wonderful choice and you really are getting the definition of versatile.",
"Let me start off by stating this is not your typical Surface.  The Microsoft Surface is a tablet, which may or may not include with it some sort of soft felt/leathery keyboard connected to the tablet via bluetooth.  The tablet also has a kick stand that helps it stay upright.

The Surface Book is a laptop.  It opens/closes and feels like your typical laptop.  But it's not your typical laptop.  With the touch of a button, the Tablet screen detaches from the solid, back-lit keyboard.

How does this work?  The connection is maintained by what feels like two electromagnetic tabs which embed into the Tablet screen about 10-15mm.  There are also 3 multi-pin connections which I suspect provide power, video, and USB connection to/from the keyboard section.  These are all hidden when the Tablet is docked to the keyboard.  The keyboard section provides the Tablet with a second battery, two 'standard' USB 2.0 ports, one SD Card Slot, one USB Type-C slot and a power slot.
Here's a few random notes on the keyboard: the keyboard section feels like it actually weighs more than the Tablet when separated.  The button to release the Tablet looks like a standard key on the keyboard, next to the Del key, above the backspace.  The hinge is also unique in that it's like a C-shape.  The laptop won't close at a perfectly straight angle like most laptops.  Despite this fact, there don't seem to be any weak points in the hinge.  I personally would think that the weak points are the shallow tabs that connect the keyboard and Tablet together.  They don't seem big enough to withstand a whole lot of tug/pull, so I am careful not to handle it too rough.

The Tablet is amazing.  When detached from the keyboard, it is lightweight and ultra-responsive.  It responds very well to third-party 'electric' pens that allow me to create hand-drawn designs just as if it were pencil/paper.  However, there are a couple of notes to this design:
There is a single port on the tablet.  However, instead of going with the industry standard USB Type-C connection, Microsoft decided to go with its own weird connection.  It is the same connection which is used to provide power to the Keyboard.  Thus, the same power cable used to power/charge the Keyboard also charges/powers the Tablet.  I also read that there are data cables that convert this weird connection to USB Type-C, which theoretically could provide data transfer ability AND power straight to/from the Tablet (without the Keyboard).  However, I don't know if the port on the Tablet will allow video/data to go in/out without the Keyboard attached.  The cable descriptions state ""Doesn't support data transfer or video output, only be used for charging your Surface.""  You can search ""Surface Connect to USB-C Charging Cable"" on Amazon if you are curious.

Despite its few drawbacks, as long as you view this as a laptop that turns into a Tablet instead of a Tablet which turns into a laptop, you won't be disappointed.",
"The Surface Book 2 with an i5 8250U processor is the third Surface Book I've owned. I had an original i7 with a dGPU, a Surface Book 2 i7 with a dGPU, and now this i5 8250U without a dGPU. (If you're curious, I returned the SB2 i7 because the screen weight made it too wobbly.)

The first thing I noticed after installing all of the patches available, was how zippy the system was. I've stuck with i7 CPU's for the past few years, because you can ""feel"" how slow the i5's are by comparison. In this iteration of the Surface Book 2, the i5 8250U mostly (MOSTLY!) seems to give the i7 8650U in my ThinkPad Yoga X1 a run for its money.

Once you really start to put it through its paces, you'll start to notice that it isn't quite a modern i7. But to that end, I'm talking about moving large projects back and forth in Photoshop and Lightroom, or rendering video. For the vast majority of average use, you probably wouldn't notice the difference between the two processors -- except the Surface Book 2 doesn't give you the same kind of fan noise you'd get on a ThinkPad Yoga with an i7.

As for the rest of the system, it's just about everything you've probably read about Surface Books. The display is gorgeous, and has a wonderful aspect ratio for getting things done. When it comes to 15"" laptops, I can't think of a single one where I'd say the display is universally better than what you'll get in a Surface Book 2.

Similarly, the Surface Book 2 offers some of the cleanest sound I've experienced in a non-gaming laptop, and despite what ThinkPad purists may say, the keyboard is as good or better than just about any ThinkPad Lenovo has made in the past 4 - 5 years.  (Oh, W520... how I miss your awe-inspiring keyboard...) And of course, you get all the benefits of a display than can be detached and / or flipped, though I think the 15"" model is a bit big for using as a tablet for extended use. Pair it up with a Surface Pen (or Wacom Bamboo Ink, if money's really tight) and you've got a lovely setup for art, sketching, and document markup.

It's a lovely machine, but I wouldn't buy it. And here's why:

As of summer 2019 when I'm writing this, this specific i5 model is kind of like a Surface Book 2.5, since it was recently updated. Yet, Microsoft still hasn't quite figured out how to make the hinge stronger or display lighter, such that it doesn't wobble incessantly if you're a... ""spirited"" typist. Frankly, I was disappointed to see that this hadn't been addressed, as it's been a known problem for going on two years.

Second, unless you absolutely must have a detachable screen and can't come up with the money for a dGPU model, this is a pretty awful value. You could save tons of money on a Surface Laptop 2, if you're just using this as a laptop and don't have very specific criteria.

Third, holy wow, is this heavy. I hadn't realized how spoiled I was with my ThinkPad Yoga X1, or even my regular Surface Pro 5. You're almost certainly going to want / need a decent laptop bag for this, which is probably going to annoy anyone who hasn't moved towards laptop folios for going back and forth between home and work / school.

So, it's not that this is a bad laptop. It definitely isn't. But unless you have a perfect combination of needs and available cash that has you looking at the i5 without dGPU, I'd either put more money toward a dGPU model, or consider a different model like the Surface Laptop 2, Surface Pro with a keyboard cover, or a convertible like the Lenovo X1 Yoga or Dell XPS 2-in-1 series.",
"This is a hybrid computer that can be used as a laptop or a tablet. The external dimensions of the computer are 13.5”x10”x1”; the device weighs 3.8 lbs. Actual screen dimensions are 12.5”x8.5”. The keyboard has a standard Windows layout with no numeric keypad. Below the keyboard is a touchpad. The screen can be detached from the keyboard and used as a tablet since it is a touchscreen. The battery is integrated with the screen and is not removable. The battery takes a complete charge in a few hours and is rated to last up to 17 hours. On the left edge of the keyboard are 2 USB A ports and an SD card slot. On the right edge are 1 USB C port and a charging port. Power and volume buttons are on the top edge of screen. There is a front camera with microphone at the front center of the screen and a rear camera in the top corner. The computer comes with a charging transformer and cable; all other accessories like a stylus are sold separately.

The processor is an Intel i5-8350U running at 1.7Gh. The device comes with 16 Gb RAM installed. The hard drive is solid state with 238 Gb of useable space. Both the screen and keyboard are sealed, so the memory and hard drives cannot be upgraded or replaced after purchase.

I am very pleased with how this device works for portable computing. It boots up quickly, the keyboard is smooth and easy to type on, and the ability to detach the screen and use it as a large format tablet is really slick. The screen has a very clear display, and the touchscreen is quite responsive. Unlike many other laptops that I have tried, the 16 Gb of installed RAM means Windows and applications run quite well without getting bogged down. The SSD hard drive is also much faster than you would get with a mechanical drive. On the other hand, the Intel i5-8350U processor is not screaming fast, so this is no high-powered gaming machine. Still, for most professional office or student purposes, this computer will do just fine. The 238 Gb hard drive is big enough for creating and storing office documents. But if you do media-heavy creative work (like serious photography), you would probably want to store your media on an external drive rather than the small drive that comes with this machine. The computer comes preloaded with Win10 and Microsoft Edge (browser). If you want to use other Microsoft software (like Office, Word, Excel, Powerpoint, etc) on this computer, you either need to purchase a subscription or purchase the software outright. (There is no optical drive on this computer, but you can connect an external optical drive, sold separately, if you wish).

The only design issue that I have found with this device is the location of the ports. I find an external mouse much more comfortable to use than a touchpad. But the USB A ports on this device are both on the left side. So my right-handed mouse cord has to snake around the back of the machine. Meanwhile, my external hard drive has a USB C cable, so it needs to get connected to the right side of the machine, where it gets tangled up with the mouse cable. If only the USB C port was on the left and there was a USB A port on the right. Or…if the ports had just been on opposite sides, with USB C and charging on the left, and USB A and SD card on the right, cabling would have been so much simpler!

These minor design quibbles aside, this device is excellent for mobile computing. The battery seems to last forever—all day and the next as well. The screen is beautiful, and the computer has enough RAM to support Windows 10 running multiple applications at once.",
"I want to point out the difference!  Because, not long ago, detaching the screen or monitor from your computer or laptop meant that the screen or monitor turned into a tablet that only worked with apps.  That is NOT what's going on here!  I'd guess that this is not news to most who have grown up with the latest and greatest in technology.  But for others, who are more isolated from what's new, this might cause some confusion.

I got this Surface Book--a laptop with a detachable screen--because I wanted to run Corel software on the detached screen.  Programs such as Painter, PaintShop, CorelDraw and more, install, load and run smoothly on this Surface Book.  Removed from the base with the keyboard, I can draw right on my lap, or flat on a table.  Turn the screen around, attached but facing away from the keyboard, I can draw on an angle, on a slight incline.  I can use the Surface pen with my Corel programs, too.

While I fully appreciate, and am somewhat in awe of, the fact that sophisticated, large and intricate programs run quickly and smoothly on this screen--apart from its mother board--I have noticed just two things that prevent me from awarding this a 5-star rating:
--It runs hot.  While I want to hold it on my lap, the heat makes it uncomfortable to do so.  The heat is distracting, too.
--The screen does not hold its position firmly.  Put a bit of pressure on the screen and you'll lose your angle.

The touch screen is sensitive.  I suppose that is both a positive and a negative.  The Surface Pen does not come included, but it is a worthwhile--almost necessary add-on.  So, for the price point of this Surface Book, I'd think they could include it in the package.  The pen is magnetized and will attach itself to the Book, but I don't ever count on it staying in place.

Battery life is good.  I do appreciate the magnetized ""plug-in"" to the base.

Screen color is bright and sharp.  No complaints there.  It provides pretty, pretty visuals.

I hate the Microsoft eye recognition.  Sometimes I wear glasses, sometimes I don't.  If you want to utilize the eye recognition feature, make sure your glasses are either always on or always off.  I'm glad to say that you don't need to use the eye recognition if you don't want to--it is a preference that you can turn off.  But logging into Microsoft, which is a choice on other makes of computers and laptops, is not a choice here.  You must have a log-in or a Pin to gain access to your Book.",
"Being a generous person, I let my partner try out the new Surface Book that arrived at our house. Here's his review. He's

About a year ago I decided to switch from Mac to Windows for my work computer needs. I started with a generic (but attractive) ultrabook, then acquired a Microsoft Surface Go to reduce weight. Even though it's underpowered, I found the Surface Go's hybrid (laptop/tablet) usage model really attractive. I got a Surface Pen, and experimented with using the Go as a regular tablet, replacing my Android tablet. [Note: not this device]

And then I had the opportunity to use a Surface Book 2, which I'm now reviewing. 15 inch model, Core i5 (so no discrete GPU), 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD, 3000x2000 touch screen. So what's it like?

First, it's heavy. Three and a half pounds, heavier than any laptop I've used for the last 6 years. Which means that it's not going to replace the Surface Go, it's going to spend most of its time on my desk. That's fine; I know that I'm still waiting for the perfect device.*

Second, the screen is gorgeous. Color gamut and brightness are superb, touch registration is unmatched. My previous benchmark was the Huawei MateBook X Pro, and the Surface Book 2 beats it handily (albeit subjectively).

Third, Windows Hello (face-based login) is blindingly fast. I was used to this feature from the Surface Go and my OnePlus 6T phone, but it's almost instantaneous on the Surface Book 2.

Fourth, the build quality is as good as it gets. Which means that it overshadows the latest from Apple, and it's about the same as the Huawei MateBook X Pro. (And NO MORE BUTTERFLY KEYBOARD!!!)

All of the reviews that I've seen have divided the intended audience for the Surface Book 2 into two. The professionals will pay a crazy price to get the Core i7 with the GTX 1060 and 1TB, and they'll have a portable video editing powerhouse with over 12 hours of battery life. The artists won't be able to afford all that, but they'll get the entry-level Surface Book 2 because of the ability to unplug the screen and use it as a tablet with the Surface Pen.

The configuration that I got is aimed at the second group, and I'm not really an artist. So I don't really fit the target audience, and all I can do is to review the unit as a well-built, slightly over-weight business laptop. And It fits that use case surprisingly well. The screen fits nicely just below the big curved monitor on my desk; I run all of my productivity tools on the Surface Book screen, and do my real work on the external monitor. Once or twice a week I flip the screen around into what Microsoft calls ""Studio Mode"", and use the Pen to sketch software architecture diagrams.  The lag is not perfect, but it's acceptable.

Overall, I like it. Great screen, nicely balanced keyboard, decent performance, great usability, excellent battery life.

* Speaking of perfect, if Microsoft would put a decent processor into a Surface Go, bump the RAM to 16GB, and include the LTE modem, while keeping the weight under a pound and a half, they can come and take my money right now.",
"I have been using this laptop for about 6 months, and I am basically happy with it.  The one problem I have had is with the CD/DVD drive: it is extremely finicky to open.  I have to do this slightly frustrating thing where I push the drive further into the computer and then push the open/close toggle with one of my fingers; sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.  (Just pushing on the toggle button without pushing in the drive doesn't work at all.)  Fortunately, I don't have to use the CD/DVD drive very often.  I don't do gaming on this computer; just basic business application stuff. However, I do have a lot of applications open at once, and the amount of RAM seems sufficient for this: the speed/performance is fine.  I am pleased that the touchpad includes separate buttons for left and right click (a previous version of HP computer tried to combine this into the touchpad and it was extremely frustrating and difficult to use).  Overall, it seems like it was a reasonably good computer with a lot of RAM and large hard drive (1.8TB) at a reasonable price ($550).",
"When I first got this laptop, it was everything that I had asked and hoped for. It ran quickly, booted fast, ran the games that I needed it to, took the notes that I needed, the whole nine. It was perfect for what I was doing as a college student. I had it for eight total months before it started to get louder. Then nine before I started receiving messages that the fan was malfunctioning. I took it to my school's IT place and they said it looked like a screw was missing that was holding the fan in place. I don't know anything about it or if the screw was even there since I'm too scared to open up my own laptop. I don't know how to do this stuff and I wasn't going to mess it up more. They cleaned the fan, but they couldn't fix the loud clicking and whirring noise coming from the fan. Now a little further down the line almost 1 year and it's shutting down randomly, taking forever to start up, freezing, won't stay on if it's not connected to a power source, and the clicking is constant and makes it difficult to use the laptop. I can't even take it with me to class anymore to take notes because of it. I won't say not to buy it, because I loved my laptop in the beginning, but be warned that, even brand new, you're probably going to have to replace it within a year or two. However, if you don't just have 600 dollars to burn on a laptop, then pick something else or invest in the warranty. You're going to need it.",
"The fan runs a lot, to make the laptop fast. Just play some music to cover it up. This is a PC you can take to your friends house, but don't forget the cord. This laptop will last a couple hours on battery with light use. The bloatware affects performance slightly, I will likely do a clean install at some point, but its not a major issue.  Now, I don't know why hyper threading is disabled in BIOS OOTB but it is, and I noticed right away when MEmu would not load a single instance, yet once hyper threading was enabled, started right up. Maybe hyper threading is disabled for the same reason the go carts at the theme park are throttled: so nobody gets hurt. Maybe enabling hyper threading will make your laptop melt or light on fire (doubtful). Either way, mine has hyper threading enabled (in BIOS) and it is a fairly ambitious multitask er for any average user. In the 450-550 price range, this feels looks a good deal, on paper.  remember, only 3 USB ports 1 reg 2 SS, no USB C no touchscreen, it comes with a disc drive that MAY come in handy. The laptop does not open fully flat, so be careful. SO, enable hyper threading in BIOS (at your own risk) as in my case I would have been 100% a dissatisfied customer if this laptop couldn't run multiple instances of MEmu to a greater degree than the aging i3  I still use everyday. So don't complain it is slow until you try a clean install with hyper threading enabled. Oh, and the screen is, a laptop screen, i guess. (I assume HDMI out works fine)  its all white washed out compared to my PC monitor. I guess that's how laptop screens all are. I assume. Don't forget to disable all the ""occasionally show tips""  settings in Windows 10 to bring the process usage below 100% when doing nothing (long unfixed Windows 10 bug). When properly configured, this is a fast laptop in the i5 8th Gen arena. So Far So Good",
"Purchased this product because of its high specs combine with what something really important to me, the 810g rating. At a nearly 4k price point with an insurance plan I expected it to be better. It constantly runs at high temps when utilizing the gpu but still functions. The high temps have caused an aesthetic hinge cover to come loose, but still functional, the 4k screen seems to be slowly warping upwards on that side because of it. The battery life with the 4k screen is longer than normal but that still isn't a lot of time away from a charger. The main concern is the lower casing, its too flexible and when showing work to others the touchpad isn't consistently useable due to physical  issues with the bottom housing flexing from its own weight. The whole housing should have been metal and even with the 810g rating, a dent in that bottom case could keep the touchpad from working forever. Repairing the hinge when contacting msi is understandably an out of warranty repair. At its price point  and considering you are paying the 1200$ premium over a gaming laptop with similar hardware specs, the build quality should have been higher.",
"I work at a public middle school, I am also a Linux enthusiast. After playing around with the Chromebooks the school district bought for the students to use during  class, I became really interested in this platform. When I read that the Chrome OS now supports not only Android apps, but Linux apps I decided that I was going to buy a Chromebook.

Overall, this Chromebook works well and I am very pleased. Granted, I did use some Amazon points and a gift card I had received for Christmas so the out of pocket price was significantly lower than the $500+ HP was selling the machine for. In other words, I may not have been so happy had I paid list price.

The Good:
1. The machine looks cool and feels very sturdy.

2. The 64 gigs of hard drive space (not counting the 20 or so gigs taken up by the OS) are aqueduct - most mobile apps are fairly small. Some Linux apps can be a bit large, but provided one does not go wild installing apps the provided hard drive space should suffice.

3. On a related note, Google does give you 100 gigs of storage free for one year. Additionally, I was able to mount my NAS in less time than it took me to write this sentence. So, at least at home, I have more space than I will need to store files.

4. The Chrome OS found my networked HP printer and setting the printer up on the Chromebook was very easy.

5. I don't use Gmail, but Chrome allowed me to ""install"" a web app to my email provider's web interface which works pretty well. Personally, I would rather use a stand alone email app. Using flatpak I was able to set up Evolution. Unfortunately,  I was not able to get Evolution to save my password - retyping the password each and every time I wanted to check mail may be a good security measure, but it gets on my nerves at home so I attempted to install Thunderbird. I received an error that I need a newer version of flatpak to run Thunderbird. The command line option to update flatpak returns the notice that no update is available. I settled on Claws mail which works well. I should make clear that these limitations have nothing to do with this particular machine, but seem to represent the state of the OS and Linux integration at the moment.

The Not So Good:
1. While back-lit, the silver color of the letters on the keyboard make viewing the letters extremely difficult. This would not be a problem were the keyboard to mirror most other laptop keyboards I have used. Something is different and I can't quite put my finger on the problem. What I do notice is that on my desktop PC and my Linux laptop I can type without looking at the keyboard. I consistently hit the wrong keys on the Chromebook.

2. The screen has a lot of glare.

3. The speakers work fairly well when the Chromebook is in the position of a traditional laptop. When you fold the screen over to make a tent for viewing a video, the speaker sound becomes muffled due to the speakers being blocked by the screen. Ear buds solve the problem.

Still, overall, the Chromebook works very well and feels solid. The more I use Google's OS the more convinced I am that this is the future for non-gamers.",
"Its hard to find as good as value as the HP X360 with 8GB Ram. This Chromebook got an ""Honorable Mention"" on a recent Chrome Unboxed 2019 review on YouTube. At just over $400 its tough to beat. The Asus C434 Flip is arguably a better Chromebook but costs $100 more for the same specs. The X360 is really great value.

Either of these two Chromebooks will meet most peoples needs with a solid aluminium build quality, convertible into a tablet. This X360 Chromebook runs the Android Play Store apps well which is what I got it for to be able to run Skype, which it does flawlessly.

The Chromebook does support the new Google Assistant, not that I use it much. I'll talk to a dedicated device, not so much to my laptop/tablet. I'm using Amazon Echo throughout the home so I suppose that's why I don't use the Google Assistant very much.

So glad HP went with a USB-C charging cable. HP sensibly put regular USB ports on the device as well. As with most laptops now, no HDMI port, so to connect to an external device you'll need a dongle. The charging cable is a standard laptop brick, shame they didn't go with a travel charger.

The lettering on the keys is fairly light with low contrast which at certain angles can make it difficult to see which key is which. The back-lighting works well.",
"Unfortunately I'm not sure what's wrong with this laptop but it's not working properly. I let it fully charge for hours and for some reason it still won't turn on I don't really know why. It's a shame because the look of it is super cool.

The pros about this is it has a very decent specs inside, the metal is super high end looking. Just opening the lid up is just it's a really nice experience. The keyboard is not bad I personally prefer the number pads on the side but this is a smaller laptop and there's really no room for it. I feel like they put a lot of effort to make the entire experience nice but for some reason it won't turn on and I don't know why. I'm hoping that it's only me that has this issue because it looks so cool.

I personally am a big fan of name brand laptops so I honestly was trying to give this a try hopefully I can figure out what's wrong and get it working but for now it doesn't turn on at all. I charged it overnight same issue it just won't turn on.",
"Reporting this seller to Amazon in the hopes that this gets fixed. I bought this laptop for a friend to study in college with, SPECIFICALLY because of the balanced specs and Windows 11 Home as listed, then waited a week for it to arrive at his house in a different time zone. The dang machine shows up with Windows 10 S installed. That's a solid hundred bucks I'm being ripped off for, I really could've just bought a laptop at Walmart and had a better experience than waiting a week to get an effectively defective machine. This laptop is for a really good friend of mine, my personal machines are all custom builds of some kind or another because i work in tech and music, and i wish I'd just rebuilt a pawn shop computer instead of losing money on this.

Really, just list the right version of windows in your product description, it's hardly 3 letters of effort but the user experience is dramatically different, please get this right",
"This was for my 71 year old dad with 1 bad eye. In chrome OS you can't put icons on the actual desktop. You must slide the taskbar up, or tap a button. You can't put links to websites like I did for him on windows with a good description of each. You can't set it to log on without prompting for a password, which for him is almost a deal breaker. I had to guide him to type his password in if websites forgot it. To do it every time would be murder for him.

Those things I could talk him through, if he never got used to the convenience of windows. But here's what happened the first hour of use to me setting it up for him, checking all things out. In YouTube a video was playing, I was trying to delete some old bookmarks. The whole thing froze, no response, sound of the video was like a broken record. Then after 100 presses of power it did shut off. When back on, no sound. Had to reboot it to get the sound back. This is the first hour, of the first day. Be sure you all know what these are. Limited, clearly less stable than windows. Android, but not Android. I got a launcher, but couldn't link sites to it, or make it my main desktop. Facebook Android app wouldn't load, though in chrome it works fine. Just know this everyone, it's not as good as Windows, I don't care what anyone says.",
"This review is for HP Chromebook 14""  14-ca040nr.  The display resolution is really awesome. I like that the USB-C power/data ports  are  located on both the left and right hand side of the unit! So you can plug it in from ether side.
 This unit does have  left and right stereo speakers  mounted directly below the screen. The B&O sound system is nice I guess, hope your are not buying any Chromebook anticipating awesome sound quality.
This was purchased to replace an Acer model 720 which I have used for 5 years.  The user interface is nearly identical. My Acer suffered from battery bulging as I left it plugged in all the time. No laptop especially ones with non-replaceable batteries should be left continuously plugged  in to an AC outlet.
I really like to have a Chromebook around usually use by bedside, also when my Windows desktop is under going a 3 hour update right when I really need to get something done.
The  price on this model changes daily I paid  $299 the next day it was selling for 259. Rats... oh well it's nice and I was scared to recharge my old Acer with the battery issue.",
"I can't stand Windows OS anymore. To damn controlling and the forced updates that mess things up and always when i start it up because i don't use it much anymore so i might as well pour a cup of coffee and sit down for a while. Google is questionable as to how android is going, so i figured it would try a cheap chromebook. I do not care for the operating system at all. So stripped down, and everything software side sucks. have to get root access to be able to have reasonable access to file system, mouse support is crappy, and i will stop cause i could go on for awhile. Guess it is good if you only want mail and internet access. Have to hope you can  find an extension or app on the chrome store.
update 12/7/18: i really really don't like Chrome OS. Access to the app drawer is a move your mouse around to get to the drawer with two clicks instead of opening by clicking on the drawer button.  Finding files is a hit and miss deal. I installed a video downloader and only the app finds the files. Does not show in the Chrome file app, nor in the ONLY app for this in the chrome app store. Shouldn't have to go to Play store to find such a common app. Need to root to get access to files and that erases all your data on the chromebook. Updated this morning, and it took about 15 minutes before it would restart. I was freaking out that my new laptop was dead. Some warning upfront that it would take that long would be nice. That is one of the reasons I wanted to get away from Windows, and now it is starting to be the same with Chrome. So unhappy with Alphabet/Google. Maybe i need to start considering Apple.....",
"We've had three different ""budget"" Chromebooks, the Acer C720, Acer Chromebook 14 and this HP Chromebook 14 G5.  Of the three, the C720 has lasted the longest. We have young kids who are hard on the machines and only the C720 lasted.

This one only lasted one year. The trackpad is caput. It felt sturdy and of similar build quality to the C720 but ultimately it couldn't stand the test of time. Even the Acer 14 seemed to be more fragile despite it's aluminum body but that one we got two solid years of use out of.

I have to say we're disappointed with the longevity of the HP 14 G5. I was hoping it could permanently replace the C720 but it didn't.

If you don't have young kids who abuse your electronics then this is probably a fine option. It had the juice to run Android apps and we never felt it was underpowered for general web surfing, Google Docs or remoting into a work desktop with Google's remote access tool. I'm sure if it were better cared for it would have lasted much longer.",
"This review is for the NON-touch screen 14-ca040nr.  Reviews get lumped together, so it's good to know which product you're reading about.

I'm a semi-retired IT technician, so this review comes from that standpoint.

If you're not familiar with the Chrome operating system you may want to do some independent research before purchasing a Chromebook.  While they are designed around Cloud computing (with most data being saved in Google Docs rather than locally), it's quite possible to work with the machine offline.  You can specify in Google Docs that files should be available ""offline""; a copy of the file is kept locally and syncs back to the Cloud when WiFi becomes available.

Google Docs (word processor, spreadsheet, presentation software) all come with your Gmail account and is the ""base"" set of applications used by most folks on a Chromebook.

I've enabled Linux on the HP, and installed LibreOffice - primarily because there's no database application in Google Docs and I do a bit of work in databases.  Linux works very well on the HP for that purpose.

Linux also allows the installation of GIMP, which is a PhotoShop type image editor.

[EDIT 9/30/18 - I should note that Linux documents (such as you may create in LibreOffice) should be kept within the Linux folder structure.  Keeping such files on an SD drive doesn't work - Linux can't ""see"" that drive.  There may be a method to guide Linux to the proper folder.  If I take time to figure that out I'll update the review.  In the interim, plan on using a bit of the 32gb of internal space for LibreOffice docs.  The upside is that, of course, such documents are totally independent of the Cloud, just like they would be on a Windows machine).

I've enabled File System For Windows (another app) which allows me to contact to my Windows 10 Pro machine and transfer files to and from while on the same network.  Chrome RDP allows me to take control of the Windows machine while on the same network and Chrome Remote Desktop allows access to the Windows machine from wherever there is an Internet connection (without direct file transfer - if you need to swap a file, just drop it into Google Drive).

If you're a DropBox user, you can install File System for DropBox on the Chromebook.

Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, OneDrive, Outlook, etc. are all available from the Microsoft web applications.  Microsoft Access is not available on the web apps.  There are also Android apps for Microsoft (which I don't use, I use the web apps).  If you have encrypted Word or Excel files the M/S web apps can't open them.  You can install the (free) WPS office suite and it can open password locked Microsoft documents just fine.  If you enable Linux, LibreOffice can also open encrypted Microsoft documents.

Splashtop for Business works using their web app, and from that I can log into remote Windows machines (including  Windows Server 12r2).

As you can see, quite a bit of work can be done using a Chromebook - it all depends upon your needs and the setup.

The HP has a decent, but not great, keyboard.  Battery life is excellent.  Be advised - there's no dedicated ""delete"" key or ""caps lock"" key.  You can remap the ""search"" key to emulate a ""caps lock"" key but that affects cursor movement if you're working in Google Docs.  If you haven't used a Chromebook before, Google for how the keyboard works.  Takes a little getting used to, but it's doable.

There's a micro-SD card slot (I'm using a 32gb card, but it will accept larger cards if need be).  Remember that, while Chromebooks are fairly secure, the card is not encrypted by default.  There are encryption apps available for locking down the SD card.

The screen (the non-touch version) is O.K.; it doesn't come close to the Pixel screen but it costs only 1/4 as much as a Pixel.

The charger (included) plugs into either of two USB C ports - one on each side of the machine.  The machine also offers two USB A ports.

The touch-pad is good - it doesn't get in the way when typing.  However the ""mouse clicks"" on the pad are 'way too hard and loud.  In a library setting it would become annoying very quickly.  Better to use the 'double tap' on the touch-pad rather than click the corners.

The speakers, for this size of machine in this price range, are excellent.  (I'm not an audiophile, but they sound pretty good to me).  Unlike many lower priced units the speakers are on the Chromebook surface, not underneath or to the sides.  [EDIT 9/30/18 - Using the on board Bluetooth I was able to successfully ""pair"" the HP with an Amazon Echo.  Playing .MP3 files from the SD card using the on board Audio app works fine.]

Printing is still a bit of an issue with Chromebooks - if you've not used Chromebooks before, do some research on printing lest you be surprised.  Remember that Chromebooks don't accept "".exe"" programs (so you can't load M/S Office from a DVD) and you can't load printer drivers (there are work-arounds but you'll have to look 'em up on your own).  Google Cloud Print is supported.  Still, most printers aren't 'plug 'n play' by simply plugging in a USB cable.  I'm printing to a Samsung, a Kodak 7.1, and an old HP4050n which is hooked up to a Windows 10 machine via Ethernet.  It may take a little more effort than you're used to with ""plug 'n play"" Windows.

There's no Ethernet port on the machine, but you can get adapters that use the USB C ports and have Ethernet connections.  Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are, of course, supported by default.

The power switch is above the ""backspace"" key and not likely to be hit accidentally - an improvement over my last Chromebook.

One note on Cloud storage - Google offers a 100gb ""free"" upgrade for two years (after that if you use more than the 15gb that comes with a Gmail account you have to start paying).  You can Google that - but be aware that if you have multiple Chromebooks (as I do) assigned to one Gmail account, you can't ""stack"" or extend the 100gb offer.  It's 100gb total for each account.  IMHO Google should change their policy on this and, if a new device is purchased for the existing account, the 100gb offer should be extended from the new date of purchase.  YMMV.

YouTube videos seem to play well - I don't play games or watch Netflix on the machine, it's more of a workhorse for me.

Out of the 32gb total internal storage, after Linux and all other apps that I use are installed, I have 18gb free space (not including the SD card).

Fit and finish is good (although the machine is basically plastic) and it weighs about 3 pounds (again, the non-touch screen version).  It is, for me, a true ""laptop"" machine in that the bottom doesn't get too hot to hold when it's in my lap.

Overall I'm really pleased with the HP 14-ca040nr.  I've read reviews that say that Chromebooks don't work offline, or don't offer software - and those reviews are wrong.  You just have to set the machine up properly.

HTH

"A month in with this tablet and I'm generally really happy with it. Samsung's Android skin is extremely smooth, adds function without clouding the Android experience. Hardware powers through websites and apps without a second thought. The screen is gorgeous, deep colors and crisp blacks. Its difficult to look at my new LG G4 phone after looking at this screen; it just pales in comparison.

Big gripe, though: the battery on this thing... well, it sucks. Its really bad. It will not last more than a 3-4 hours of a lazy afternoon's heavy use (browsing imgur, a video here / there, web browsing). I have to turn it off whenever I'm not using it, otherwise it has to be tethered to it's charger.

Lastly, the thumb print scanner is not functional. Not worth the headache of setting it up. It fails no matter how carefully you replicate your initial placement. Would be nice to have an update where it continued to learn your print in the future, to make the scan more efficient.

All said and done, this is very likely the best Android tablet on the market.... for now. Google's Pixel C tablet comes out soon and I need to figure out a way to swap this Samsung for that new beast.",
"Okay, its not a big secret that I am fans of the Samsung tablet lines. The screen looks great when I look at my pictures, there is no complaint there, the 4-3 ratio is a little bit weird unless you are a reader than it will work out well for you. Watching HD movies is not a bad thing, but you will notice that there is some wasted space. Apps, now when you star your device there are a bunch of choices to pick from. Yes there is pre installed software but most of it was things i was going to use anyways. there are two app stores to chose from but i normally just use the google one. The cameras, while not the best, I find that I dont normal use the cameras for much more than when I am video chatting with friends. I find that I normally use the tablet for a few hours at a time but never have to plug in unless I am going to sleep. I dont have battery issues so i guess I got lucky. The storage is never an issue bc you have the 32 or 64 gig and than you also have the option to add an SD card too.
All in all I find myself enjoying my new tablet and turned the slower one into a media device. Its worth the upgrade and if you are thinking about this one and wondering, Yes this is worth it.",
"If you are looking for a tablet and not obsessed with getting an iPad look no further!  I am very familiar with both iOS products and Android products.  I have owned a Nexus 7, Galaxy S5, Galaxy S4, Nexus 5, Nexus 7, iPhone 6, and iPad Air 2.  The Android products are what I choose to use at home and for personal use.

I debated for a long time between getting an Android tablet or a new iPad for my own personal use.  Based on my experience with Android devices, especially Samsung devices, I was concerned that the user experience and operating system would not be smooth.  My Galaxy S5 and S4 both experienced glitches and flaws that would sometimes frustrate me.  But Apple products are just so much more expensive and not easily customizable.  When Black Friday rolled around I was able to snatch up this tablet for $340; if the product turned out to be a dud I could always return it using Amazon's excellent return policy.

I don't know what Samsung did to resolve their issues but this tablet operates very smoothly; much better than my previous experience with their devices.  First there is absolutely no lag when swiping or loading apps; everything transitions smoothly and provides the kind of experience you would expect from an iOS device.  Secondly the device is very thin and extremely appealing; I chose to get the white version.  The battery life is excellent, I watched 6 hours of Netflix and still had plenty of battery life left.  Thirdly it is very customizable which is of course one of the primary reasons users choose Android in the first place.

You should get this device if you are on the market for a tablet and not obsessed with the idea of owning an Apple device.  I have a hard time imagining a better tablet on the market right now and especially for the price point.",
"I LOVE, no, I ADORE AMAZON.  Their customer service is EXCELLENT!!!!

First, let me say that I adore this tablet! The clarity in picture, and functions are amazing. I have been super happy with this product. I did A LOT of research before finally deciding on The Samsung Gallaxy Tab S2 with a 9.7"" screen and have not been disappointed with the performance of the tablet except for one thing...The charging port. I don't know if I got a defective port, or if this is a weak point for this product, we shall see.

I purchased this tablet about a year prior to the problems with the port. At the same time I purchased the tablet, I did purchase a two year protection plan through Square Trade for $40. Unfortunately, the warranty through Square Trade would not kick in until after the Samsung warranty ran out. I spent a very frustrating morning looking for HELP through Samsung regarding their warranty on the tablet and what to do when something went wrong with it. I found NOTHING. I looked online, made a few phone calls that lead no where. I thought it would be so easy, but it wasn't. Samsung needs to fix this. If you're going to offer a warranty that comes with your product, include information with the product so a customer may follow through with help in the event there is a problem. The information included with the tablet, gave me nothing but dead ends. I called the numbers in the booklet, and the numbers were not up to date and with no help whatsoever to resolve the issue.

My partner could see my frustration. I wasted time, and energy leading to dead ends, and he suggested I call Amazon for help. I thought there was no way Amazon would be able to help because it was an issue with the warranty through Samsung. NOT TRUE. Not only was my problem SOLVED, but Amazon sent me a REPLACEMENT tablet in TWO DAYS and gave me 30 days to send the tablet with the defective port back!

AMAZON STANDS BY THEIR PRODUCTS. GIVES THE MOST AMAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE SO THE ***CUSTOMER*** IS HAPPY WITH THEIR PURCHASE AND CAN PURCHASE WITH UTTER CONFIDENCE!!!!

I would NOT want to purchase items ANYWHERE ELSE if I can purchase them though AMAZON. I ALWAYS check Amazon FIRST before I purchase ANYTHING. The prices are competitive, the customer service is OUTSTANDING and without a doubt STELLAR!

Thank you AMAZON for turning around a very frustrating situation into an experience that ended up being RESOLVED painlessly. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!!!!",
"Pros:
1. Very lightweight and comfortable to hold.
2. Great screen.
3. 4:3 screen ratio is so much more comfortable than 16:10 or 16:9 I used previously on tablets.
4. Very fast.

Cons:
1. No notification light. That's very surprising move from Samsung. Why remove it?
2. MicroUSB port is located far to the right, so it is highly unlikely there will be a charging cradle/holder for this tablet. Or it will be made specifically for this tablet and useless for all other devices because of weird location.
3. Headphone jack is located on the bottom just like on the phones like Samsung Galaxy S6, but it is great for phones and not so great for the tablets, especially this one as it will be used vertically most of the time... I wish it was on top like on iPads.
4. 3 physical buttons are not easy to use when using tablet horizontally. I wish there was an option to turn virtual buttons (app switch, home, back) in this mode.
5. No wireless charging. Small weight is nice but wireless charging at expense of some weight would be amazing.
6. Require case because of the camera unit.",
"Before I purchased this tablet, I owned the Tab A 9.7 and loved it, except the lower resolution. Finally, I decided to step up and upgrade to the Tab2 S 9.7 and I am so glad I did as I state the reasons why below:

PROS/SPECIAL FEATURES...

+ Size/Weight/Ease oh holding this S2 9.7 - I had the Tab A 9.7 and before that Tab4 10.1. Both of my old tablets were THICKER and heavier compared to the S2. This tablet is feather light for a 9.7 and more comfortable to hold and to carry in my purse or backpack.

Screen Resolution, Brightness and Other Info – The resolution on this is 264 ppi compared to 132 ppi (pixels per inch) of Tab A 9.7. This is more than double the resolution. And note that the colors, pictures, videos, everything is so sharp and clear. The screen just pops with color! And I find it easy to read eBooks, watch videos, etc on this tablet. Even at a higher price for this tablet, I find that the tablet has been a wonderful purchase.

* The screen aspect ratio is 4:3 vs the 16:1 type of screen. For me, I like this 4:3 screen because I found that the webpages are easier to read and clearer, I did not have to scroll to the right. Also I found that the pictures on a website were easier to view. I compared this tablet with my older Tab 4 10.1 tablet on my frequent webpages and while I viewed this tablet, I could read the larger text better, read my eBooks much clearer, emails better etc. This is my personal discovery from my testing of this and comparing it to my older tablet.

+ Battery life/Speed – Good battery life, but not quite as good as my oldercaTab4 or TabA. For me, I have found that I am constantly on WiFi (Internet). One of the reasons is the screen is noticeably brighter (Tab S2 has more brightness nits). So I had to lower the brightness.
The tablet I find is quite responsive and peppy with no lagging. The Lollipop 5.1.1 runs this tablet wonderfully.

 WiFi Connecting/Speed of WiFi and MORE - This tablet connects SUPER quickly to my home WiFi and has never ever dropped the WIFi signal no matter where I am in my home. WiFi is VERY STRONG at 144mbps, vs 72mbps on my other tablets. Also, my internet loads super, super fast in all browsers that I tried.. And even when I am far from my router I still have 4.5 bars! I went to Settings, pressed on WiFi and it showed speed on my tablets. A,lso, to test this WiFi and compare it to my other Android devices, I went to the Playstore and got the free app called WiFi Analyzer. This is a MUST HAVE app for any Android device as it gives you a visual report on the WiFi strength of your tablet, phone etc.The Wifi speed on my Tab S2 is near double of what my TabA had.
Also, there is 32GB Ram in the Tab S2, this is double Ram of Tab A or Tab 4. And this tablet is super fast, no lagging at all!

+ SPECIAL INFO about INTERNET CONNECTION - Yes, this is a WiFi only, but when you are away from an WiFi internet hotspot location, there are ways to can get onto the internet such as MiFi and there are ways that you can purchase equipment so that you can have data when you do not have a WiFi hotspot available.

+ Internet & Webpage & Video Viewing - The stock browser does a wonderful job and it opens up webpages very fast. Also I tried Maxthon Browser and this worked very well yet I still prefer the Internet App. Also, I tried out the factory installed Chrome Browser and liked it OK, yet again, I went back the the stock Internet App (this is my preference). Note that the Playstore has many very good (FREE) internet browsers as Dolphin, Opera and many more!

+ EXTERNAL SLOT FOR MICRO SD CARD/Internal Storage. This is a must for me as I keep my personal files, photos, and music on my internal SD card. I installed a SanDisk 64GB SD card and it works great on this tablet and I placed my music and files on it and have plenty of space left. This tablet accepts up to 128GB SD card.
The internal storage of 32GB is double of my Tab A 9.7 or Tab 4 10.1 that have 16GB. Even after Android OS, factory apps, Facebook, Twitter, Kindle App and many more personal that I installed, I still have  just at 23GB of internal storage left!

- + Camera / Video Camera - This has a camera of 8MP with no flash on this camera, however, in good lighting the pictures came out much better had I expected. However, I rarely use this camera as I prefer to use my Nikon digital camera for my overall picture taking...the camera on this tablet is OK for backup camera, taking pictures to send in an email, etc). Do not expect the camera on this tablet to replace your digital camera since it does not have a flash.

+ Home Videos - The stock video player is OK and plays MOST home videos, however, may I suggest QQ Player (Free App from Playstore and the ONLY one I recommend as it plays every home video I tried)..

+ Music Player/Sound Quality - This model has the regular MUSIC App, which plays by playlists, songs, albums and even folders. Also there is Google Music app is pre-installed in this tablet and does a fine job. However, I installed the FREE app called Rocket Player from the Playstore and love this music player! As for sound quality - The best way to really enjoy music is through a high quality Bluetooth speaker or Bluetooth headset as the sound quality is superb this way and you can walk about your home listening to your music!

+ OTG USB Compatible - This tablet comes with a free OTG On the Go adapter cable. Just plug in your flash drive and you can copy files to the flash drive so easily or view files that are on the flash drive. *Note that portable external hard drives and portable DVD/CD drives will not work using OTG in this tablet because they require a lot of power.

CONS:
-  Battery life is so-so, not the best out there. In fact, I had close to 2 hours less per day on the Tab S2 over the Tab A!  But this is not a deal breaker for me as I still have enough battery time, and I always keep a spare charger in car/purse.

- Cost is pricey compared to Tab A line or the Tab 4 line. The price difference us about 100 dollars more for the Tab S2 9.7, however, for me, I believe that I received a very high end tablet, so it was worth what I paid.

Bottom line- Yes, this is a pricey tablet, however, I believe that the old saying that you get what you pay for is true. This is a very high quality tablet.

Should you buy this or the Tab A or a less expensive tablet in my opinion?  While this is an exceptional tablet, I also recommend a couple of others below....

TAB S2 ... Yes you may want to consider the Tab S2 9.7 if you want a higher resolution tablet with larger Internal space, 8MP camera and other high end features and you do not mind paying about 100 dollars more for higher end features etc.

TAB A 9.7... Yes if you want a good tablet for a reasonable price and do not mind lower resolution or 16GB Internal, 5 MP camera, etc, yet this is good because the battery lasted me 2 more hours daily than Tab S2. The TAB A is a wonderful tablet for the money) or Tab 4 10.1, or other lower priced tablet. A 5 MP camera us OK on a tablet for emergency pictures, 16GB Internal is OK if you watch how many apps you install on the internal storage.
Also, the Tab A is a GREAT BUY and excellent for someone new to tablets.

If you have questions, ask me in comments. I am kind of a techie person and will answer promptly.

Thank you for reading my review.",
"First: The included charger was very small and the first screen I saw when I turned it on tells me ""You have plugged in a lower wattage power adapter. Your system will continue to work, but may not perform at its peak."" Really? $700 for a refurb and you cannot even send the proper charger? So I continue with the first boot and choose region and keyboard as usual then am greeted with a screen asking me for my Booking.com email address. What? I do not even know what booking.com is and there is no way to bypass this screen. See attached photos. The first screen informing me of the too small power adapter also had the Dell Service Tag number so I went to Dell to look that up. Turns out this service tag number has Dell ProSupport Plus until 25 September 2024. Wow. That seems too good to be true but I learned the machine needs a 65W adapter and you can see in the last photo the included adpater is only 45W. I might forgive the 45W adapter but I have never had a new Windows 10 machine ask me for my Booking.com email address upon the first boot. I cannot imagine what other surprises would await if I knew how to bypass that screen.

Update 9/29/2023: Thank goodness for Dell support. I was able to download and install the factory image from Dell so this laptop now appears to be okay and usable. I have no idea what the refurbish company had put on this machine but it was not a clean windows 10 pro image. HQCapital support has been very responsive (+1star) and is sending the correct charger for this machine.",
"I'm a Mac person. iPhone, iPad, iMac, Macbook.  I'm taking a class in cloud computing and we are working on Google drive.  I thought I'd buy an android device.  I thought android would be more compatible with all the google apps.

This Tab3 is really clunky.  I found it s-l-o-w.  While supposedly running a 1.2gb processor and 8gb flash memory and 1gb memory.  It became really annoying while trying to open an app, then it would automatically close.

I tried to load some music on it.  I found on Youtube, a suggestion to connect it as an external drive than upload.  I unloaded one album, but could never find the music.  Another suggestion was to download an app called 'Kies' -  Kies asks if I wanted ALL my music, and i checked 'NO' I then downloaded one album, when I opened my Galaxy Tab3, I couldn't find the music, but i did find my entire iPhoto library.

Trying to delete my photos was impossible, unless I deleted them one at a time.  I had over 4,000 photos uploaded.

Finally getting so frustrated, I wiped it, reset to original condition, repacked it and sent it back to Amazon.",
"I've had this tablet for four months, and barely have the energy to try to use it. To wake it up, I have to press the button repeatedly, or even try the power button. Eventually it does turn on, and that's when the challenge begins.

Most times I am trying to watch a video, the tablet freezes and makes a maddening noise. The only way I was able to stop it was by trying to turn it off repeatedly, since I couldn't figure out how to open it and remove the battery.

Typing anything when browsing the internet is a challenge. I press a letter and it takes a few seconds for the letter to be entered. And it freezes or opens other pages when I simply get my finger too close too a link. If I try the back button, it usually doesn't work or simply kicks me out of the internet.

I should clarify that I have not overloaded my tablet with apps. The internal memory has more than half left. Samsung support suggested I clear my internet apps completely, but this didn't work. I simply hate this product and will have to try to get it replaced or just throw it out the window.",
"I did what I thought was a good deal of research before buying this. Unfortunately, none of the review articles (and certainly not the Samsung site) will let you know that this device will not work with many of the accessories. Most important is the lack of an HDMI connection via MHL/micro-USB port (I also wasn't able to get any of the micro USB to USB connectors to work with this device and couldn't get the Peel remote to control the TV). I didn't find this out until I had already bought a MHL/micro-USB to HDMI connection and tried to get it to work. Don't bother, it wont. If you want to attempt to connect this device to a television, there is no good way that I can think of. Apparently the 8 and 10.1 models have this capability. Nothing on the Amazon or Samsung websites point out this discrepancy. Even the older (Tab 2 models) can be connected via a dock, not the Tab 3 7-inch though. Returning my 7 inch tablet as a result.",
"I love the galaxy s4 and galaxy tab 10.1.  So I thought the 7.0 tab would work well for my 9 year old daughter.  This tab was a disappointment.  Problems included random crashes, sluggishness,  and the datetime would reset everytime the device was restarted.  Loading web pages was very slow... so were games.

I was planning on returning to amazon, but decided to do a little troubleshooting first, which included: factory reset, clearing the device cache, turning off extra features like the lock screen, power saving (which limited CPU), auto updates, and widgets.

I also discovered a flaw in the plastic around the on/off switch.  It was sticking ""on"" sometimes, causing the device to randomly reboot.

It's working better now.  As for quality, it's ok now but not in the same league as the other galaxy devices.  I'd say a better price should be $125.  I wouldn't recommend if you pay more than that.  Spend a little extra and get a better tab.  I wish we had gotten a nexus or another galaxy tab 3 10.1, given that I had to spend at least 4 hours troubleshooting the device.",
"So I got 2 of these (8gb model) for my kids for christmas this year.  By the day after Christmas one of them was already completely out of internal memory after downloading less than 20 apps / games.  That is because over 4gb is used for the OS and other bloatware that cant be removed.  So that leaves less than 4 gb left for apps, photos, videos, etc which goes pretty fast.  My sone had 1 game that was taking up over 1Gb. Now, I thought the external SD card would solve our issue so I went out and got a 16gb card.  That's when I found out Samsung disables the option to install / move apps onto the external SD card. It's only for photos and video which doesn't help the apps problem. So 2 days after turning it on for the first time, we're already into deleting apps to make space mode. Given the price, there are other tablets that offer a better value in my opinion.

Overall a decent tablet otherwise. I would rate higher if Samsung would remove the restriction on putting apps on the SD card.  Other vendors android based tablets allow this.",
"I have owned and used many Samsung products and have been happy with all of them in the past.  I wanted an affordable and reliable android tablet for around the house to replace an Original Kindle Fire,  so I purchased the Galaxy Tab 3.

After I received the Galaxy Tab 3 and started using it,  I noticed how sluggish the interface was in comparison to other devices that I have used such as the Kindle Fire HD and the iPad Mini.  It also did not feel as ""solid"" as some other the other devices I was used to.  Under normal use such as web browsing or streaming movies, it got hot to the touch.  I also had to frequently reboot the unit to keep it responsive.

Unfortunately, After about a month after purchase, the unit locked up and shut down to a black screen.  It would not come back on after that.  I have had to send it back for warranty repair and am anxiously awaiting the results of the repair.

Other Samsung tablets may be better and may be worth the money.  However, I can not recommend this unit.",
"Ok so 8gb isn't enough for me, after awhile the lack of space slows the hardware down (as with most things)

I brought this for myself as a belated birthday present
The operating system is great runs smooth and vividly.
My favorite feature is the S Voice (It's samsung's version of Siri), just wish there was an option to make it masculine.

It charges fast which I really like and it lasts long. Normally I would unplug it around 11am and won't plug it back in until 4-6am , with extensive use.

Skype does run the battery down a bit.
So far the power saver feature causes freezing with facebook messenger and skype.

It's great for spanish lessons and bookclub reading

Just brought my mum one for my birthday yesterday this way she could watch her favorite shows on the go.
No real problems, other than memory but that is a simple fix. Microsd cards go on sale around back to school deals.

Try it out and see for yourself, it's a great tab for a great price.

p.s. you can control the font size so there's no true ""size"" problem.",
"I ordered this tablet the 5th of July and got it the 7th as promised (it was a Prime product). I however ordered the tablet in the gold-brown colour, but received it in the midnight black colour; I couldn't be bothered to return it. The features have been cool and have been as described thus far, however, I did note that when this tablet was compared amongst its larger versions (the 8.0 and the 10.1), the box that lists that it has the multi-window feature, was left blank. I'm not sure if that's true for every 7.0 model, but the one I received does indeed have the multi-window feature. Both cameras take pretty decent pictures. Only one little weird design with the tablet: the volume buttons do not operate in the manner you'd expect them to; to turn the volume up, you'll have to press the conventional 'down' side of the button and vice versa.
Overall, I'm pleased with the tablet and will be posting pictures if I can.",
"Tablet tethers to my cell, and it is rocket fast on the web.  Overall?  For under 200 bucks delivered  to my door not bad!!  2 weeks into use...HUGE  problem...the headphone jack went silent...started making a clicking sound only...now no sound!!  A common problem with the product based on my research.  You can go to wireless headphones...but me personally...I like hard wire so...I guess more EMF for my brain.?

Positives:  No lag in key strokes, price is good... I like Samsung personally, graphics are clean, have'nt experienced pixilated screen with streaming video, size is perfect, SD card slot, more freedom than Apple products.  Again, you get your money's worth with Samsung.

Negatives:  I believe a common manufacturing error has occurred with the headphone jack, as it started right out of the box and progressed to clicking alternating with working fine to now no audio at all from headphone jack.  Camera is not up to par with most Samsung cell phones from the same generation.

I  will stay with the Samsung tablet due to freedom of controlling data etc...hopefully the next gen tab has a better camera megapixel like the S4...AND the headphone jack manufacture improves.",
This tablet is good. Almost perfect size. Good size screen but still can fit in some large pockets. The stock memory of 8gb can be filled quick because some games can be 1gb in size. But the memory can be expanded easily and not for too much. Performance is good. I am still surprised by the graphics of some games. I just wish I could get or find a gimp or photoshop like app to do graphic designs on the go without having to root or basically hack the tablet. The wifi range is good if you are within your home or the same building as the router but it can get weak when  you are outside. I am looking for a way to boost its signal by maybe using an usb wifi adapter for rasberrry pi like boards and use a usb to micro usb adapter to connect it to the tablet. Should work since rasberry pi uses android and linux like this can but this tablet has to be hacked to root it so you can install linux while it comes with android out of box. I would recommend and buy this tablet again. Battery is about 12 hours with wifi off but with wifi on it can be drained in about 6 hours if you surf the net alot and can be drained even quicker if playing a game with 3d graphics while wifi is on. But with all the usb power adapters on the market I doubt that will be much of a problem for most people. I have two wall power adapters and one car adapter while only spending about 40 us dollars so i can not complain too much about having enough power for my needs.,
"Received the tablet just the other day and being my first tablet, it took a slight amount of  break in time.
The size is just right for me and I am glad I did not buy anything larger as easy and light portability was part of my buying decision.  The color quality far exceeded my expectations.  Played a newscast from NBC and it was almost as good as watching my HD TV. It is a fast device with a logical interface that provides smooth connections to the internet.

I am impressed by how fast the start up and power off works..........literally a few seconds to connect or disconnect.  The keyboard is user friendly and if you purchase the optional 64gb micro sd card, you should plenty of storage space for smaller sized photos.  Apps are also downloaded with above average speed and work very well.

On the downside:

Strength of Wi-Fi signal is reduced sometimes but not really a big issue as it usually shows full waves but when it falters I lose only one of them........still a reliable connection, although my laptop and notebook are 100% in the same area which is about three rooms away from the router.  When the tab is in the same room (or next room) as router it performs 100%.

I know I can buy the screen protector (and I will), but fingerprints get piled up on the glossy screen quite fast.  So for now I wipe the screen with a good cleaning cloth designed for computer screens.

Lastly, I would rate the battery life as underperforming..........2-3 hours if high power is used.  Of course, you can adjust power in settings to save battery power.

Other than these minor shortcomings, I feel that you are getting an excellent valued product for $199.  Don't think you will be disappointed at all.",
"First of all, this is a decent tab.  I like it for what I use it for.  Value wise, it is a 'great success.'  I use it as my car navigation/radio device.  First thing I did was root it (XDA developers is AWESOME).  I left the stock rom on there, but needed root access for the Tasker app to be able to do all the things I wanted it to do.  I use an Akron dash holder to keep it mounted in my car.  When I power on the car, it boots Pandora, Waze, and other apps I want open while driving.  This thing spends 98% of it's time on my dash.  It does all these tasks admirably.  I have no idea how well it will do in the Utah summer heat though.  This is the WiFi model, I use WiFi hotspot from my phone for data while driving.

Pros:
- Bright screen with decent resolution
- Battery life is quite long (even though it is always plugged in while driving)
- It's Android rooted, so you can do whatever you want if you know what you are doing
- Audio is sufficiently loud (I normally have the headphones plugged in to my aux while driving but sound is good)

Cons:
- Doesn't do great in the cold, even though I can't expect that; if it's cold, prepare for cold warnings and no charging, sluggish LCD refresh.
- Menu/Back buttons don't light up on this 7"" model, sucks when night driving while trying to use it
- Camera might as well not even be there, it has terrible resolution and horrible color.  Don't plan on using it for any reason.

Overall, for a dash rider, it rocks.  Using Waze, Torque app for car data, Pandora or whatever music app you like, and Tasker seals the whole deal.  This app has a medium learning curve, but once you master it, you can make you phone do just about whatever you can imagine automatically.  8/10 would buy again.  Good for kids too at home with the WiFi.  If it breaks, oh well.  Not $500 bucks down the drain like an Ipad if it gets broken.  This thing has 200% more VALUE dollar for dollar over the Ipad.",
"I did a lot of research before choosing to buy a tablet to use as an e-reader, and chose this one because of its size, price, and the fact I've always been very happy with Samsung products. The expandable memory allows a MicroSD card to expand the memory from the default 8GB for significantly less than it would cost to buy an e-reader or tablet with those same internal specs. The height and width dimensions are roughly the same as a mass-market paperback and are perfect for carrying it around on a daily basis and fitting in my purse.

The Android OS lets me install all the apps I need for what I read. Along with several news and magazine apps, I use reading apps for Kindle, Nook, Aldiko, and Kobo, and I'm confident I'll be able to find whatever else I'll need in the future to consolidate all my e-books in one place. Each app operates independently, so I can download reading material directly from the internet to the app or device or update my libraries with what I purchase using a computer or other device. The Dropbox app makes a good middleman for getting free books from Project Gutenberg or documents from other sources to Aldiko.

The way the tablet is set up physically makes it perfect for e-reading. There is a button on the lower left which gives different options based on the app being used, and the back button on the lower right toggles you back from the book to the library. To use the Kindle and Nook apps as examples, once the apps are up and running, you would not know you were on an Android tablet and not on a dedicated Kindle or Nook device.

Of course, there are other perks to having a tablet, including being able to hook up to free wifi for internet browsing and email, games, Google maps, music, weather, other cool Android apps (which are very similar, if not identical, to iOS apps), widgets, and the front/back camera. The screen has the option for automatic brightness adjustment, so you're not always fiddling in the settings to make it comfortable to see.",
I've had this tablet for about 2 weeks now... and its like my sidekick.you know how we didnt have cell phones years ago now you have to turn around and go back home to get it cause you just have to have it.this tablet is with me like the pacifier is with a baby. whenever im ready to go I slip it in my purse grab the power cord and im off.love the wifi. so many businesses have free wifi from the eateries I frequent to my grocery store or the car repair spot. I go to town on this thing.i can read pdf excel powerpoint presentations you have a world of apps.i dont know where this thing can go wrong. Im very careful about what I download if I dont use it its deleted.i havent saved much just still seeing how much it can manage.i did say before I started saving pictures & books I would get a micro sd card. the storage is expandable to I believe 64 gb.i can say so far the camera quality is a little ify.it may be one of those where you need bright light and a close up. Will test that more. Using the internet is just as good as the portability. and just when you think it may stall (not that its slow at all just low expectations) you see the blue processing line going across the top of the screen like lightning. So far im very much enjoying the tablet.along with this purchase I bought the tech armor anti glare & anti fingerprint screen protector (love it). I recall the reviews being ify but it was a snap for me its a 3 pk comes with a smoother & wiping cloth. I also purchased a silicone skin cover to protect from scratches. I think i will get a case. Its another level of protection it was a life saver for my last tablet. I liked to open in close like a book. One thing I wanted to mention if your looking at your screen and it looks too dark dont worry it auto adjust to your lighting. If the room has low lighting the screen will automatically dim. turn the lighting brighter then the screen gets brighter.  Oh another thing that drove me nuts was wanting to organize or remove apps or delete one of the 3 home screens. To move the apps around hold drag and drop. if you want on another screen hold and drag to either side you'll see a blue line as if turning the page. It'll go to the next screen. To delete apps hold drag and drop to the trash bin. To adjust the home screens while viewing the home screen drag your fingers across screen as if pinching the screen. the screens will minimize and you can drag and drop to the trash bin,
"First the good, people put down the screen resolution being low, but samsung screens are one of the best , there 1024 by 600 resoution is so much better than other screen with same resolution . Side by side with my kindle fire hd i can barely notice much difference. The tab is not extreme fast but it is not slow either, if you install  a task killer or ram manger , you can keep the ram clear and it will improve your browsing experience. People say it take 3 secs more to open apps, really 3 secs if you cant wait an extra 3 secs, its time to slow down your life.
  I test the wifi and it works great the bars are not correct , when iam outside i get one bar but the tab work perfectly still loading pages and loading u-tube, test it yourself u will find even with 1 bar showing the connection is great.This is a perfect tab for movies and emails, the size is quite small and light fits almost perfectly in my pants pocket.
  Since the price drop you can find these as low as 149.00 , which is a great price for the tab. The tv remote is great for using the tab to control tv.
  Most people make fun or hate samsung touch wiz, but i love it , it has lots of useful features and mekes it easy to use the tablet, i have own the nexus 7 2013 and yes it is faster and smoother, but i like the samsung so much better, with the nexus you have to be very gental as it is very thin I was always afraid the screen would crack.
  Like i said if you install a ram manager or task killer and keep the memory clear , you will find the tab work fine, as long as your not expecting it to be blazing fast....
  Really the only real bad is the 8 gigs of strorage which is about 4.5 gigs useable .....",
"I'm not one to go to the top when rating anything, especially when I haven't had it long. But I like it better than a mere 4 stars. I'm still figuring out all the quirks. I wanted a tablet that I could carry when commuting by bike. WiFi only is fine; I have access to networks in most of the places I would want to use it. It saves paying for a data plan.

This little gadget is fast. The 7-inch screen seems quite generous, considering I would have settled for something even smaller. Now that I have it I'm glad I didn't. This one is the ideal size to fit the rack bags on either of the bikes I regularly use to commute. No complaints so far. I'll probably get a Bluetooth keyboard because it it hard to type on the virtual keyboard that comes up on screen. It's still surprisingly effective even with my fat fingers. I wouldn't want to blog a novel on it, but it will do for quick posts, email check-ins and spur of the moment searches.",
"I was looking at quite a few 10.1"" Android Tablets under the $250 mark but left a 7-8"" option open if I found a decent one . I couldn't pass up $149.00 shipped , using Prime . I have a Samsung Centura phone so I was easily familiar with the operating system and functions . Out of the box this tablet is awesome and does the things I want it to do . It's lightweight , battery life is pretty damn good around the 8/hr. mark depending on applications running and usage . It charges quickly like most Samsung products and comes with a nice Samsung-branded charger .

The only thing I wish it had , is the Multi-Window feature found in the Samsung Tab3 8"" and possibly the 5MP rear Camera of the 8"" , since this one is only 3MP . I think a fair competitor would be the ASUS Google Nexus 7"" which has a NVIDIA Tegra 3 quad-core processor and is priced in the same range . I am very happy and would definitely recommend this Tablet to first-time users and those wanting something smaller but very capable .",
"Randomly locks up -- unresponsive, screen goes blank. Happens infrequently, but when it does my work since the last Save is lost and unrecoverable. Others report similar experience with Windows 11. I've downloaded and installed the latest Windows 11 update. Thought that would fix the problem but it bit me again. This is not something that can be very well demonstrated because it can go days without locking up. I don't have the time or the inclination to try all of the various remedies suggested online. (I did a memory scan, which did not cure the problem.) So I'm going to put it on the shelf and use an old machine. Maybe after a few months I'll download the latest updates and try it again. This is really insidious because it can go a long time before locking up and then the likelihood of losing a lot of work is greater. Probably it would be best to throw it in the trash and buy a Windows 10 machine while they're still available.",
"I purchased this unit in mid Feb 2019. After setup all was good and unit was fine. In late June the solid state drive failed. On the description of the unit on the AMAZON site it clearly states there is a FULL year warranty on this unit. Now TekRefurbs AND Amazon are claiming there is only 90 days!! Amazon ""CLAIMS"" the full year warranty is a manufacturers warranty, of course we ALL know the manufacturer has absolutely NOTHING to do with a refurbed unit. I still contacted them as I was asked to do and they confirmed to me that their warranty had expired in 2017, (and had been 3 years long). Still nothing from TekRefurbs NOR Amazon and now to make a bad issue worse, I had purchased an extended warranty when I bought the computer but when I contacted them they also told me the site says it has a year warranty so they will not honor their warranty because it doesn't go effect until the origional one expires! For whatever reason Amazon has now cancelled and refunded the extended warranty I had purchased when I purchased the machine!! I had NEVER mentioned nor asked them to cancel that!! So now I have NO hope of ever getting this covered. Still all I get from TekRefurbs AND Amazon is that the full year warranty is ""manufacturer"" warranty! This is a PRIME example of the beginning of the decline of Amazon. I know as much of my few thousand dollars have already started being spent elsewhere.!!",
"So I ordered the listed computer.  Read all the reviews and was hoping that I was not going to be one of the customers that did not receive the HDMI adapter.  Of course I did not receive it.  On top of that the computer once turned on and hooked up right made a loud noise over and over.  Given the fact it was late I waited till the next morning to try and install everything.  The next morning the computer was making an additional sound on top of the other clicks.  Once setup the Windows key did not work.  I restarted the computer and after I entered my password the screen would just go black and nothing would happen.  I called Amazon and they said they can only help with power problems.  With that we did a 3 way call to the manufacturer.  After having him look up the product he said that the warranty EXPIRED ON THIS IN 2014!  How is that even possible?  I literally just received the computer the day before, and on top of that I was shipped what I can only imagine is someone else return as the windows key was already taken.  Not sure if this is Amazons fault or the manufacturer.  I'm lead to believe it's Amazons as I would hope the manufacturer would not have computers that have expired warranties on their shelves.  I told them I would like to give them a second try and ship me one that has a NEW warranty and with the HDMI adapter, and the Amazon rep told me she could not guarantee that.  So basically my only option was to ship back for a refund.  BEWARE to all who buy this computer, even if it is working I would still call in and make sure your warranty is not EXPIRED! I have never left a negative review but I feel this was so bad I had to.",
"I bought this particular PC in part because it had a large SSD, and WIFI capability. It was the WIFI that put it over the other PCs advertised as similar on Amazon.

Even though it came with virtually no instructions on what to do, I was able to eventually get the thing running and the important apps installed and working, such as email, etc.

But, now i have to find and acquire a WIFI access card or something. It's a disappointment. I'd be tempted to return it, but, dang it, I live 3,000 miles away from the US land mass in Belize. Returning items is no easy task.

Other than that, what can I say? It's a PC, it runs Windows 10 Pro. All the updates installed successfully, and it will work for me for a reasonable amount of money paid out for it. It just rankles me that a simple task, such as making sure the WIFI card (or whatever was supposed to have been included) actually got stuck in the box, couldn't be done right.",
"I purchased this to upgrade an I7 860 so I could have Win 10 PRO without having to build a new tower.
The 3rd gen 3770k and 16g of ram still scream even though it is and 8yr old processor.
Everything works fine except the 2TB storage drive was 10 YEARS OLD!! It was a WD Black drive.
I understand that they run tests on the hardware before they ship these out but a 10yr old hard drive??
These towers were brand new in 2014 so how does a 10yr old HDD get installed as a backup?
I buy WD Black drives for every PC I have because they come with 5yr warranties. I change them out after about 3-4yrs for safety.
Be prepared to replace the WiFi adapter with something better. They sent a little USB one that didn't work very well 2 rooms away from my WiFi 6 router. I just installed a Pci express wireless card also WiFi 6
Same for the keyboard and mouse.
Those 3 items are the cheapest stuff they could find.
I'm keeping the unit but I am tossing the old HDD because you're just asking for failure.
The SSD is also a brand I've never heard of but it appeared new. It was a ""Super Talent""??
This was for the wife to surf the internet, so no biggy if it's an off brand cause I'll just clone it to another SSD for backup.",
"This computer came very well packaged in one of those dedicated computer air cell packs that looks like a heavy duty pool flotation device folded over and heat sealed. The computer case had some minimal signs of prior use but nothing that would constitute what I would call ""wear"". Similarly inside the case was pretty clean although I could still see some dust and dirt buildup if I looked closely and shined a flashlight into the dark corners. It came with everything described in the listing, had open slots in the bus for a half height graphics card. No open memory slots so if you want to go up there you need to buy bigger sticks to replace the ones in there already.  The i7 processor is an older model that is capable but not very fast, not really anywhere near gaming capable as it sits.  I had to put in a graphics card in order to get a DVI output for our 27"" touch screen my son needs for his home schooling programs.  It is fast enough to stream the lectures he has to watch as well as handle the two-way meetings he uses for some of the classes, when I added a HD camera to the mix.  Plenty of USB plugs, some 2.0 and others 3.0 (I have not bothered to try to define which is which as we are not doing anything heavy enough to stress those systems.  It booted up fine and needed minimal oversight for setting stuff up.  We have had no problems in the first 3 months since we got it.
Although it was not purchased for my boy to do gaming, he did try and discovered a significantly faster frame rate but still not good enough transfer rate to run modern graphics intensive games at a speed that satisfies him, so he is back over on his other gaming consoles for that.
The operating system is set up on the solid state drive so it boots up in about half the time of one booting from a hard drive.  And having the big HDD for long term storage is a perfect match.
I am not sure if I would buy it again or not -- I would probably keep my eye out for a similar package but with a more recent and capable generation i7 processor and matching motherboard.  The small form-size is also a bit of a challenge if you plan on dropping a few cards into the bottom end of the bus as you have to make sure they are low profile and half height as there is some room but not a lot of room on the bus.",
"After reading the reviews and determining that I would either be fine, or not at all... I decided to take the 50/50 chance of receiving a decent tower.

Ordered from Stalliontek along with a 1030 low profile GPU from NewEgg with hopes of using this as my 4K capable living room media PC.
I first decided to plug it to a known, working monitor I pulled from my gaming PC set-up.  There was NO HDMI port as advertised, nor any HDMI adapter included.  Ok.. I read reviews of this happening but no worries as my monitor ALSO takes display port (which the tower had two of) and I was going to use the 1030 GPU's HDMI port when I eventually connected this to my living room TV anyway.

While hooking everything up, I smelled the familiar smell of fresh spray paint.  Upon further investigation, I saw fresh black spots on the case where someone spray painted it black.  Ok, no biggy.... as long as the tower works I'm ok with the touched up blemishes.

Whelp, after plugging everything in and using the display port from the MOBO to my known working monitor, there was no signal.  The PC turned on, but no boot, no bios splash screen nothing.  I started, restarted... plugged, unplugged... I tried it all.
Figured, well... maybe it's the display ports that are bad on the MOBO (I tried both of them).  Plugged in my brand spanking new 1030 GPU and used its HDMI port.
No luck with that as well. Still no boot, BIOS splash screen.. nadda

On top of the MAJOR problem of not booting, there was no HDMI adapter, the case was spray painted AND I was unable to find/locate the windows serial number that a few reviews said was attached to the tower.  Upon inspecting the entirety of the case, I also found a poorly removed/scraped previous OS and windows key label.

I build gaming PC's, but I took a chance on this one because I received $200 in Amazon gift cards recently which made this a decent buy for me for $199 out of pocket.
I will also add that I checked for any loose connections, memory etc that may have come loose in shipping, but came up empty handed.
This PC was just DOA.  Also worth noting to those interested, there is no additional room on the MOBO for another SATA connection.  There are 3 total... one for Disc reader, one for SSD boot drive and one for HDD storage drive.

Kudos to the seller for making the return easy at least. So thanks!",
"I received computer carefully packaged in bubble wrap. Unwrapped to find computer in great physical condition, few minor dents.
I opened case to add nvidia video card and found interior clean no dust bunnies, looked new.
I connected it up and checked BIOS version, it was 8 years old. No problem, went to HP website found the most current and downloaded and updated.
I found the OS was Win 10 educator pro, OK..? No problem, I blow away pre-installed OS's anyway. I reloaded Win 10 pro w/current ver 21H2.
I also noticed no COA attached to the computer but computer has digital license so no big deal.

The supplied USB key bluetooth/wi-fi adapter works great. Windows found and installed it immediately. I paired my headphones to it for a quick test, works fine.
I am using the keyboard & mouse supplied w/computer. I love the actuation force for the keys a little stiffer than other keyboards. I'm not impressed w/the mouse.

Computer used for replacement in den. Old Dell is acting up so I just replaced it, hardware problem maybe.

Computer arrived in doublelayer cardboard box, no shipping damage.
In the box:
- computer
- power cord
- keyboard/mouse set
- usb WiFi/bluetooth
- adapter, male display port to female HDMI

Overall impression good. Love the quicker processor! I would buy another.",
"This is easily the best technology purchase I have made in years.

I bought it to replace my ACER laptop which I bought six years ago. This laptop still works fine but I could see that it was struggling to handle multiple open browser windows.  I often have 12+ windows open across three browsers each.  My Acer is a core i5 4300m, 6GB RAM machine - which was admittedly fast in 2012.

Fast forward to this HP desktop. It's super-fast with its 240GB SSD which I think makes all the difference.  The set up with Win 10 Pro was so easy.  The machine is not pre-configured to your product key but instead to some generic key. When you unpack the box, the product key is clearly visible stuck on the back of the machine.  Just write it down and save it somewhere safe. When Win 10 comes up, try and customize it - like the screen or mouse.  It then prompts you for the product key.  And you're done.

When you set up your browsers, choose the option where they remember all your open windows.  The magic is when you restart the machine and click on your favorite browser.  All those browser windows display instantly, yes, instantly.  Opening a document or saving it is also instant.  The SSD is one of the best technology inventions ever.

This desktop practically makes no sound at all.  It's sitting on the floor of my home office.  Also, it freed up valuable space on my desk.  Previously, I had my laptop sitting next to my desk lamp.  Notice how much free space I now have.

The machine comes with sufficient numbers of USB ports that I put away the two dongle USB hubs for my laptop.  It also comes with a USB adapter for WiFi which is plug and play.  Also an adapter to convert your video port into HDMI.

All in all, I'm super impressed with the product.  Great value too, considering that new machines with this configuration cost hundreds more.",
"Just got it this today.  Popped the lid to look inside, everything is tight and in place.  No evidence of damage or whatever.  Fired it up and started my customizations.  So far everything is working fine.  The refurbisher did try to paint over some cosmetic scratches and that's fine but what I am interested in is the condition of the system and so far its fine. Its a couple of notches above my current system so looking for performance improvement with heavy lifting tasks.  Will come back later to update but so far this seems to be good value over a new system.

Update - 4/26/2019 - Have been using now for a few weeks and it seems to be running as expected.  My HP desktop that was failing was able to repair (CPU fan blade had splintered and it cleared) so I have two really good systems.  Since I am not a gamer, the limitation on the video adaptor doesn't concern me.  Since my old system is working again, I can phase in the installation of apps as time permits.  I have read the stories of some folks getting DOA units but mine was solid out of the box.  I am good.",

"Was not expecting much from a tablet costing $68 including tax, and running the outdated Android 10. Just wanted a workhorse tablet to read ebooks on.

However, there is no sim card / TF card slot, although the website description says: ""Card Slot: Dual Card Slot (Two sim cards and one TF card can be installed at the same time).""

On first boot, the tablet opened directly to the home screen with a desktop background of flying birds, not to the expected Android first-time set-up screen.

Settings > about tablet confirms 64 GB of on board storage, but could not find a way to confirm amount of RAM.

Battery runs down shockingly fast, even when the tablet is idle. Could not find a way to confirm battery size.

Extremely rapid battery drain and the lack of the promised external storage slot are dealbreakers for me.

When I tried to return this item, I discovered that I would be expected to pay for return shipping to China, so I am stuck with a ~$70 paperweight. Extremely disappointed.

Cannot recommend item or seller, unfortunately.

UPDATE:

Was on Alibaba and saw this tablet for around half the price I paid here. Scrolled through the photos and discovered that the top of this tablet, at the camera end, is removable and reveals...SIM CARD SLOTS! At a loss as to why this information was not included in the product manual that came with the tablet, nor in the product photos on Amazon, or, indeed, on the tablet itself. But, I am retracting part of the above review, and adding a star since the product is as described.

Battery life is still abysmal though, so can't recommend, unfortunately, unless you plan to keep it connected to its charger while using, which kind of defeats the purpose of a portable tablet.

But, SIM CARD SLOTS! *tiny high five*",
"Purchased two days ago, arrived yesterday, and so this review is NOT based on longevity (I'll come back in a month or two for that), but on features, build quality, and overall feel. Build quality out of the box is good. Body is aluminum and has a nice MacBook (I have an older Mac Air) feel to it. Not much flex when typing (I'm using it for this review), chiclet keys have a good feel to them, and not too cramped, which I like. Back-lit keys are a necessity for me (once you've had them, you never want one without) and this has silver keys with a white backlight. Very clean look. Screen looks great, full HD 1080p, which on a 15"" screen is perfect (4k just seems like overkill on a small screen). Boots FAST, shuts down fast, of course with a solid state hard drive (the future of all computers) no hard drive bottleneck. Fingerprint scanner (on right side near the ""-"" button works most of the time, but honestly, putting in a 4 digit pin is just about as fast. BIG touchpad, with great response. And finally, HP did it right with the Intel i5 and i7 (not Ryzen) models, room to expand. Yes, just pop the bottom cover off, and ""voila!"", you have a spare hard drive bay, and guess what, they installed a single 8GB stick of ram and left the other ram slot empty, so no ditching your existing ram to upgrade. Just purchase another 8GB stick of DDR4 laptop ram and pop it in, 16GB. One downside is the empty hard drive bay does not have the cable you need to go from hard drive to motherboard, and I'm still not sure where to get it. If you find one post below and let me know. Okay, that's it...with 18 months same as cash, this is a great laptop. Sell your old one on eBay! Hope this helps. :)",
"Bought this laptop for my son, who is a college student and was interested in a touchscreen laptop. After 3 weeks, the touchscreen stopped working along with the touchpad, gyroscopic driver, and keyboard. After countless hours of talking to customer service from HP and even letting them have remote-access, they simply do not want to help. In addition, they kept telling me about the raving reviews they had for the laptop. Well, looks like I'm writing the first review. After this debacle, I wouldn't recommend this product or company to any of my fellow Amazon customers. Please consider purchasing a different laptop from a different company who will actually provide decent service.

PS: HP will refuse to help you unless you've purchased the laptop from HP, so this is in no means Amazon's fault. Amazon's hands are tied in this situation and HP simply sold me a faulty product and will not admit it or replace it in a timely manner.",
"I love this laptop, but I've had a couple problems. There is only windows modern standby (S3) available for sleep modes  while plugged in and this thing is constantly turning on my display and fans at night. If it's not in your bedroom - probably not a problem. But it's bad enough for me to knock a star off.

Second - a few times for a few months after it arrived, it would hard lockup while sleeping. No input would wake it and I would have to shut it down with the power button. Don't know if it was some kind of bios or driver issue, but it seems to have gone away and haven't had to do that for quite some time now.

As for the pros - It's a beast of a machine with an RTX3070 and a ryzen processor which are kind of hard to find together. The screen is beautiful. The keyboard is functional but not particularly good or bad. Wifi and Bluetooth are similarly passable. RAM is kind of low on this model and you'll want to upgrade. Note that it contains two 8GB sticks, not a single 16GB so if you want 32GB you need two 16's. M2 socket to add a harddrive is easy to use, but the case is a little challenging to open. Make sure to watch an instruction video.",
"This is a great laptop.

Had another bombastic review written but some Karen seller probably negged it so here we go again.

Last computer was a dual xeon workstation. 64 cores and cpumark was only a few k higher but power consumption at idle was what this thing uses at max.

Equivalent performance. Serious energy savings.

Mines the coin with the right drivers and has almost paid for itself in idle production.

Wait for a fifteen hundo price point (this is prolly where Karen negged me cause sellers be tripping like pronoun peoples when you point out their mental illness). I Digress. This is a fantastic laptop for any sex, male or female will enjoy it immensely.

Whether it's my little pony or cyberpunk it'll run it maxed out 2k with full eye candy.

Make sure you check msrp and hold the line at fourteen ninety nine. Karen will love you.

I own both the 17"" and the 15"" models so I have options when I travel. Both are great. The big difference is an additional full size Sata in the 17"". Cheaper storage upgrades.

I upgraded to 64gb Sammy rammy. Runs it all. Werd.",
"I am a creative professional, who needed a laptop to edit, pictures, videos, make some motion design stuff and experiment with 3D stuff. Now I was coming from an all in one desktop set up called Lenovo 520, which limited me from trying many things, such as 3d but it was good enough for 1080p video editing.

However since I was always on the move with clients, I needed something portable, reliable and strong enough to handle almost everything I throw at it, I was looking at zephyrus g14,g15, legion 5 pro and many laptops in the same class but this one stuck out to me cuz it was giving the best processor available at the time, 5900HX, and the graphic card I wanted, RTX 3070.

Now even though I bought this laptop for professional creative work, this laptop is a gaming BEAST, it handles everything with so much ease, and does it really well. Almost all games are able to achieve higher than 100fps, which is insane, especially for someone like me who has played on consoles all his life, 30fps was usually the limit but theres so many possibilities with a gaming computer.

As for my creative work, it handles everything like a champ! even on battery and igpu turned on it performs extremely well and I see almost no issues, when working on photoshop, or editing my videos.

However not everything is perfect, while this laptop is great in almost all regards, I am often really worried about its longevity. I expect to use this machine for at least 5 years, my issue comes down to how the heat is handled or how toasty it actually gets. I don't mind too much fan noise cuz I have my headphones plugged in and its non existent to me, but while I game on performance mode, which is the default profile setting for cpu,gpu and the fans, I see temperatures around 80 or sometimes even 85 while playing Witcher 3, on high settings, I bring it down to medium settings and it almost makes no big difference, and sometimes even in my creator tasks which aren't very demanding, it again reaches around 70 degrees celcius. I have however found a solution to this, and use manual profile, which does get a bit loud but the temps are great. however I do worry about the fans and their lifespan cuz of it. you can always get a cooling pad and help yourself as well. i heard people get great results from that as well.

in conclusion, the best laptop I have tried, amazing performance, amazing size and fun to play on. worth it in my use case, only downside being the temperatures but you can work around the problem in various ways!",
"This computer is a beast. What I was really impressed with is how long you can use it on battery if you aren’t doing heavy gaming. You can set it to igpu mode which will let it last 8-9 hours on battery as long as you put it on silent mode. For streaming, browsing and doing documents it should last at least 6 hours.

I really wanted a 1440p screen but with this screen at 300hz it’s beautiful! I’m not a big fan of LCD but it’s a very high quality screen. Pictures don’t do it justice. If I want 4K I’ll just hook it up to a TV.

I like that it’s a very small 15’ laptop. It’s not chunky at all and it’s not over designed. I thought I would have heat issues with a 3070 but the laptop handles the heat very well. It’s not burning my legs when gaming.

I’ve had no problem playing all my games maxed out. A lot of the benchmarks I see for this use poorly optimized games so it’s not fair to this laptop.

The keyboard is nice. I didn’t want a mechanical keyboard because they get noisy. With LEDs off on everything it looks low profile. It’s really easy to turn the LEDs and to customize.

I really haven’t seen any bottlenecks for what I use it for. This laptop is the sweet spot. In my opinion this is better designed than the Zephyrus because the rear heat exhaust isn’t hitting the screen.

Only thing I would have liked to see is a numpad with the keyboard and an aluminum frame.",
"Being my first Mini Computer I was impressed with the size vs advertised specs.  To my surprise after hooking the machine up everything seemed to be in order and functioning.  UNTIL!!!

Literally days before the unit's 90days with me arrived, disaster.  Unit boots, black screen, BOIS.  Anytime and Every time.  Tried all the troubleshooting I could come across.  So as i gave up hope and contacted Amazon (still 2 days it it's 90th with me), who informed me they would not issue a replacement nor would they accept the unit as a return.  They instructed me to research the manufacture myself for contact info.  Way you go Amazon CS you really followed through here (Amazon CS did stay true to themselves - BECAUSE THEY TREAT ALL MY RECENT ISSUE LIKE THIS).  Long story make slightly shorter, after finally finding some link/email for manufacture but received no response  from them (1month to date).  The seller was very reluctant to offer their help it seems.  Partly due to there being no data recovery policy in place for this unit and or situations similar to mine. So far best offer to fix this is 1.)I pay for shipping to manufacture, and SUBMIT the bill to seller for reimbursement 2.)Some time after shipping unit to manufacture and submitting proof to seller, SELLER will send me a similar replacement unit as soon as they can. (NO TURN AROUND TIMES GIVEN FOR ANY OF THE 2 ABOVE ACTIONS OR FOLLOWING) 3. Instructed to remove the SSD from the defective unit and connect it to another machine somewhere to retrieve my info - Who ever thought of that procedure and implemented it in real life situations needs a vacation.  LONG TERM without peanut spending money.",
"Second Best - Mini i have purchased recently. Also, the Bosgame N95 has turned out well too. Upgraded the ram on N95 to 16gb, and added 2.5"" sata's on both. This i5-1135G7 is a workhorse. Fast. The pc works well in all demanding software i have used, and has become the most used of all i have in the minis. Fast in all aspects and quiet. No lock-ups or reboots. Nice Quality Product i am glad to have. A word on/to reviews/ers: If you don't know how to upgrade hardware,  use it like it was sold to you. i.e. Don't tear it up from inability, then give the company/seller a 1 star rating. Sure the sata cable connetions on most these minis are flimsy, like some excuses. If you want Tough: buy a case,powersupply, motherboard, cpu,ram, drives, All of good quality,, and build you one that doesn't flex here and there, and has real upgrade options. Don't forget the OS - which may cost you half of what you paid for the Bosgame i5-1135G7 that already has it.",
"I’ve never had an ASUS laptop before so I wasn’t sure how it was going to feel, it felt great. Trackpad is responsive, but a bit loud. It’s been 2 Years with this laptop all through college and airports and It’s held up great! The battery is not very great and you really need to bring the charger everywhere you go unless you’re just moving rooms in your house for less than an 1 and a half. It can get annoying trying to watch Netflix or YouTube and it constantly needs to be plugged in. While gaming you definitely need to plug in or your games will run half as slowly as they should be, it’s a feature to save battery but it makes the gameplay horrible. I can say this laptop replaced my gaming desktop and I’ve used it basically everyday for 2 years, and it’s still running smooth.

I would definitely recommend getting another stick of RAM for the laptop, there’s a free slot already so you just need to get either an 8gb or 4gb stick of laptop ram depending on what you already have, just match it up and your games will be running amazingly.

It can easily play GTA V, Fortnite, Warzone, basically anything you throw at it if you play with the graphic settings. I also recommend buying a gaming mouse because using the trackpad can be impossible for certain games.

The most annoying thing about the laptop is that all the ports. 3 USBs, Ethernet, charging, is all on the left side of the computer so using wired mice and headsets can get annoying, and you have to loop it behind. Just the one complaint i have over the years.",
"I was excited to finally have a decent laptop with fantastic features and life like screen, but beneath the features this Asus FX-505DT laptop has major issues....despite long talks with Asus techs, and hours at home, this laptop fails to measure up.  All i wanted to do is use a USB device to run/install some programs and install a dual boot operating system,  despite hours to get the BIOS to respond, this laptop refuses to recognize ANY USB device, any USB device, thumb drive, external dvd player, any USB device.  Even with a purge of the BIOS, and complete reset of Windows 10, this machine refuses to recognize any USB device... A necessary feature in the bios , CSM fails to appear...unable to disable UEFI...and there's .more, which i wont bore you with.  I spoke to Asus techs who told me the USB devices should be recognized if windows 10 was installed and active.  This made no difference...enough.  To say the least, i am disappointed.  I have great respect for Asus brand products for desktop computers, but for this laptop, my first Asus laptop, two thumbs down.",
"I bought this laptop specifically so I can play First-person shooter games at 120 fps and use that 120hz screen to my advantage. Unfortunately, the Ryzen 7 3850h alongside the GTX 1650 M is not enough to play games such as Fortnite at 120 fps. I had all my settings set to low except view distance and 3D resolution, and I was barely getting 80 fps, which would drop down to 50 during heated fights. During night time in-game, I would hardly see anything because of how dim the screen was.
Overall, the device is worth the price but might not be what you are looking for. I would suggest their A15 model equipped with the RTX 2060 and the Ryzen 7 4800h for First-Person Shooter games such as Fortnite, Apex, CS GO, etc.

To conclude, the Asus fx505 is a device that is worth its price but might not be for heavy gaming because of the low specs it has and its dim screen. For 300 dollars more, you can get the A15, which is more equipped for heaving gaming.

Oh, and the fans get loud during games, but it doesn't bother me.",
"I'm solid ASUS, my last one still works had for 8 years. Actually gave it to my daughter. I have all Samsung ram, hard drives upgrades.
I haven't had more blue screens of death. I have about $1,600 wrapped up in this damn thing. Problem is a Zeus don't kick out any driver upgrade software. And neither does Microsoft. For all this money I shouldn't have to pay out the nose for more software.
The problem is is AMD has software, Asus has software, Samsung, and every other little driver. Well they all put their little storage banks on the hard drives then adds up real fast.
I just need the driver's I don't need all this bloatware.

I don't know a Zeus has a software program that is a program but you must have the Microsoft app to go with it which I think Microsoft apps suck and is part of the combat compatibility issue. But as soon as I load them drivers my crap freezes.
I'm just really disappointed. I pretty much have a $1,600 brick. You must really know what you're doing to tolerate this poo. Make sure you have a thumb drive bootable. might as well put all your software on on another thumb drive too.
I bought this for a good motherboard and foundation upgradable for reason.
I last a Zeus notebook upgrades no problem.
I have wanted to throw this off the third story building, and smash it to pieces I'm not upset then I realize how much money I have into it.
Also noticed my wireless mouse 2.0( in 2.0 port) has issues bad wont work with 3.1 drives 3.0 ports (2.0 compatible) Mouse freaks out and wont work at all. But as im writing this I have two 2.0 thumbs in the same ports and works just fine.",
"I was very impressed by the item description and read a couple of reviews and quickly purchased the ASUS TUF (2019) Gaming Laptop, 15.6” 120Hz Full HD IPS-Type, AMD Ryzen 7 3750H, GeForce GTX 1650, 8GB DDR4, 512GB PCIe SSD version.  While waiting for UPS to deliver the laptop, as it needed a signature, I started reading all the reviews. I quickly became very concerned with the reviews detailing the BSOD's and black screens. I then googled video reviews, and found that almost all reviewers by professional techs recommended this laptop as a beginner's gaming machine.

I have now used the laptop for approximately 12 hours and have these observations. First the negative. I HATE that all USB slots are on the left side of the laptop. There is nothing on the right side. I spend a lot of time gaming and laying down with the laptop on my belly and I have my left hand resting on the left side as I constantly use the Function 1-4 keys. The USB plug in adapter is rubbing a blister on my hand as there is no way to avoid it unless I don't use a mouse, which is unacceptable. The arrow keys are a little to far towards the middle, so I had to program the number pad keys for moving in game. Also, the F1 key starts too far to the right, so I have had to program my gaming keys somewhat.

With that said, the laptop runs smoothly, is very quiet and does not run hot at all. Now I only play Everquest which is not a demanding game for a PC, but there is no heat or noise from the fans. I like the keyboard other than what I described above, and have no idea why some people have complained about the keyboard and touch pad. The lighted keyboard does change colors, but it isn't a distraction for me at all, so I haven't tried to change it to stay at one color as of yet.

So I like this laptop. If I experience any issues I will update my review.",
"I had high hopes about this laptop, as I saw that it was well rated and ASUS is a dependable brand. However, within three months, the hard drive failed completely with without warning from the SMART system, and I lost everything on it. At that point, I reached out to Snow Bell for a refund for the cost of the hard drive, which they quickly got back to me about and everything was great.

Since then, I've just had a world of problems with this laptop. The system device and display drivers kept failing, making my HDMI port unusable. Several of my keys are discolored or partially burnt out. The function allowing me to change my fan speed didn't work any longer than the first day I used it. The track pad, as some other users have complained about, is slow to respond and often rebellious against what you actually want it to do. The screen flickers like a candle when the brightness is anything but 100% when it's running on battery, and the fan on the left side rattles loudly if the laptop is anything but perfectly level.

Of course, I reached out to Snow Bell again, but where their customer service got back to me in a matter of hours before, it's been days and they seem to be nowhere to be found. Even Amazon failed to connect me to their customer service call center. Maybe I just got a dud, but I'm thanking my past self for purchasing a warranty, as that seems to be my only option for this lemon now.",
"When i first got the laptop it was fast. I had issues with the operating system, apparently I received a corrupt OS. After reinstalling windows which is no problem at all fast and easy process I'm back to normal. Overall a very fast laptop.
Gaming: I can run Metro Exodus on high settings WOW no problem. Honestly, there is really not a game that you cant play on high settings and get a decent frame rate plus the screen makes the games look AWSOME. Also the fans get loud to keep the beast cool, but who cares if your buying this for gaming your going to have either headphones or a headset so that doesnt really matter to me.
BUT do yourself a favor and get another stick of RAM to unlock the potential of this computer, because the laptop is gimped by that one stick of DDR4.
General Use: I mean it has a sdd lets be honest its quick in doing anything browsing the web and those sorts of things.
OVERALL: Would i buy again? Yes i believe if you have any sorts of knowledge about computers your going to buy this and be able to fix any problems you come across. Its a powerful computer that's portable for gamer's. I'm extremely satisfied with this computer. Only thing i might upgrade now is another ssd in the computer for more storage.",
"This product works fine EXCEPT for the sizing/partitioning of the hard drive. The product description indicates a 192gb hard drive, which is does have, however, it was received with the drive already partitioned into a c: drive of 62gb and a d: drive of 128gb. It would be expected that the drive, if partitioned at the factory, would have a much smaller d: drive loaded with recovery data for consumer to use in the event of an issue sometime down the road; giving the consumer the option to partition the drive to his/her particular desires. Though that issue can be corrected by the consumer, it is disappointing that the option is not readily available to less-experienced users.
UPDATE: Purchased in June 2022. Trusted Amazon and HP - my mistake. This product is a toy compared to a real computer. I am disappointed in its performance but even more disappointed in the inability to upgrade the unit to make it more in-line with what I use a computer for - had no idea it could not be tweaked to improve the internal storage and memory. Basically piece of garbage - will rework my Toshiba laptop even though it is older technology and will not accept Windows 11 but that is a secondary issue - at least it is a better overall machine!!!!!!",
"cant get online. Says i have to first register windows, but when i try, it says it cant register my version of windows (which is listed as windows 10 and has what appears to be a valid product key), and i have to first visit ""the store"" and purchase A GENUINE VERSION OF WINDOWS. . .So i guess that means this computer came with a fake version of windows that allows you to turn it on and set it up, but wont actually allow you to use the computer and go online or anything. I cant even use Word because it too has to be registered online, which requires that i first register windows, but again, i cant. Already loaded too many personal files on it to be comfortable returning it, so i guess what i bought is a really really expensive external hard drive to store my media on, because that is the only thing it will allow me to do.

I stopped buying Dell over a decade ago because their quality went way down and their stuff just wasnt worth anything to me anymore. I decided to give it a shot again cause i just needed something small and inexpensive to use mainly for writing. I wasnts expecting anything great, but I never dreamed that their quality would be so severely lacking now that i wouldnt even be able to use Word or get online to download another word processor!  Ill never buy a Dell ever again.",
"I got 3 of these during the black friday sale on dell.com and they have all had problems!  I never write a reveiw and am only on here because I've wasted so much time with this product.  I'm sorry guys because I buy a lot of good products and I rely on customer reviews and always want to leave one but am never motivated enough till I've lots so much time and money.

One of the three was DOA and was sent back for a refund because the other two seemed to have Chinese malware installed and I manually removed but didn't want to do it for a third one (all gifts) after that.

Of the two remaining, one is rarely used because the person said its too slow!  You will click a button and then watch it click on the system a second later and then start a really slow load.  The person using it is young and so hasn't used it much or complained but I know its just junk.

The third one that has been used for school is broke after 7 months of causal use.  The F1 key popped out 1st.  The left hinge stopped working a month ago.  Now the ""reduce volume seems to be stuck but if you press it, it responds so it must be a software issue but it's volume down icon on the screen is stuck and keeps trying to go lower.  We have tried to do a factory reinstall but it's still stuck.  Dell wants $219 to fix the F1 key and hinge and can't say if the volume down software issue can be fixed.  I paid $299 for these devices on black friday and have lost hundreds more in time trying to clean them up and maintain them out of guilt for the recipients.

This is just a truly sad product and I hope it just all came from a bad batch for Dell and their customers sake.",
"Bought this for my mom. She wanted something light weight and she liked the color. This piece of garbage isn't worth a $100. I didn't expect it to be a fast computer but slow isn't the right word for it. Sometimes it just stops. When it gets like that you may as well set it on the table and leave it until it finally starts doing something several minutes later. I'm talking about basic tasks like opening a web browser or even logging on from startup. It would just get stuck. We kept it up to date and ran virus scans regularly. She only used it to check facebook, email and basic web browsing. It should have never been released, especially for $500. If it's trying to do a windows update you can't do anything else with it until the update is complete because it doesn't have the processing power to do more than one thing at a time. A $500 computer should be able to easily handle basic tasks. We will probably wipe it and give it to a thrift store. I wouldn't give it to anyone I know. I'm definitely disapointed to know Dell would sell something like this. Maybe we got a bad one but I have seen enough bad reviews to know ours isn't the only bad one.",
"I purchased this device as a replacement for my Dell Inspiron 11 3147. My older device was having issues with the touchscreen (as well as other hardware issues) and was no longer under warranty so I decided to find a replacement. After a LOT of research into other brands, Dell was the only brand I could find with an 11.6"" screen that had a decent processor, so I bought a newer version of my older model.

The Bali Blue is really nice. The color has more purple in it than the pictures would lead you to believe, which was a little bit of a let down, but still looks great. However, the case is very cheap plastic, think those old lunch boxes from the 90s, it feels a lot like that. This is a definite downgrade from the 3147 model, which had a sturdy metal casing. The screen also seems to be of lower quality than the 3147 had. Even looking at it straight on, you will notice that the bottom of the screen is brighter than the top. If you pull up an all black image (like the Dell boot screen) you'll notice that the top is black (as it should be), while the bottom is a bright gray, approaching white). This is not usually an issue when using in laptop mode. However, if you switch it to tablet mode and rotate into portrait mode to say, read a book,whichever side was bottom in laptop mode is noticeably brighter than the other. It makes the text appear to become boldened as you read. Also, if the book you are reading does not take up the whole screen, you will have black bands at the top and bottom, which is normal. But, with the brightness issue, if you move the tablet even a little while you read, the brightness seems to flicker and can be really distracting. (To note: it does not actually flicker, it just appears to due to the screen not appearing the same from all angles).

First and second boot ups were really slow when compared to my older model, but it seems to be doing better now. (Probably had to do with background apps downloading updates, etc.)

The keyboard is firm and responsive and feels like an improvement over the older 3147 model. Time and use will determine if this is the case.

You cannot upgrade the RAM in this unit as it is soldered to the motherboard unlike the 3147 model. Processor also cannot be upgraded for the same reason.

TL;DR: This was given 3 stars, because as a standalone it's a fairly average and inexpensive device. Compared to the previous model this should probably be a 2 star rating due to cheaper materials/hardware and cosmetic changes. Ultimately feels like a downgrade over the older model.",
"Overall I'm satisfied with this laptop.  The size is small and it is very light to carry around.  The processor speed is fine for basic web browsing and video streaming.

One major negative of this laptop is that the standard Dell Wireless card is very poor.  It is only capable of 2.4GHz and I only got 20 Mbps speed.  Even opening a website was slow and sometimes it didn't work properly.  My dual band router or its settings could have been a factor but I could not find a setting that worked.  The wireless speed was so bad that I thought about returning it.  However, I found a simple upgrade that allowed me to connect to the 5 GHz band and get back the wireless speed at 800-900 Mbps.

I bought the following wireless card from Amazon and used the YouTube video link to learn how to access and remove the existing card.
-- 7260NGW Intel® Dual Band Wireless-AC 7260 802.11ac, Dual Band, 2x2 Wi-Fi + Bluetooth 4.0
-- [...]
A minor drawback is the keyboard and touchpad.  The keyboard keys feel stiff and the touchpad feels cheap and sometimes not sensitive or responsive.

But I think the laptop meets my needs pretty well at a decent price point.",
"No problems so far. I once made the mistake of buying an expensive Dell thinking it would last me longer. Not true when the mother board stops working and it's outside the warranty. So now, I buy cheap ones like these and just replace them when they stop functioning correctly without it being a big hit to my wallet. It works just fine for all my needs - mainly internet use. I store all my files in the cloud now (another lesson learned) so it doesn't bog down my memory and I don't lose everything when it inevitably won't turn on one day. My only frustration with this model is that the power button is flush with the right side of the computer. Sometimes when I am trying to move the computer around, I accidentally hit the power button. I would prefer if it were up near the keyboard so I don't bump it accidentally and put it in sleep mode. The lid is ultra glossy so I am sure it will get scratched very easily. I bought a simple neoprene sleeve (amazon basics) to store it in because I don't want it to look like garbage within a short time of having it. The power block on the cord is smaller than my last one, so that's nice. It's light so easy to carry with me and does the job. I'm satisfied.",
"Great mid-range tablet, so far. If you immediately update the firmware and the rest of the software on it you won't have any of the automatic shut off problems other used to list. It seems Samsung has fixed the problem quite a while ago. In terms of battery life, it's surprising how long this thing can hold a charge. If you're a heavy user (i.e. movie/shows back-to-back, digital drawing, constant web surfing) expect it to last all day. I'm a light user and have had the charge last me all week. As for the included SD card, while nice, you should really opt for a 256GB one. The paltry on-board space and the included SD card will fill up fast. If you can't, be aware that some apps can't be swapped over to the SD card to free up space on your tablet. For example Amazon's Audible app and Kindle app can be sent to external storage on the SD card, but Prime Video cannot. Also since this is a Samsung tablet it's full of their bloatware that most people don't end up using and takes up valuable space, though you can disable most of them so they're at least not taking up system resources. The tablet surprisingly boasts some nice privacy options for those uncomfortable with the prospects of being tracked or giving up personal data to Big Tech. Though if you're going to use this tablet you will probably need a Google account, but at least you can decide what info you wish to give them. The tablet feels sturdy and looks to be made with quality, but you'll probably want to get some sort of case and screen protector for it. Play it safe.  It comes with your standard micro USB charging cord, and an outlet charging adapter. I may be wrong, but I believe it's a fast charging adapter. I say this because I bought a magnetic charging cable for this tablet to reduce the strain on the charging port, and the magnetic cable claims to be fast charge capable as long as the device and its outlet adapter support it. So I tried it out and was able to charge this tablet to 100% in 45 minutes. Not too shabby. It also supports capacitive styluses if you feel so inclined to use one for note taking or drawing and editing.

So if you're looking for decently priced tablet as a starter, or one for your kids, this model ain't so bad. It won't have all the bells and whistles of say, a Galaxy Tab S5E or an iPad Pro, but that's ok, I'd rather not part with $500-$800 on a tablet anytime soon.",
"Great buy! Everything as described by the seller, easy to use, and it works great. I recently order the jumper Mini PC with 16GB RAM and 1024GB SSD, powered by the Intel N100 processor. I must say, this mini desktop computer has exceeded my expectations.

Easy to set up. It came pre-installed with Windows 11, which is a welcome addition as it offers a sleek and user-friendly interface. The 16GB RAM ensures smooth multitasking, allowing me to effortlessly switch between applications without any lag or slowdowns. The 1024GB SSD provides ample storage space for all my files, documents, and media.

The Intel N100 processor delivers impressive performance, with clock speeds of up to 3.4GHz. Whether I'm browsing the web, streaming videos in 4K UHD, or running demanding software, this mini PC handles it all with ease. The processing power is truly impressive, making it suitable for both work and entertainment purposes.

Connectivity options on this mini PC are top-notch. With WiFi 6 and Bluetooth 5.0 capabilities, I can seamlessly connect to the internet and pair my wireless devices without any hassle. The dual HDMI ports and Type-C port allow for versatile display options, making it convenient to connect multiple monitors or projectors. Watching content in 4K UHD resolution is a treat, thanks to the excellent graphics support.

I appreciate the compact and space-saving design of this mini PC. It fits perfectly in my setup without taking up much desk space. The build quality is solid, and the device feels durable and well-made. The overall performance and functionality of this mini PC make it a reliable and efficient companion for my daily computing needs.

In conclusion, the jumper Mini PC with its impressive specifications, ease of use, and excellent performance is a great investment. Whether you're a professional looking for a compact and powerful workstation or a home user seeking a versatile and capable entertainment hub, this mini desktop computer ticks all the boxes. I highly recommend it to anyone in need of a reliable and feature-rich computing solution.",
"I have protection on my computer so this is not a virus. The computer is horrible. It'll be working just fine and then all of a sudden it freezes and the only way to get it to do anything is a hard restart. I work on computers doing support so I know different workarounds, but it's the computer. I don't know if this one mis faulty or what, but it's awful!

I have done everything and yet it's still doing it. This is basically now a piece of garbage and I don't think they care because once you give them your money, they move on. Too many people buying from them and no accountability!
____

I was able to send this back to get repaired and wanted to update about interaction at that point. I sent the computer to be repaired and the seller had provided a label so that was free. My tracking number indicated it had been received so I waited to hear from them telling me they'd gotten it. Nothing. So I emailed them and they finally did say they'd gotten it and I should give them 10 days and they'd send it back. No updates, nothing. I'm just supposed to divine, I guess, what they're doing and hope and pray that I get the computer back working. Not happy. I mean, glad they're willing to repair this, but it would sure be nice if they would take time to update me.

I have returned it twice for repairs and it's doing the same thing. And the restocking fee is $125. This is a big scame. Please don't fall for it!!!!!!!!!",
"I purchased a refurbished linksys router.  After 2 or so days of normal operation, the device stopped broadcasting on the 2.5 ghz channel.  Probably why it was returned in the first place.  I spent 45 minutes on the phone with linksys support and they couldn't get it working (resetting router, updating firmware, etc.).  I did some internet research and found that the issue I experienced was fairly common.  I returned the router via amazon.

I ordered another refurbished model (this time I stepped up to the EA9400) and it worked for about a day before it became stuck in a reboot mode.  Even a reset attempt of the router would not get it out of this reboot ""loop"".  Found many others had experienced the same and it required sending back the unit.

I WILL NEVER BUY A REFURBISHED LINKSYS PRODUCT AGAIN.  THEY OBVIOUSLY DON""T DO ENOUGH TO FIND THE ORIGINAL PROBLEM ON RETURNED DEVICES.  THEY SIMPLY FLASH THE SYSTEM, DUST IT OFF AND PACKAGE IT BACK UP TO BE SOLD TO THE NEXT UNSUSPECTING VICTIM...",
"Tried to set the router up, but wes stopped at every try. Called support and after a good bit of workaround, got into the setup. Connected the unit to our netwrok (small business) and then attached the USB external drive. The router started rebooting on its own. Got past that and set up the driver for access. Hung up with support, then the entiire unit went offline again. Reset it, then tried to connect to phone. Wireless strength was only 1 or 2 bars right next to the unit. Also no internet connection on wireless, but did have internet connection on ethernet. Nex day called support aagain. Began another long, drawn out process to troubleshoot, then tech stopped and said to return unit to Amazon. Hh then wanted to upsell me to the EA9500 for $160 more than I paid for this unit and buy it directr from Linksys. I said no thank you and ended the call. Complete disaster. DO not buy the EA9xxx series of routers. There is serious trouble. Do some internet searches and you will see. Buyer beware!",
"I am going to be frank. I read the reviews and decided to take my chances as there seemed to be more positive than negative reviews. That was my mistake.

Over the last few days I had been having some issues with my laptop because it did not seem to be charging. At first I attributed this to the charger and ordered another one. Well, when it got here and there was no sign of the laptop charging I knew that this was something else. I tried the old charger in a last ditch effort and the light from the charger would be green right up until I plugged it into the laptop then it would turn off.

I called Amazon and they directed me to Dell support where I was told that it was something in the hardware and that these things happen and not to worry.

Well I am very f-n worried because I had a ton of assignments for school on there that I can't access because the laptop that I paid good money for turned out to have shoddy craftsmanship. I now have to wait 10-12 days for repairs. I have had this laptop for less than 3 months. In what world do things require repair when you've just bought them?!

Do yourself a favor and look somewhere else if you want a laptop that will last. If you'll excuse me I'll be trying to redo my assignments from scratch for the next several days ??",
"My first Windows 10 computer, and my first flipbook after using a MacBook and then a Chromebook. Overall, a solid computer. But the touchpad is not sensitive enough. Clicks don't get registered the first time. Moving the mouse just a little with touchpad doesn't work, usually. I had to turn off pinch to zoom because it was always activating when I didn't mean for it to. Same with right-click in the lower right corner. And still I have problems, even after those changes to settings.

Use of some websites is frustrating because of this. And this after turning touchpad sensitivity up to high. On one job app website, I had to click everything two or three times to get it to work. Even typing this review was frustrating because the cursor would jump around.

Otherwise, a fine computer for the price. Far less frustrations in tablet mode. Maybe a firmware or OS update will resolve this issue. Or maybe someone in comments can fill me in on the right tweak to settings.",
"I was a little apprehensive ordering this laptop due to the lack of enough reviews, and also from reviews from other tech sites. Some about the brightness of the screen, some about the quality of the RGB color gamut range, some about the ""junk"" included with the laptop.
I received the laptop fast with Amazon Prime, in very good packaging and good condition. Initial setting was a breeze, and immediately had a good feeling about the speed of the hardware/system. Once all windows updates were applied, I always go to control panel to remove all unwanted ""junk"". Surprised that there was not any at all. Pretty clean, and I did not have to remove anything. There was not MacAfee,  nor other annoying trial versions of any programs. Only some Windows apps, mostly games, that it was easy to remove from the store. That was very good, and went on installing my own programs such as Office 2016, ACDsee photo suit, etc. No problems. The screen quality is pretty good, I did not get this laptop for photo editing, I do that on my desktop. As far as the screen brightness is concerned, people seem to not take under consideration that a good part of it is tide to the power plan used by the user. That is very easily changed under the notification panel on the right of the taskbar, where the brightness of the screen can be control to taste. Then you can have a much brighter screen. I am not sure that it will be bright enough for ""interrogations"", however is bright enough for me.
Bottom line, I am very pleased with the laptop. It's portability is a fun aspect of its use. It is a good looking laptop, and yes, so far I love it.
I would recommend this laptop for general and comfortable use. Please remember, it is not an $1,800.00 machine, but it is perfect for what was meant to be used on this price range, and a joy to use.
Additionally, it is upgradeable, so one will not have to pay that $1,800.00 price for more memory and larger storage capacity.",
"This laptop is perfect in every way.

It's pretty compact and light - so it's perfect for bringing to work or classes. The laptop is well-made and can probably sustain some abuse.
The battery is outstanding. It easily gets 8 to 12 hours on a single charge. This is with normal usage (normal screen brightness, browsing/using Word with no volume).
The touch screen and touch pad both work great. I haven't had any issues with either of these.
Sound quality is very good. The display is beautiful.

This laptop also has quite a bit of horsepower. It can process quite a few programs at once, and it boots up quickly. I'm always too lazy to close unused programs, and this laptop has been pretty forgiving in that regard. Oddly, this laptop is also good at connecting to the internet. It's great at great strong signals.
The keyboard is great. Keys are well-placed and easy to press.

This laptop isn't the best for gaming. It can run games, but not nearly as well as something you'd get from a gaming laptop. I don't use it for gaming, so that's fine. If this laptop were $1500, I wouldn't question it. You're really getting a lot of bang for your buck here in terms of specs. And I haven't had any glitches or problems to speak of. Just get rid of the anti-virus program, it's annoying.",
"I bought this laptop after my previous unit crapped out on me. Considering the price tag, I expected it be pretty decent, however, I have had problems with this Dell literally from the beginning.

From the first time I booted up, I was presented with a screen stating ""AC POWER ADAPTER WATTAGE AND TYPE CANNOT BE DETERMINED."" Despite this, the laptop charged just fine, however, just two days later, the laptop will no longer charge, and when I hover over the battery icon, it says, ""(plugged in, not charging)."" When I check the BIOS at startup, it says AC Adapter type is ""UNKNOWN."" I am using the same 45W Dell AC adapter that came with the computer. The adapter appears to be in perfect condition, and the green LED light is on. I have tried plugging it in to different outlets in my home, and I receive the same result. I tried updating the BIOS. I used Dell's online diagnostic tool for hardware problems, as well as the diagnostic tool specifically for this AC charging problem, but no problems were detected.

I emailed Dell's Tech support, detailing all of the information above, and they clearly did not read my email, because they asked me to do all of the things I already mentioned. They then told me I could send it back for repairs that will take 10-12 days to complete.

What bothers me most about this, is that if you do a quick Google search regarding this AC adapter problem, you will immediately get results regarding Dell computers, so this is clearly a problem they are aware of. I did not spend $800 in order to receive a faulty product that the manufacturer is aware is faulty. I use this unit for schoolwork, and being without it for 12 days is an unreasonable expectation. At this point, I am debating whether I want to get it fixed or just send it back for a refund. I did not want a Dell to begin with, but this seemed like a good deal. I am now regretting that decision.",
"I was very excited to receive this 2 in 1 earlier this week! The quality and design or the machine seems sturdy and functional. Unfortunately the machine freezes regularly and i must constantly restart. Now the track pad doesn't work at all. I had worries when the computer arrived unprotected bouncing around a big box without any documentation and without a stylus. I suspect the seller sent a refurbished model.
  •• update ••
I returned the first computer and bought the same model again from another seller. So glad I did!! Thankfully Amazon makes it so easy to return! The new one arrived with proper packaging, documentation and a stylus. The previous one was clearly used before. Th is one arrived with a clean install of Windows 10 and is working great. As mentioned in other reviews the bottom gets hot. I put something between the laptop and my lap so that's not too much of a concern. This is the perfect size to carry around is very sturdy. I am enjoying being able to easily switch to tablet mode.",
"VNOPN K5-F14H mini pc is quiet and very capable of performing day to day tasks nicely. It appears to be well constructed, tight seams and smooth surfaces with even paint job.

There’s a total of 8 USB-A ports, unfortunately not all are USB-3, only front 4 with single USB-C port along with 4 video outs which is a combination of 2 DP and 2 HDMI on back.

Case cover is constructed of plastic with honeycomb pattern, not a fan as it makes cleaning harder, along with fan intake on top and side vents. Intake opening are fairly large and no removable mesh filter helping to keep particles out.

Windows 11 setup did not go through normal out-of-box experience process, like selecting preferences or connecting to Wi-Fi network, it automatically sign in as administrator. Appreciate it did not come preinstalled with bloatware which is nice, unlike some other manufactures, just standard Microsoft junk.

I’m able to run all my applications without issue and even able to play older game like Mass Effect Legendary Edition at higher resolution. Noticed fan continuously spins up and down even when not working on anything intensive, like web browsing.

Minor annoyance, not all USB-A ports being USB-3, there’s no justification for having older USB-A ports.

Be mindful, device is stuck with loaded BIOS as vendor doesn’t appear to have website for support.",
"The computer  arrived on time and was well packaged. I purchased it to replace a 12-year-old i7 tower desktop. I immediately began to test its functionality: I partitioned the internal SSD to create a small disk for onboard files. Next, Updated the OS with version 22h2 and the latest BIOS with ease. Then,  I installed basic applications from my old i7. I added a 500 gb hdd and backed up the system. Next, I created a recovery DVD on my Blu-ray and made sure the computer would start from the recovery disk. Using a docking station, I was able to access both 1080p monitors through each usb-c  port. Naturally the 2 HDMI worked well also. I was even able to boot the computer using a 16gb usb 3.0 attached to the docking station. The computer had no issues recognizing the 8 TB external hard drive, DVD drive or usb jump-drive. The internal fan is quiet and  keeps the computer mildly warm.
I have purchased 2 Gen-10 NUC's previously and they have been very reliable. I am looking forward to experiencing the advances this NUC 12 Pro provides.

"I purchased this NUC12 Pro (32GB + 1TB) to use with a 50 inch Samsung 4K UHD TV.  I use this system to do CAD work (Fusion 360), circuit simulations, video editing and live OBS sessions with multiple cameras.  It works great.  I was previously using a Surface Studio, but it was having trouble keeping up with the video loads and did not play well with the monitor, though that could be the fault of the DisplayPort to HDMI adapter I was using.  The direct HDMI outputs of this NUC produce an excellent picture on the 4K monitor, even when viewing subtle shading changes that I could not easily see previously.

I received the NUC, plugged in a keyboard, mouse, network cable,  and the 4K monitor and fired it up.  After a few minutes of updating Windows 11 to the current release level I was able to load in my software and get going.  I have had no problems whatsoever in loading lots of software and data and running multiple compute-intensive programs simultaneously.",
"This is the 4rd NUC model I have purchased for the university I work at (the other models being the NUC5i3RYH, NUC5i5RYH, and NUC6i5SYH) and it has been a charm to work with. I ordered 14 these to update a teaching lab. I chose this model mainly due to cost but also because of availability. I would have rather purchased a model with a full-sized HDMI port on the back but I wanted at least a NUC5i3 model, and the NUC6i3 models are too expensive and seem to be having some reliability issues.

Each of the 14 I ordered was equipped with 8GB of Crucial DDR3L memory and a Samsung EVO 2.5in ssd (the M.2 version simply cost too much), and then attached to the rear of a 24in monitor. The end result is a very nice package that I am hopeful will last 5-7 years.

One wish: That I could have found a 6-12in length HDMI-to-miniDP cable. The shortest I could find was 3ft and that simply clutters up the back of the monitor/NUC combo.",
"Nice little device that cleanly replaces a traditional bulky and noisy mini-tower computer. I chose this particular NUC5I5MYHE model specifically because of the dual Mini Display Ports as all my computers have a dual 19"" 4:3 monitor configuration.

In addition to the base NUC unit, I purchased the Crucial 8Gb RAM kit (4GBx2 DDR3 1600 MT/s PC3 - 12800 CL11 SODIMM CT2KIT51264BF160B), a Samsung SSD (Samsung 850 EVO 250 GB M.2 MZ-N5E250BW) and Bluetooth/WiFi combo module (Intel 7265). Installation of these components wasn't difficult, especially if you have smaller hands. The one problem I ran into was that the units antenna wires that connect to the BT/WiFI 7265 module kept popping off due to their rigidity and routing within the enclosure.

All said and done, the hardware (NUC+RAM+SSD+BT-WiFi module) cost $584 dollars (plus OS software of your choice) -- that isn't any less costly than a traditional desktop (mini tower) computer, so you should only consider the NUC if you're looking for small form factor and quiet operation.

I chose to install Windows 7 64-bit. On the OS/software side, the only problem I encountered was that the Bluetooth driver and software stack wouldn't work properly with my Apple bluetooth keyboard and/or Microsoft bluetooth mouse -- not until I upgraded the BIOS. On a side note, finding the proper drivers and BIOS file are a bit of a pain with Intel's site -- Intel could really benefit by learning from other tech giants when it comes to implementing a simplified ""enter your device's model number or serial number and here are all the drivers and files you need"" approach.

On the plus side, the unit runs cool, quiet and the Intel i5 is fast enough for the non-gamer applications I use on a daily basis.

I do have a few criticisms of the hardware design:

The first and biggest concern of the device's design is that there aren't enough USB ports. There are only two on the back and two on the front. I'd like to see at least four on the back for keyboard, mouse, scanner and cable to feed my monitor's integrated USB hub. The two ports on the front would then be sufficient for the occasional use of my external DVD and memory card reader.

Speaking of memory card reader, I've seen others post that it would be real nice to have a SD card slot integrated into the unit. I see this as a really nice to have, but not a need to have. For the $1.50 it would cost in parts, it would be nice to see it built in to future NUC units.

Also, why Intel located the audio output jack on the front of the unit doesn't make a lot of sense to me. Why isn't this on the back like a normal computer so that I can route and hide all my cables?

Lastly, the design of the power supply leaves a bit to be desired. The connector to the NUC is not locking, and for reason's unknown, the barrel connector is a right angle which doesn't make a lot of sense given that all other cables (USB, Enternet, display ports) exit straight out the back. More importantly, the 'brick' plugs directly to your outlet, rather than with a lead cable -- for me this was also a problem as my power strip will no longer fit under my desk with the NUC's power brick attached.

All-in-all, I'd buy one again and would recommend these to peers -- but I'd make sure the limitations outlined above wouldn't be a problem first.",
"Surprisingly when I opened up the bottom cover my NUC had been fitted with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB M.2 SATA hard drive. I purchased the NUC 5 Pro series as a bare bones PC. Normally this means I would need to add Storage and memory (RAM). The options for storage M.2 SATA (B key) socket and a standard SATA socket and space for 2.5"" SSD.  I messaged the company because I felt it was the right thing to do and offered to exchange it for what I had payed for. They emailed me back and thanked me for letting them know but told me I could keep it. So I purchased a used barebones NUC 5 Pro for $175 and ended up getting a well built complete system. The new price without the RAM and storage is $499. You add in the price of buying the RAM and memory which that's another $130. So yes I am very happy.  The product it's self  didn't look used it came with the peel off plastic protection on top and the front buttons. There where no scratches or marks of any kind and the it operates well. The only thing I would like to see included is a mini DisplayPort cable or adapter. That is the only outputs. I ended up purchasing  a mini DisplayPort to HDMI adapter from the local Best Buy  for about $9 just so I could get it up and running and test it. Otherwise I have no complaints. Of course I thrilled that I got more than I ordered but the product itself is like new and does what it's supposed to do. It cam with the power cord and metal mounting bracket, as well as all the original paperwork that would come in a new boxed item. Then when I contacted the sellers they were quick to respond and seemed very kind. What more could someone ask for. I would have written the same kind of review if I had gotten just the product as I had ordered it because of it's quality.",
"I'm a retired computer engineer, but it doesn't take one to see their design is flawed and their science is wrong. Look at the photo I posted of theirs. The back fan is the only one I can tell is correctly setup.
1) your front 3 case find should ALWAYS be setup facing inward. Meaning they are all blowing fresh cool air into your case and over your motherboard and components.

2) if you can, ALWAYS, mount your AIO liquid cooler radiator on the top of your case. (And here is where they messed up, they aren't creating a negative or positive pressure system, air will just find its way out of any tiny openeings) the way this is set up you will need your fans running at 100% just to fight against each other.
After mounting your radiator to the ceiling you then mount your 3 fans for a 360mm so that the fans are blowing air through the radiator and out the top.
3) Doing it this way cool air will.be brought into your case from the front 3 fans,, as the air passed over your motherboard and videocard its going to begin to warm up as it cools down your components. What does warm air do naturally? Warn air rises. Which is why you have your radiator fans set to pull that warm air up and through the radiator cooling the radiator down and then it's really gonna be warm air. Do you want that hot air being sucked into your case and blown over your motherboard? NO, that one exhaust fan in the back will have to work on 100% just like all the others as the fans fight each other against air pressure and gravity.

It's very simple when building a PC. Hot air always rises. Your radiator is going to get warm but not scalding hot. But you don't want any of the hot air from your radiator going back into your case, do you? I'd you do just get rid of the water cooler and put a fan on your cpu and let it blow hot air all over everything.
The warm air coming off the radiator will rise out the tip of your case on its own. That's why you attatch 3 fans to the bottom of it and have the fans blowing air UP not DOWN like these people have it doing.

The 3 fans will pull any air in your case that's warm and push it through your radiator and out the top of your case. The rear case fan is to help blow any left over warm air out of the case as well and to help pull the air blown in from your front fans right towards rhe radiator fans as it warms up when it cools your ram etc. Whatever warm air doesn't get blown out the top of your case will exhaust out the rear of your case.
That's how you set up proper cooling for your gaming pc.",
"Excellent. The MEK Hero G1 A5837 met or exceeded my expectations. First it was well packed, with a large foam insert protecting the graphics card so it didn't get banged around during shipping. It started right up. Windows said it wasn't activated and it wasn't obvious how to do that, so a quick email to support resulted in a fast reply giving me the command to find the Windows product key which worked with activation.

The keys to a gaming machine are making sure it doesn't overheat but that cooling it doesn't generate a ton of fan noise. The Mek has eight fans in it - three at the front, one at the back, as well as two on the graphics card and two on the CPU liquid cooler. I've monitored temperatures during gameplay and GPU and all CPU cores run cool, maxing out at no more than 70C. The fans are relatively quiet and not noticeable above the usual volume of gameplay. So excellent cooling with low noise.

For expansion there are two open DIMM slots and two open PCIE slots, although one of them would put a PCIE card very close to the graphics card fan so it may not be the best choice.

The only minor con I've noticed is although there are a ton of USB ports, there is no USB C. This is a nit because USB A to C cables are readily available. Also it would be possible to add a cheap PCIE USB C card if necessary.

In summary I'm delighted with the Mek, and my one minor interaction with their support team was positive.",
"All in all the computer performs well but for how long is anybody's guess. When I received the product it would not turn on, in addition no user manuals are provided.  I had to log onto my desk top to try and figure out what was wrong with it, after being on the phone with Dell support for about an hour and searching for trouble code beeps on my desk top it was determined the memory cards were not seated properly.  Dell was helpful in walking me through removing the back cover of the lap top and re-seating the memory chips, I had to do it twice but then the computer started to function.  Needless to say I was less than enamored having to go through all that.  I found it unbelievable the a new computer would have no user guide and I am far what one would consider tech savvy, so I really feel sorry for individuals that receive this product in this condition because you shouldn't have to take your new computer apart before you can start using it. In addition the computer just does not seem to be put together solid at all.",
"I bought this laptop almost a year ago (February 2016) and it was great for a while. I don't abuse my electronics, in fact I used this maybe 2-3 times a week tops so it didn't get very heavy use at all. About 6 months in, I noticed a white line on the screen, similar to what you'd see if there was moisture damage. I only ever used this at home either in my bedroom or my living room, it was never near any source of moisture, and when I wasn't using it I kept it in a laptop case. It wasn't a huge issue since it didn't interfere with my usage of the laptop, but sill annoying. Now fast forward to about two weeks ago, when suddenly I get a message that the charger is plugged in, but not charging the laptop. Also the charger cable seemed a little loose, so I just assumed it was the charger going prematurely bad. I bought another charger, and to my disappointment got the same message, so it's obviously the laptop itself. I'm very disappointed that this thing lasted less than a year of less than moderate use. I have always loved Dell products, but this one was a major dud. What a waste of $400 :(",
"First I would like to say that I do PC repair and networking for a living and deal with computers and Windows operating systems on a daily basis so I am very aware of what I am doing. Soooo where do I start with this one... ok, so out of the box and first power up I notice a yellowy area at the top right of the screen all during boot and when the desktop comes up. To not see it you have to change the background to something in that color range. Then, upon trying to hook up any sort of audio device, headphones or speakers, it wouldn't recognize them and would play through the laptop speakers anyway or would output to external speakers (never the headphones) with a loud buzzing/humming noise. I adjusted every possible audio configuration in the computer to try to get it to output to the externals, I updated and installed drivers, I checked the config of the built in Dell audio software and it was all fine. So, defective lcd, defective audio in/out. I proved this by connecting the laptop to a docking station and connected the same speakers and headphones through that to a usb port on the laptop (surprisingly not defective also...) and they worked exactly as they should've. Not even going to the bother of sending it back and trying for a new one, because I'm sure half of it won't work either. So I'll be fixing this one myself. Quite disappointed.",
"I needed a laptop that was reliable for school, that could replace our old laptop when it goes, and that was also affordable. This is the third one I purchased. The first one (different company/brand) had to be returned because the mouse would freeze and then ultimately got the blue screen of death within 2 weeks after having barely used it (purchased online). The second one (also a different company/brand) wouldn't connect to the internet which I found to be a common problem with the model, so I had to return that one as well (purchased in a store). I couldn't find another laptop that was affordable in a store, but I was also hesitant to purchase online again, but I found this one. I've had it for almost a month now and have zero complaints. The speed on it is great. Everything seems to run smoothly with absolutely no problems. I'm not a huge fan of the touch mouse pad - I think I'd prefer a wireless instead, but I don't really think my preference for the mouse is enough to subtract my overall rating. I'd recommend it.",
"I am really really really happy with this purchase, for $488... This computer runs as good as my wife's Macbook Pro. It is silent, no loud fan, no lag no junk. One plus - being a ""Signature"" edition, there is no bloatware installed. Windows 10 is running great, and my transition (file transfer) was a breeze, just connect a network cable between the two computers and transfer away. Check YouTube for a how to. I only wish is that MS Office was included I really need it - I don't have the money for that right now.

I've been around computers for more than 20 years -If your looking for s laptop in the $500 range, you cant go wrong with this one. I was looking at and compared several other brands but decided on this i5558-578SLV because of the graphics, processor (although not the latest i5 by year) configured memory and HDD size. Asus, Lenovo couldn't match my requirements and the out the door price. If you are considering a laptop better hit the Amazon check out and get it. Don't forget MS office - I have to use my old computer till I can afford it. http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/pdp/Office-Home-Student-2016/productID.323023200?ICID=All_Office_ModO_HS16",
"The computer itself was not bad, although I didn't have much time to evaluate it before the screen had broke while being in a laptop case, unsure the exact cause.  However Dell said if I sent it in for repairs it would cost me $261.00 plus shipping fees to replace the touch screen, because it was not an 'act of god'.  I didn't know what caused it, so it had to of been though...right?  Anyway,  because of my honesty of the screen breaking following his 'up sale' attempt at the start of our conversation, n he could no longer offer me the warranty that covered accidental damage as I had stated it was already broken.  Also had more issues with dell a year later when I discovered I could in fact still use the computer streamed to my tv using hdmi ( I had asked another dell agent how to do just that, and the tech guy told me it was impossible to setup without a working screen) .  However dell rep refused to give me the BIOS bypass code because I was past my original 1 year warranty unless I purchased another warranty plan for my laptop.

Summarized,  Call Acer if you have any technical problems and if you dont get accidental forgiveness as part of your warranty.. skip it completely!!
Since the 1 year warranty came with with my order of this laptop, I believe I am allowed to voice my experience on the products review as I am.",
"This is a nice computer with one big flaw, IMO. Because the number keys are placed to the right of the rest of the keys, they changed the center of the layout. The camera is placed at the screen's center but the keys are laid out with the touchpad to the left of center. I hate this design. I cannot naturally find my finger placement for the keys and have to look for placement every time I move my hand for the mouse. The keys are more flush than my last Dell which also makes it harder to feel the correct finger placement. So, for normal typing, the center of the keyboard is to the left of the screen and bottom platform. It is extremely frustrating and causes me to regularly type the wrong keys, grrrr. I hope this description makes since. I simply find the bottom platform and keyboard to be a very poor design for me.
I have deducted 2 stars because not easily finding the correct keys, for a long time computer and keyboard user, is a major defect. I wish I had realised how long it would take to adjust to this layout issue. I would have exchanged it right away. Now, I'm stuck with it.",
"I researched for weeks to find a laptop under $500 and I am so happy to find this specific model! Personally the most important spec for a laptop is the screen quality, especially the resolution. This is 1920x1080 which is true HD. Many people posted in forums that you cannot tell the difference between 1366 x 768 vs 1920x1080. People can be seriously WRONG! The picture quality between these two resolution is night and day! Which 15in screen, do not go below 1920x1080. When I watch Youtube videos at 1080, the picture is very crisp and detailed.
It is hard to find a 1080 screen for laptops under $500. This is one of the very few on the market. This laptop has 1tb hard drive with 8gb of RAM, which has plenty of power to do every day tasks. Keep in mind that it is not a gaming laptop.
The one best single upgrade is to change the drive to solid state drive, which will load anything at a lightening speeds. Stick with quality brand names such as Samsung(which comes with very important software to copy your original data including Windows into the new SSD). You also need USB 3.0 to SATA III Hard Drive Adapter Cable which costs arond $10.
One of the best laptops under $500!",
"This is a great buy for all the features and specifications this laptop has.  It's hard to find anything comparable for this price that also has the same screen resolution as this computer.  All comparisons under $500 didn't have the same screen resolution, or sacrificed some other aspect, like chip, or HD space.  I was a little worried given the price but after using it a bit, it's a very sturdy, practical, do-everything computer.  Obviously because of the price there some tradeoffs.  For example it's not the lightest notebook in it's class, but it's certainly not heavy at all.  It's slim and you could easily take it places without much trouble.  The main tradeoff at this price is that you're buying a standard HD, not solid state which means the HD spins and consumes more power, thus battery life won't be as good if you're a chronic road warrior, but it will last at a coffee shop or during a flight on full charge, especially if you manage the power settings appropriately.  The laptop also isn't jammed with bloat software, which I really appreciated.  If you're looking for a great basic laptop that can handle high intensity programs, graphics editing, or video, and are on a budget, you could do no better.",
"I've been using this for over a week and haven't run into any major issues.  The only thing I'm not thrilled about is how onscreen text can sometimes have a fuzzy look depending on what you're browsing.  This may be an issue with the settings, or I didn't notice it on my old laptop that had a much lower resolution.

The speakers are crisp and loud and you can really turn headphones up on this thing.  Volume half way with only earbuds is fairly loud.  The keyboard is fantastic.  The keys have a great feel and I don't think I could be without an illuminated keyboard anymore.  All programs I've tried so far load fast and operate well, including Photoshop.  The touchscreen hasn't failed me yet although I don't plan on using it often.  It wasn't a selling feature for me but nice to have the option.  All ports and jacks are pretty tight and feel like they'll stand up to lots of use.

Overall I'm happy and will update in a couple months to see how it holds up.",
"Overall - good piece of equipment. I am very satisfied!
I have info pop-ups every time I start the laptop with the booting time and i takes usually about 16-25 seconds to start Windows. This is pretty fast, you don't have to wait forever for the system to launch.
Windows 10 is OK, but you have to get used to it first if you haven't used it before.
The screen itself is surprisingly big - I can easily watch movies or work with 2-3 files simultaneously. Love the fact that it's touchscreen, I was concerned at first that it might start to glitch with a course of time, but so far so good. You can just swipe through the long list or zoom in our out anything in a second. Very handy.
The keyboard is back lit, which is pretty neat. I think you have to pay like extra $30 in other models/brands if you want to enable this.
Maybe the only thing that I would change is USB - it has only 1 USD 3.0 and 2 - 2.0. Personally, I don't see why they didn't installed all three 3.0, but that doesn't bother me that much. It is somewhat frustrating, since I do use devices which call for USB 3.0 and here I can't use them simultaneously, but once again - can't say that this is such a big deal... Can live with that.
Highly recommend. I doubt that you'll be able to find similar specs for this price.",
"Nice laptop at a decent price.  As others have said, the keyboard and casing feels really cheap to the touch, the hood of the lid is thin and hollow it would seem as it gives very easily to the lightest touch (feels thin like milk jug plastic), and the keyboard is bowed slightly (like a photo that is too large for its frame seat and bows upwards) but as a laptop, it's good.  It zips along nicely.  Just came from a Lenovo that got me to a point that I want to smash it on the shop floor.  So, having a good responsive laptop again makes me very happy.  Only had it 2 days so far, but set-up was fairly easy (took some time to load up all the programs and apps I need; like office, box, amazon, etc, but that is normal.  One thing of note, have not been able to get the printers to add-on successfully.  They load up, show as ready, then no printing.  Have tried two HP color Laser Jet, and one Canon Ink Jet thus far.  I will update as I figure this out).  It boots fairly quickly and multitasks very well.  4 stars only because of the paper thin plastics used for the casing and keyboard.",
"Want to waste $500 and hours of your time, then buy this computer.  I bought this computer because I had always heard good things about Dell and this computer was reasonably priced.  The issues started as soon as i fired it up the first time.  The computer would not stay connected to the internet when using Wifi.  It would connect for a couple minutes and then somehow magically disconnect on its own.  The only way to reconnect was to disconnect in the connection center and then reconnect manually.  When we contacted Dell tech support they were adamant it was our Wifi equipment even though all of our other wireless devices connected without issue.  When they finally agreed to send it in for service it took weeks for them to process the order only to return it in exactly the same condition.  This was the first time I sent it in.

The computer seemed to work for about a week when I got it back but  then it started to have the same issues.  We contacted tech support again and they tried all the same ""corrective actions"" they tried the first time.  We spent hours on the phone with tech support trying everything to fix the issue.  The computer then started giving me the Blue Screen of Death, I didnt even know that was a thing anymore but there it was. We ended up sending it in again to get repaired. Again, it took weeks to ""fix""

When we fired up the computer this time, not only did the computer yet again fail to stay connected to Wifi, the audio jack no longer worked.  Again, after hours on the phone with tech support and them trying pointlessly to fix this remotely we were getting ready to just accept that we bought a piece of garbage and just deal with it.  That was until something failed internally on the computer and now it constantly beeps loudly and it cannot be stopped.  5 beeps over and over and over.  Wont stop.  I contacted dell and said I have had enough after almost a year of broken equipment, hours and hours on the phone with tech support and months of waiting for the computer to get back from their repairs, I finally had enough and requested a refund for what obviously is a piece of junk product and inept tech support.  Dell said they will not refund and again only offered to ""fix"" the computer again.

The one thing that Dell does great is give you the run around.  They will transfer you from customer support to tech support to the warranty department and then right back to customer support.  Rinse and repeat over and over and over.

Save yourself a a huge headache.  Do not buy this Computer, in fact, i wouldn't recommend an Dell computers unless your looking for some sort of boat anchor.",
"I've had this laptop for about a week now and I haven't really touched my desktop since. The display is gorgeous . Unlike some of the others I haven't had any bleed in the corners. We use Kodi in my house for media I installed kodi and am able to easily watch everything on our NAS with ease, 1080p content looks great on it.

The laptop was up and running within a few minutes. The back-lit keyboard is nice as I spend a bit a time using it in bed after the hubby has went to sleep, so it's nice to be able to see what I'm doing instead of needing another light..

The touchpad is ok, but I don't really use it, I've always detested touchpads so I purchased a wireless mouse to go with this, and use it instead.

The touch screen is a nice addition though I suppose I could live without it if there wasn't one.

This laptop is not a gaming powerhouse, however I am able to easily use steam to stream any of the MMO's I play from my main gaming computer, it does handle that with ease. I might handle games better with a bit more memory than what it comes with, however I've not installed any, though from reading other reviews I see it is possible to take it up to 16 gigs instead of the 8 gigs it comes with.

This laptop is perfect for browsing the internet, using Microsoft office and watching and/or streaming media. It does all of those things extremely well.

I skipped windows 8 and honestly I'm glad I did I think it would've soured my experience with Windows 10, which I actually (surprisingly to myself) really like.",
"I have had this computer for a year now and the warranty is now expired.
PROS:
Back-lit keys
Nice touchpad and touchscreen
Good speakers
HDMI and 3.0

CONS:
Weak processor that isn't what was advertised
Cheap, easily broken DVD drive
Poor drivers for Windows 10
Charger broke before 12 months

Overall this computer has been a pain to own and I would not repurchase. It has a few good points, I like the back-lit keyboard even though there's this slight weird bulge in the middle of the laptop there, it doesn't bother me personally but its there fyi. I think the touchpad is nice and decently big, actually really liked where they put the speakers. They are on the front of the laptop and I feel like it does a good job of projecting the sound out, especially when its sitting on a table. Much better than if they were on the bottom like a lot of other computers. The sound of the laptop is pretty decent in general.
But that's about where my compliments about the computer end. Right out of the box it was really slow and laggy and the video driver would crash all the time. I called Dell a few times and they tried to help but mostly would just try things that didn't work for hours and then give up and tell me they were done and to call back if anything else happened. The video driver Dell makes for the integrated graphics on Windows 10 is not very compatible. Recently I have downgraded to Windows 7 and it is noticeably better, but I am noticing more how much of it is the fault of a weak processor. It still lags a bit more when surfing the web and moderate stuff like that than I think is normal. Which led me to notice that this computer is telling me it has a weaker processor than they advertised it as. This computer has an i5-4210U 1.70GHz 2.40GHz, when Amazon has it listed as i5-4210U 2.20GHz 2.70GHz. I wish I had noticed sooner and would have returned, because I feel like its too slow honestly. I had to replace the charger before I even owned it a year, so that's one thing. The last major problem I have had with it is that the disk drive has never worked on this laptop. I didn't try to use it until after months of owning it but it wouldn't read disks and no amount of troubleshooting did anything. So Dell sent me a new one to install myself and I did easily, but the very first time I went to use it I put the disk in and then it never came back out and makes this horrible noise now when you puch the button to open the tray. They refused to send another and told me I had to package the computer with my own box and send it to them so I never got it fixed. I would maybe consider utilizing the space with a better hard drive if it did not have such a weak processor. I would get rid of it, but I am required to buy a Macbook for the school I'm transferring to so I can just keep this as extra storage and to watch Netflix. I doubt it would get anything for it if I sold it anyway.",
"Five years ago I spent three times as much to buy my wife a Dell laptop that has less than half the capabilities of this unit.  It is amazing how quickly technology has improved and prices have come down.  After doing a ton of research, which is normal for me, I settled on this unit to handle
all of my computing needs while on the go.  It appears that I made a wise choice!

I am not a ""gamer"" nor do I multitask or use spreadsheets, therefore my needs might be quite a bit less than  yours.  On the other hand, I always try to get a bit more product than I really need to hedge myself for potential applications in the future. My emphasis is on reliability, efficiency, and portability.

Every Dell computer I've ever owned has always performed as promised. In fact, the only other manufacturer I've tried is Gateway (once) and their product was also well made.  Any problems I've encountered over the years have either been caused by my own inexperience and/or could be
rectified by a quick call to Dell Customer Support.  The performance and efficiency of this computer is limited only by the quality of the wi-fi available.  The slight delays and pauses of some wi-fi connections can be maddening but are not the fault of the computer.

As far as portability, this is far lighter and thinner than my wife's prior Dell 15.6"" laptop. I considered a smaller screen but my older eyes appreciate a larger screen and carrying this unit around with you is simple if you use the Amazon Basics Laptop sleeve.  Anything larger than an iphone 6+ requires something other than a pocket to transport it so it's really not a hardship to have a larger screen to carry.

The product description will provide you with all the information you need concerning storage, speed, ports, and functions.  The screen is exceptionally clear, the sound is acceptable (use headphones for best performance) the keyboard is familiar, has the right haptic feel (for me) and is backlit for easier night time use. The unit overall looks well made and is strongly and attractively constructed.  It is everything that you have come to expect from a Dell computer.",
"The worst laptop I've ever encountered.  Hardware is so cheap and brittle that it begins falling apart from top to bottom within a year.  THIS IS A DISPOSABLE LAPTOP.  Failure begins quickly and accelerates from there.

1.  Space Key Nonfunctional:  The space key is incredibly unresponsive.  I'm a touch-typist.  With the Inspirion, I type a paragraph, then find half the words ran together because the space key didn't work.  Not a problem with any other computer I've ever used.

2.  Touchpad:  The touchpad on the Inspiron is one of those unified pieces with both the right-click and left-click buttons integrated into a single unit.  This frequently results in right-clicking when you meant to left-click.  It also takes major effort to do the click -- probably twice as much pressure as old Lenovo G50.  A set-up for repetitive stress injury, particularly tendonitis of the elbow.  (Ask me how I know.)

3.  Windows 10:  No improvement over the functionality of Windows XP or Windows 7.

4.  Processing Speed:  Good.  The Intel I5 processor is fast -- the only good part of the Inspirion.

5.  Screen:  The screen is bright and clear.  The touchscreen function works, although it has one enormous defect (see below).

6.  Wifi Connection:  Weak!  I can't go far from my Wifi router with the Inspirion.  The Wifi connection simply cuts out at distances where my other devices have no problem maintaining a connection.

7.  Touchscreen Defect:  The frame around the touchscreen is so thin and fragile that if you apply even slight pressure to the upper right hand corner of the frame, it will depress the ""X"" on an open Internet window and close out your browser.

I gave the Inspirion one star because of the nonfunctional space key and injury-inducing touchpad.  These defects taint every interaction I have with the laptop.

Update 1/1/2017:  After many months with the Inspirion, my experience has gotten worse.  There is now a weird glitch where the icons in the lower right hand corner of the screen (sound, power, wifi signal, time and date) start flashing in and out, the cursor goes haywire, and the touchscreen acts like I'm pressing it in random places even though my hands are still on the keyboard.  The haywire cursor will even close me out of open browser sessions involuntarily.

I am current on updates from Microsoft and my Norton security scans show no viruses.  This appears to be a glitch unique to the Inspirion.  I am pretty sure I will never purchase another Dell product.  This Inspirion has been a huge disappointment.

Update 2/14/2017:  Just when I thought this laptop couldn't get worse....

1.  Now the adapter plug (the part that inserts into the laptop) has become so loose that it randomly loses the electrical connection and stops charging while inserted.  I think it's charging, only to find the battery has run down.  ARGH!

2.  Windows 10 glitches the printer drivers for my HP printer.  When I print a document, a ""ghost"" of the document remains stuck in the queue with an error message, preventing anything else from printing.  Sometimes Windows lets me delete the document, but most of the time it either won't delete at all or takes 30 minutes or so to delete.  Now, routine printing of multiple documents is an enormous hassle.  (And it's not the drivers -- I've re-downloaded them directly from HP.

Update 6/12/17:  Two new problems:

1.  Brittle Frame:  The plastic from which the bottom frame is made is so flimsy and brittle that the lower left hand corner is cracking around the USB ports.  I haven't dropped the machine or done anything rough with it.  The frame is simply falling apart from normal, gentle use.

2.  Display Cable Defect:  The screen often flashes vertical colored lines for extended periods, rendering it useless.  I've read that this machine has defective display cables that cause this problem.  I've attached clamps on both sides of the screen because depressing those areas seems to help.  But what a RIDICULOUS thing to have to do to a laptop that is less than two years old!

Update 7/31/17:  The HDMI port is no longer working.  I insert the HDMI cable for my second screen and get ... blackness.  It usually lasts a couple of minutes, then the screen will start flashing on and off or give me a ""no signal input"" message.  Eventually, the connection somehow stabilizes and I get a normal screen.

There is literally nothing hardware-related that has not gone wrong with this laptop.  It is the crappiest computer I've ever seen, much less owned.

*****I CAN'T SAY IT ANY MORE STRONGLY:  DON'T BUY THIS LAPTOP.  DON'T BUY THIS LAPTOP.  DON'T BUY THIS LAPTOP.****",
"I've had this computer for nearly 4 years now and I've gotten very close with it in that time. It isn't the best for gaming, I can't even run a few games on the lowest quality settings. The screen is high quality, but you will notice bright spots around the edges when the screen is dark but still in use. The touch screen had this problem where it would activate with nothing touching it so I just turned it off permanently. The track pad is responsive and works very well, and the keyboard is back lit and sensitive. The battery on my laptop randomly started malfunctioning and did not hold a charge and any time it was plugged into the computer it would freak out and start flashing lights rapidly. There is a small spot where some pixels have died but I cannot even see it unless the screen is totally dark. A screw stripped out of its hole and I have to tape my laptop together on the corner where the hinge is because of that. Not a lot of RAM, and the CPU gets used up pretty quickly, but it is still a fast and reliable computer with a great value for its price point and I use it every day. Perfect if you want a laptop that will run low-intensity games that don't require a good graphics card. The Sims 4 works fine on low settings, OSU plays well- with occasional lag, some games are for some reason nearly unplayable if they access the internet to load up (steam games) which I experienced with Firewatch and The Long Dark. Even despite my issues with the laptop I really do love and am happy with my purchase and see myself continuing to use it for several more years to come!",
"First of all, this is a GREAT computer.  It's only hampered by running Windows 10, which CONSTANTLY is updating, and on the traditional disk drive here, it's very slow for updates.  The drive is 1 TB, so there's tons of space.  But it's so slow that it takes hours to manage Windows updates.  And that's not even mentioning that some Windows updates in the past have caused massive problems like lost files, never to be recovered.  It's very strange.  If this were a Chromebook, it would be a beast.  But I got it for the DVD/CD thing to transfer files from DVD/CD and to play games.  It actually can play games.  I ran Fallout 3 at around 30 FPS.  Sometimes dipping to 20s, but I certainly could play the game and have fun - it was similar to a Playstation 3 experience of the game.  So it can do that.  The display is fantastic and I never used the touch screen.  Also, the keyboard is the worst keyboard I have ever used in my life.",
"I have purchased two dozen computers or more in the past two decades but this one is right up there with the very best of them.

It took me a month to decide on a new computer for a new business I am launching and I decided that, short of switching to Apple, Dell has the best reviews in laptops.

The price was unbelievable, this model has everything I wanted and no bloat-ware (so happy never to see McAfee again, ever!). I especially love the action on the keyboard. The entire surface is some sort of velvety rubber-like material that is comfortable and does not show fingerprints. The keys have the right amount of firm ""crunch"", and the backlit feature works beautifully. I don't mind it going off to conserve energy -- the minute you touch any key, it comes back. Genius.

The outer shell is beautiful too with a corduroy-like finish that will resist marks and scratches. The whole unit feels substantial for a laptop (and I have had many that were either too heavy or too flimsy, in the past).

Setup was effortless. Literally plug and play simple. I am no techie and really appreciated that. It did take some effort to find the place to register (I just went to the Dell main page and found it there), and I think that should be more evident in the apps or somewhere more intuitive, but that was the only drawback to getting the unit up and running.

With a few keystrokes, I synced it to my other Windows Desktops and now I can move to any of them and work seamlessly.

With one Terabyte of HD, I can download beefy software and keep data on a thumb-drive. The RAM is perfect and the processor enables fast loading of sites and software.

The best for last: I do a lot of artistic photography work and the resolution on this computer is exceptional. Brilliant, beautiful screen display. I don't find the gloss finish distracting nor is there too much glare, so I don't intend to add a filter over it.

The perfect computer. Let's face it, we don't hold onto computers for a decade any more. Most of us have to get new ones at least every few years. However, this one seems destined to last for more than most and I can see already that I will be quite attached to it.",
"As a long-time Mac user and a very, very reluctant Windows user, I have to say I could almost switch back to Windows based on my experience with  this Dell laptop. I was a bit worried as the whole sum of instructions consists of a five panel pamphlet about the size of a CD and mostly pictures and not words. As I was girding myself for the interminable suffering of online search for anticipated help needs because it's Windows, and rearranging my schedule in my head to carve out the time, this little Dell quietly finished the set-up and was ready to begin. Dell really did their homework and made this crazy easy right out of the box.

This laptop comes pre-installed with Windows 10, which for many may be a deal-breaker, but I found I was able to get going and navigate around the OS immediately and with extreme ease. Having read the reviews and rants, and this being my first go-around with Windows 10, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it. I easily installed some apps, got them onto the task bar and home screen (or whatever it's called) and once the housekeeping was done (connecting to the WiFi network, printers, other devices, etc.), I was off and running.

The keyboard is just the right set of responsiveness, not too touchy nor does it require a firm press. And for a laptop, the keys are spaced well enough for my hands. Someone with large hands may find it too cramped, but hey, it's a laptop and you can always plug in an external keyboard.

It's lightweight and slim enough to easily tote around all day, and indeed it did not become a horrible burden on my shoulder during a recent business trip. It starts up quickly, runs smoothly and quietly. The built-in speakers are pretty decent and getting the laptop to pair via bluetooth was a snap (like it is on the Mac). The screen is gorgeous, truly gorgeous. I was bowled over at the crisp clarity and brilliance of color. In the hotel room I really put it to the test (you know, that horrible laggy hotel Internet speed) and watched an episode of a show through Amazon Prime and whoa, it was like watching a high quality HD TV. Yes, there was some lag because I refuse to pay the $20 per day for the ""premium"" Internet service, but nowhere near as bad as with my older Mac laptop. The next day as I whisked through a PowerPoint presentation, several people caught the view from my screen and almost immediately the meeting went from an artfully arranged agenda to playtime with my new Dell. After fawning all over it, the price tag question came up and upon learning the price, everyone went nuts.

There are plenty of really good reviews about the technical specs, but if you are looking for a solid laptop for business and/or student use, this is an amazing value!! I still love my Mac, but my little Dell has earned a coveted spot on my desk too!",
"1 Star. Ok quality, can't change default function keys, it ran at max temp for the first month, and now 2 months later the touchscreen has errors and registers several not real inputs, then shuts down, depending on screen position. Will not buy another. Will not recommend MSI products. Used only lightly for personal home / streaming use.

8 month Update. Over all needed to return 3 times for touchscreen issues, each time being repaired, then lasting ~2 months before failing again. After the third failure I received a new unit, (different S/N) to which I am going to sell second hand as NIB. Quality of the device was over all ok for ~$1400. Still the device runs hot, uncomfortably on a lap. Speakers are worse then my 10yr old Lenovo Yoga, and the battery life while browsing and streaming is good for ~5 hrs. Overall disappointed, but I will raise to 2 stars as the exchanges and returns for warranty where very easy, and MSI covered it all no questions asked, usually only taking 6-8 days.",
"We bought this laptop back in November of 2022, and go figure it breaks just after the one year warranty expires!

This laptop was pretty nice for what it packed into a small package.  Sweet features with the touchscreen, fingerprint unlock, 32gb RAM.  But it just did not last.  We used this laptop lightly for travel/personal use and never abused it.
It started having an issue where the mouse pointer would jump to a certain spot on the screen, and then dance back and forth.  The pointer changing to a sort of crosshair look.  This problem started to happen more and more frequently and now the laptop cannot be used for more than 2-3 minutes without it happening.  Tried various forms of troubleshooting and after finally taking it in the problem is apparently the motherboard.  MSI offered to fix it... for more than the cost of the entire laptop.  This has been extremely disappointing as the issue is from the parts used to build this machine and MSI wont take any responsibility for it because the warranty just expired.

Overall this experience has decidedly made us unlikely to ever purchase an MSI product again.",
"Bought my first Asus laptop in January 2012, and it has served me well. I still have it and everything still works, but it likely needs a new battery (only stays on when plugged in), and is running Windows 7 so I figured it was time to finally upgrade. It still starts up in under 30 second, runs quick, and does all I need it to do, but having to tape the cord to the port is a little too far in the trenches for me. Hahaha!! Although I am getting a warranty extension for submitting this review, it is definitely not in any way motivated by the incentive, as I had already made up my mind that it was going to be Asus or nothing when I started my search. The laptop is BEAUTIFUL! The screen is a great size at 16"", and it is so slim that carrying it around all day is no biggie. I am a real estate agent so being able to work on the go is essential (one of the reasons I knew I needed to upgrade), and this checks all the boxes. Harmon Kardon speakers give great quality sound while I'm listening to my music and the speed makes my daily work tasks a breeze. The ONLY thing I don't like is the placement of the 0 on the 10-key numeric pad, but that is something that can easily be forgotten once I get used to using it more. Since I bought my original Asus in 2012, my siblings and parents have gone through 2 Macbooks, 2 Chromebooks, and a Lenovo that have all conked out after a few short years (I don't think any of them made it to their 5th birthday. haha!). The price is definitely nothing to wince at, and luckily I caught it on sale, but remember that YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR. A $300 computer may seem like the way to go, but why do that to yourself when you'll be back in 3 years looking for a replacement? Asus has stood the test of time and I will not ever purchase any other brand. To me, they are truly top tier. Don't just buy a laptop; INVEST in one...THIS one!",
"A little difficult to get started as the apps didn't seem to want to download through their installed program and I kept getting an error message hen trying to sign on to the amazon mall for applications which this went on for days, more like weeks. At this time I have not yet tried to install through the computer or go any further. I've simply stopped after reading the troubleshooting for installing app which involves checking some settings and what not.

Otherwise the product seems nice. Best for probably ages 3 or 4 and up. Those who can follow instructions and are closer to understanding and mastering preschool teachings and concepts. Not as much protection as you may expect or want when paying such for a little ones entertainment so I would recommend buying any additional case/cover or whatever you can (don't forget the screen protector).

Not a big choice in colors but we got the bluish teal and it's mostly a pretty summer bright ocean aqua, mixed right down the middle, not more blue not more green but nice and better for a girl I think but we got for a boy. Still nice.

I think once I get the applications on it will be fine. My son is only 2 and doesn't use it very well but can still color/draw and play silly games like the Ant Smasher. Of course if I wasn't having problems installing apps I could tell you what else is there but since it uses Android you can just search here through Amazon for apps. I LOVE Android ad will stay with them.

So overall I would recommend this. Even my 7 year old enjoys it. Games for all ages... including adults!! ??",
"Anyone considering this tablet needs to know that this is the VERY FIRST version of the Funtab. There has been a Funtab 2 and the newest is the Funtab 3. This first version is very inferior to the new Funtab 3. And guess what, it costs $30 to $40 more! This very outdated version only has Android 4.2 and a very small 8GB of storage. And the newer Funtab 3 has Google Play Store which is FAR superior to the very limited Amazon App store that charges money for many of the same apps on GPS that are FREE. The newer F3 has Android 5.1 which is a much more efficient operating system that gives longer battery life for one thing. It also has twice as much storage at 16GB. So you can add a lot more free games from Google Play Store. Not that you'll even need to for a long time. This tablet has SO many great games your kid will be entertained for many months. And not just entertained, but LEARNING. Nearly every game on this tablet teaches something valuable. As a tablet seller for many years I can highly recommend this tablet (Funtab 3) as the best tablet on the market for ages 2-5. Even better than a Leapfrog? Yep! Leapfrog is great for ages 3-9. But for strictly preschool kids nothing beats this tablet. It's a steal at $50-$60. But do yourself a favor and buy it brand new, not used or refurbished. The price difference is only about 5 or 10 bucks. Many tablet dealers sell used or refurbished that are actually store returns and all you're getting are someone else's problems. Two other tips.....get a screen protector right away. You need all the protection you can get with kids. And don't let kids charge it. They'll ruin the delicate charging port. If it stops charging, first thing is try a new USB cable. At least half the time that's the problem. And if you happen to get a bad tablet make sure you exchange it for another right away. Remember....Funtab 3.",
"A month ago I bought this lenovo ideapad laptop it was working just fine for the 3 weeks... but after  a night of work ( I bough it so I can work from home ) I tried to turn it on the next day  and it would not ....  Tried connecting it with the charger but it would charge or turn on ... After talking with Lenovo they suggested it was static that build in the battery , so i disconnected the main and the cmos  battery and press the power button for a minute so the static would disappear.... But nothing work... After that it came to my knowledge that the mother board just died over night ... The computer had a month in my hands so amazon would not take it back ... Lenovo will not help either so I'm sitting here with no tools to work , 500 plus $ less in my account and a laptop that was nearly used only for Microsoft word... I would really recommend to stay away from lenovo since it seems dead mother board is a trend among them ....",
"Sadly, I've been through two of these devices and arrived at the same results: Asus has not designed the entire device to meet the needs of the separate components and perform to expectations.

1. CPU is both underpowered at 80W PL2 vs Intel's required 115W to achieve 4.7Ghz AND under-cooled causing the processor package to reach 95C at a mere 4.2Ghz and throttle down to 3.8Ghz or lower each time due to poor cooling system thermodynamics. Meaning: as tested, this laptop performs in the bottom 8th percentile of all other laptops with the same CPU across more than 1000 tests.

2. The RAM is timed with a very high latency. As configured and tested, the LPDDR5 16GB memory package performs slower than 5 year old DDR4 memory. Samsung supports XMP 3 for their DDR5 with better timings and latency, but Asus has chosen to not implement to specifications again, resulting in poor memory performance.

3. The A370m GPU leaves much to be desired. In short, it will aid low demand creative applications but you can forget about 3D gaming and demanding creative suites.

Aside from that, the screen is beautiful and bright, SSD performance is up to mark, keyboard is nice for a laptop/notebook, and the battery is great.

In general, there are a handful of choices with the same or better specs that outperform this model. Asus has impressed us with the specifications but tricked us with the reality of experience and performance.

Buy something else...",
"The laptop survived traveling halfway around the world. Thank you for packing it properly. It reached southeast asia safely.

At first i thought the laptop was D.O.A. It won't turn on. It turns out the battery was drained. Charging it fixed the problem. Windows estimate the battery will last for 8hrs. Under light use.

It came with windows 10 pro. Upgraded it to windows 11.

Everything works except for the finger print scanner. I should have tested it on windows 10 before upgrading to window 11. Even linux mint 21.2 can't detect any finger print scanner installed. But it is ok with me. Not planning to use it any way.

Physically i think it is great just a few ballpen marks. A little scuff near a usb port. The laptop also came with a skin or sticker behind the screen. The skin is brushed aluminium.

To access bios spam f10 on boot.

I'm really happy with my purchase.

edit
read the description. there are no finger print scanner. just a heads up to potential buyers if they are after the finger print scanner",
"The laptop comes (mine at least) with pre-installed Windows 10 21H2. This is an out of support version of Windows 10 and is out of service for a couple of months.
More than that, the OS comes with a dozen of HP drivers missing for critical devices like wifi card. This means that out of the box there will be no network/internet connection once the computer is turned on. Of course it still has a RJ45 port, but I am sure that 90% of people don't have wired network at home. So you will have to download the required driver from HP site to another computer, copy it to a flash drive and then install it from the flash drive on the laptop. You have no idea which exactly driver you will need because on HP site there is driver for Intel wifi card, for MediaTek card and for Qualcomm card. You will need to try all of them in order to find the correct one. Once installed successfully, you can finally connect the laptop to the internet and download all the missing drivers and Windows updates. Note that before updates for Windows are installed, the computer is vulnerable due to very old version used as mentioned above. Well, I installed Windows 11 and it, BTW, has built in driver for the wifi card used in this computer.

And now the real problem. The battery is really worn out. The spec suggests capacity of 45Wh, but the actual capacity is 36Wh. This means that the battery is 20% less than a new one. Dear seller, this is not what I call _fully functional, and in excellent condition_. This is not properly tested and definitely not in excellent condition. I personally would prefer a couple of scratches to a worn out battery.

The good: the laptop is lightweight, good size for a kid's school computer and the screen is acceptable.

Addition: despite the description, the laptop does not have fingerprint sensor. I see that this was already stated in other reviews, but the vendor did not even update the item description. [Palmface]",
"I have used HP laptops for several years. I was looking for a replacement for a three year old model. A brand new version of what I got retails for around $1100. This refurbished unit was in perfect condition. It was supposed to have a fingerprint reader but I contacted the vendor and discovered that they had been misinformed. They rapidly rectified the issue in days with just a couple emails.

The computer itself was clean, the display is delightfully clear and bright. The AMD Ryzen CPU is more than twice as fast as the machine it replaces. It has run everything I need with plenty of headroom (typically running less than 6% CPU. The NvME SSD is blazing fast.) The 16 gigabytes of RAM is provided by two SoDIMM which allows dual-channel, interleaved access making it even a little faster. I've used it on an external monitor and gotten great 4K results at 60 Hertz. This was a great bargain. Plus, the vendor support was excellent.

I want to call out the specs on this again. AMD has an excellent line of CPUs and are comparable to Intel's latest generation. The construction of the ProBook follows the same frame design as the EliteBook which is the top of the line business machine, with fewer ports. It would be hard to match this for anywhere near this price. I've used other Amazon refurb products and been pleased at the value. Unless you're looking for the fastest gaming machine this will service any normal home or business user.",

En Marzo/Abril aproximadamente la pantalla empezo a temblar/parpadear después de un momento de estar viendo videos en YouTube o jugando algún juego somo Sims. Instale siempre los últimos drivers de video y chipset, así como también actualice la Bios. El problema se iba por unos días pero luego volvía. Contacte al servicio de Asus que me dio unos drivers extra pero no resolvieron el problema. Restaure la notebook a valores de fábrica y tampoco. Ahora, actualicé la version de Windwos 11 Home a Pro y cambiar la frencuencia a 60hz. Sigo probando pero por ahora parece ""solucionado"".

Around March/April the screen started flickering/flashing after a moment of watching YouTube videos or playing a game like Sims. Always install the latest video drivers and chipset, as well as update the Bios. The problem would go away for a few days but then it came back. I contacted the Asus support service who gave me some extra drivers but they didn't solve the problem. I restored the notebook to factory settings and it did not work. Now, I updated the version of Windows 11 Home to Pro and change the frequency to 60hz. I keep trying but for now, it seems ""solved"".",
"I was looking for what I consider a MINIMUM specification for a Windows 10 laptop used for travelers:
At least 1920 x 1080 resolution
At least 14 inches diagonal display (15.6 inches even better)
At least 12GB, preferably 16GB, RAM
At least 512GB SSD
A modern CPU with at least 8000 benchmark rating.
At most 3-3.5 lbs
Good Service and Reliability
Ergonomic Keyboard

This unit fits the bill almost perfectly, except:
The display is not bright enough for use in high illumination
There is only 12GB of RAM - unchangeable
The screen size means that it is difficult to read unless you have tip top vision.

If money were no object, I would opt for the LG Gram 16 inch of this year; it has as many pixels as a typical 17 inch monitor, yet weighs UNDER 3 pounds, and has good battery life.  Reviewers have criticized its mediocre brightness but the sheer screen ""real estate"" and the feather light weight are the most important factors for a mobile laptop that's easy on the eyes.  However, models begin at around $1000, and progress up to $2000 ish.

Another option is the highly rated Dell XPS with hit UHD display.  However, the screen is so small (13.3"") that a presbyopic would need magnifying glasses to make out the letters and digits!",
"So this computer is perfect for someone like me who uses it primarily for work and very little for play. It's my first with a solid state drive (SSD). Much quicker than my old Sony Vaio with the old outdated hard drive, which was a $1,200 flagship model approaching 10 years old. SSD uses less energy because it has no moving parts and is more suited for the bumpy life of a laptop. This also has wicked fast 3.2 USB ports. About 10x faster when using jump drives that are rated 3.0 or above. This means I an easily use an external drive without the lag if I need more memory in the future. I see some complained in the reviews about the screen quality. Keep in mind this is an anti-glare sceen. If you are not familiar with this type of screen expect something different. They do look different and are easier on the eyes when working for long periods of time. If you are use to bright crisp screens and eye strain, look elsewhere. This screen also has some privacy qualities because it's harder to see from the side. Another plus is there is are no preinstalled obnoxious programs. Does have a week long trial for windows 365. There is no fingerprint scan. Had some issues with the last one so I see fingerprint readers as one more thing to malfunction while trying access your computer. No touchscreen. Almost never used it on my Vaio. I use the voice commands more. One thing I would like to have seen is a USB C connection, the reason why I knocked it down a star. USB C is the future and Lenovo dropped the ball big time on this one. Has one port for a regular 2.0 USB, two 3.2 USBs (souch faster), HDMI, a card reader, and a headset/microphone jack. The internet connection via wifi is great. Bluetooth also works great as I use it for an external speaker. The speakers on the computer are a little disappointing. Okay for regular function, not great for music. With a 12 gig ram and a solid state drive there is no lag with data transfers and it starts up quickly. Haven't fully tested the battery, but it lasted 5 hours on my last use. This is a nice computer with up to date drive technology and no fluff that I wouldn't use anyway.",
"This was supposed to be a premium tablet. Yet, it is impossible to hold it, either in portrait or landscape, without accidentally touching the screen or the physical home/back/task buttons. If you hold it in portrait, the edges available for you to hold is so tiny that you touch the screen all the time. If you hold it in landscape, you will keep pressing the back button accidentally.

The multiple-window feature is marginally useful. But having it activated by a in-bound swipe from the right edge is simply crazy. There are so many apps who use the same gesture to turn pages. I have to disable this feature immediately.

And I expected a tablet with 1.9GHz quadcore cpu to be fast and smooth. On the contrary, it's not fast at all when I scroll between pages of my kindle ebooks. Much slower than my nexus 5 cell phone.

The only thing nice about it is the screen. But if you can't hold it properly,what is the use of it?",
"This was previously a 5-star review.  However, after 5 months of ownership, my opinions have changed.  The tablet  itself is still a great tablet.  I hated Touch Wiz, so I downloaded Google Now launcher, which is a big improvement. The battery life, however, is the achilles heel of this tablet.  If I use the tablet fairly regularly, I only get 3-4 hours out of the charge.  For example, today after playing a game for 30 minutes (Two Dots), the battery went from fully charged to 70%.  I was down to 7% by noon (3.5 hours of use).  Having had Nexus 7 2012 and 2013 versions, both of which had decent batteries, this is unacceptable.  As far as settings, the battery software says that the screen is using 50% of my juice.  However, I have it set on automatic, which keeps brightness to a minimum.

If I could go back, I would NOT purchase this tablet.  I would instead have waited for Nexus 9, or, Heaven forbid, purchased an Ipad Air2.",
"I feel like the screen resolution is too high for the CPU/GPU to drive. It's very laggy with screen animations. However, games seem to run fluidly so I can't complain about that too much.

What can I say, it's a tablet, it does tablety things, the screen is pretty. It slows down a lot with more than a handful of applications running so I frequently find myself closing all the apps. Battery life is pretty good. Wifi seems stable and consistent. I filled up the 16GB quickly. I'm not sure why they even offer 16GB anymore. Minimum should be 32GB in my opinion. I added a 64GB SD card but can't move enough apps over to free up much space. I'm sure I'll max out pretty soon with many more apps. I guess I'll just have to delete some stuff (it's not like I use every app all the time, but it would be nice to have all my apps all the time). Overall, it's not bad, I don't know that I would but it again. It needs polish as far as performance.",
"The super AMOLED display looks really bad. That is why I never got a Samsung phone. The saturation totally ruined the whole device. I cannot even stand to use my tablet. The Samsung Galaxy tab pro 8.4 display is the best.
I have both and to tell you the truth, $360 for the Tab S is not worth it. The technical difference is not worth the extra $160 in Comparison to the Tab pro $199 value. (FYI: this was my lucky sale price of the brand new devices. I got Tab S from amazon prime, Tab pro from best buy)
-The Tab S is just a marketing scam. The processor is a lot slower (this is coming from an actual user of both devices. I am not a product reviewer).
-It takes a tad longer to open an app, a lot longer to download apps and watch videos on tab S.
-You cannot even Enjoy the display of videos and pictures because of the AMOLED display. Everything looks fake. It is like using windows 1998.
-The WiFi connection is really bad. It seizes At random.
-copy and paste does not work properly. Sometimes you copy a text, but it pastes an empty text.
- it takes longer to charge the battery
-the battery life does not last long at all.

If you really want to enjoy the fullness of a good tablet, just buy samsung galaxy tab pro 8.4. You will not regret it. That is the best tablet so far. The resolution is superb. And everything works great in comparison to any tablet out there.",
"i have been using the tablet for the past 8 months, and it was excellent, except for the battery life. but overall it is a nice tablet, and easy to use (i am also an ipad/ iphone user). i am not using it for heavy usage, just for reading from kindle, school and office stuffs, and the internet. but now, the problem occurred when it is constantly keep on rebooting. i did the factory reset, did the master reset and also clearing the caches. i even do not backup any files, in fear that some of the files contains viruses. but, it keep on rebooting and  i cannot do anything with it.

i sent email to the customer support, and they suggested me to send it back to them or go to the nearest Best Buy, with a promise to replace/ repair it if the problem is from their end. hopefully they will honor the promise. now waiting for them to provide me reference ID, for me to send it to Best Buy.

will updates later on the specific problem and how the customer support deals with it",
"I know I'm just tooting the horn that Samsung wants... but... the display on this thing is out of this world amazing.  I've had it for almost a month, and I still like watching the 4K sample video that comes preloaded just because its so stinking pretty.

Other than the gorgeous display... this thing is a feather in size and weight.  It blows the iPad mini out of the water in how light and comfy it feels.  Much easier to hold in one hand as well.

It's lightning fast at anything I've tried to run with it, all the way up to 4K video.

And because its such an important feature to me... I have to state that I LOVE the microSD card slot... I added 64BG of memory to mine and have all the space I think I could want.

It took a little getting used to the ""Menu"" button being gone and being replaced with the ""recent apps"" button.  However, after a slight adjustment... I'm finding that in general I like it better.",
"I got a refurbished one back in 2014, had to return it because it kept shutting down and restarting the moment it arrived in the mail. I was really excited to own this item because I did my research at the time and I wanted a tablet that wasn't too small or too big, thin & can fit in my purse as well as a rectangle not a square. I wanted it to be the size of a page in a normal size textbook because I was still at University at the time. The 7in. was too small for my needs and the 10in+ was too big.

HOWEVER, I purchased a new one at Walmart in November 2014 nearing the thanksgiving sales so I got quite the discount on it. I have to say that product-wise, I love my tablet and it's going to be almost 2 years since I initially purchased mine. I highly enjoy mine and I can't bring myself to try the newer tablets by Samsung because I like this one so much. I will definitely be heartbroken when this one decides to break down on me!",
"I love my new tablet.  It's light weight, easy to use in bed for reading or watching Netflix.  This was a replacement for an old, dying Nook Color.  I knew I did not want to go with another Nook,but besides the Samsung Tab S,  I had also  considered the  newest Kindle Fire HDX 8.9.  What sold me on this Samsung tablet, was the fact that I could add a micro SD card  for additional storage, and that I could use apps from Google Play store.  Because I have a Galaxy4 phone, I was familiar with the operating system.  I had it up and running in no time.  I got a great deal on the Dazzling White one, $50 less than the Titanium colored one. The only big disappointment for me is the fact that I cannot view Amazon Prime Instant videos on this tablet.  It's not Samsung's fault, but Amazon's.  Funny because I can watch them on my Samsung phone... but apparently they are incompatible with this tablet.  Makes no sense to me.  All I can think is that Amazon is purposely doing it so that you have to buy a Fire Kindle.  :(",
"This is my 3rd Galaxy tab. My first was the original 7 in. Tab that I used with Verizon cellular service. My second was the 7 in. Tab 2. When my contract with Verizon expired I used the tab with WiFi only. I saw this Tab S in a store and was really impressed so I bought one on  Amazon.  It's pretty fast and responsive. Movies play very well on it. I like being able to  add an SD card  which  really  expands the storage. No need to keep pictures and music in the cloud. I have small hands so it's  a little awkward to hold but I knew that going in. I bought a matte screen protector which takes away from the clarity of the screen  but it's  resistant to fingerprints  and smudges which  drive me crazy. :)

The battery life is pretty good ..maybe 4-5 hours which  is ok. A larger battery would've been nice but would make the Tab too bulky. As it stands, this tab is very thin, all things considered. Very happy over all.
,",
"This is better than the newer models. I've had the newer models and they just didn't match up.
First of all, this tablet has haptic feedback, meaning that when you type on it the keyboard vibrates which is a must when you are typing a lot. I do not understand why Samsung pulled that from the newer tablets.
Secondly, the speaker placement is near perfect. There is a speaker on each side of the tablet when viewing it in landscape mode. The audio quality isn't the greatest but it is on par with the newer Samsung tablets where the placement of the speakers is at the bottom.
Viewing the display outdoors is a delight and gets nice and bright.
The tablet feels thinner and much lighter than even the 7"" newer models from Samsung.
Coupled with the official Samsung cover-view case, this is a great device.
It does lag at times but so do the newer models and my biggest complaint is that the battery life isn't the greatest; however, I can get 1 1/2 days of heavy use out of it.",
"Nice display, very bright, very high resolution, nice Octo CPU, snappy tablet!  However my application would not run on it adequately.  I'm not sure if it was the fault of the application itself or not.  However it wouldn't run the app smoothly so I sent it back.  It ran all the other apps on the system just fine.  Downloaded the latest Lollipop OS, but didn't work well with my Phantom3 drone app, Pilot.  I also wanted a Verizon cellular version, but it wasn't available because the tablet was too new, I think.  All of the Verizon stores didn't know anything about it, nor when a cellular version of the Tab S 8.4""would be released.  So I sent it back because of these two reasons.  I bought an Ipad Mini which runs the app fine.  That's another story, as the Ipad isn't very intuitive, and that's what it's suppose to be from all the hype you hear. I've been in computer technology for 35yrs, owned one of the first Macs sold in Calif (1984), but these iPads take some training and getting use to.  I hate the IOS keyboard versus Android, and I miss my Swype Android keyboard utility.  Swype for IOS stinks to high heaven.",
"This tablet is a solid computing unit, but it requires a case like an Otter Box or something to provide it with protection beyond the clip-on screen shield provided.

The response time is excellent, and the camera and microphone work well for Skype and other applications. Once you install an app for email, etc., it performs very well, and rarely has period of network drop or undue interference that impedes the overall function of network communications.

Of course, more memory, higher link speeds, and higher resolution are always better, but this tablet is a great buy for someone at a lower price point. The imagery displays great on a display that is better than one would think. The increased resolution of the tablet goes beyond some desktop video cards on a typical LCD screen and will not disappoint.

Throwing a fat microSD card inside will alleviate most storage bottlenecks when considering multimedia, but bloated size apps and unspecified storage locations may cause some headaches for non-power or not-tech savvy users.

This would also be a decent unit for a tween or high school student for school tasks and research. More intensive users may want a slightly more powerful tablet, but this computer will work well for a wide variety of users.",
"I've had a variety of tablets, running different operating systems, including the Nexus 7 and iPad. I've carried an Android phone for years and have always hated going back and forth to my iPad, so I purchased this to replace it. mainly to consume media on, as I love Spotify and PLEX.

Tablet Construction I Like

- Very slim design
- Feels well made
- Very little bezzle around the edge of the screen

Features I Like

- Screen looks amazing
- Micro SD card up to 128 GB. I've added a 64 GB one into mine that holds PLEX movies and all my downloaded Spotify music
- Finger print reader is also nice, however most company Exchange servers probably won't support it
- Ultra fast processor makes using the tablet very fast

Software Thing I Don't Like

- I'm not a fan of Samsung's Touch Wiz interface, so I replaced it with Nova Launcher which has a better Google feel to it
- After replacing the launcher, I discovered the Samsung no longer support lock screen widgets, this includes if you are listening to music, you have to unlock the tablet to change the song, no controls on the lock screen

Conclusion

This is a great tablet if you like to take media on the go with you, as you won't find many others with these kind of specs with a micro SD slot. My only complaint is Samsung's interface, which you can replace with a different launcher, but it still limits things like what you can do with the lock screen. Great tablet though!",
"It has been just under a year now that I've owned this product, and it has been crashing increasingly since I purchased it to the point that it hard crashes about every 5 minutes of use...most often while playing games. I am currently looking for warranty information because this device has become unusable which is appalling considering I spend $350 less than a year ago. I've tried everything I can think of to fix it, or at least make it usable, but nothing has worked. I have never been more frustrated with a piece of technology. There are a lot of positive reviews for this product, I was very confident that I would have the same experience...maybe I got a lemon, I don't know. Any time the battery dips below 60% (which is after about 10-30 minutes of use on a full battery depending how you use it) the screen starts to flash, and within 30 seconds the device crashes and restarts - losing any information you had up prior to the crash. This is sometimes delayed while using it when it is actively charging, but even then it crashes relatively often...not to mention sitting on the floor next to a wall outlet is not the ideal way to use the device. If I use this for a 30 minute session, I get about 15 minutes of actual use. The other 15 minutes is waiting for a crash to resolve and the device to restart, which occurs 10 or more times at minimum in a 30 minute period. I am extremely dissatisfied, and hope to get this issue resolved with either Amazon the manufacturer.  I will update with my progress so that others in my situation can get this resolved as well.

Update:
Since my device was under warranty (the original year long manufacturer warranty that came with the purchase), Samsung was able to repair my device free of charge and it seems to be working just fine now. They did not tell me what was wrong, or what they did to fix it so I cannot update you on that end. The only thing they told me was to make sure I was using a Samsung approved charging cable - which I have always only used the cable that came with the device. Unsure what was wrong, but appears to be fixed. If you're having some of the above issues, either do some symptom research online or hopefully you're still under warranty and don't have to pay for a fix. My experience with the online form found on Samsung's website was okay, it took a little while for them to return my inquiry initially but after that the service was adequate. I'll update this to a 3 star review now that I'm not having any issues with it.",
"ITERATION#2:
In my first review (ITERATION#1), I gave this tab a 1 star rating because it came with a cracked screen. Amazon received my complaints & instantly sent a replacement. Than you Amazon.

I'm so glad that I didn't change my mind about this tab because of the broken screen. I've used it for several days now and I will say I am highly impressed. I highly recommend it and I'm looking forward to a Note version of this tab.

The screen is very bright. The resolution is ""razor"" sharp and the colors are truly gorgeous. People complain about Samsung TouchWiz overlay, but I think this unit UI is highly function. On my unit, I removed some of the so called bloat software and left some on it. The MS Office program is the best I've seen on any tablet so far.

Perfect for reading ebooks.

The camera lags by several seconds before taking a shot. This is a minus, but I don't rely on my cameraphone for serious shots.

The high resolution at times makes characters appear in very tiny less than optimal viewing sizes for apps not designed to take advantage of the high resolution.

ITERATION#1:
I will update this review again, but for now this is my take on this tab.

The unit I ordered was received with a cracked glass. It will not power up to the home screen.
The low voice over instruction hums when you glide your finger over the home and back keys. The screen stays black.
However the screen never comes up. I don't know if this is because of the cracked screen or a manufacturer defect.
It will not power up with the power up button.

This tab is so slim and portable, it's just the right size for me. In fact as soon as I saw the picture on Amazon, I said this is the tab for me. I would have even buy the LTE/GSM version but it was not yet on sale here on Amazon. SO I had to settle for the WiFi version first. Unfortunately, the packaging material is very thin and in my opinion very flimsy. As a result of this any little bump and bending from handling and shipping can get the screen to get cracked easily. I am not saying this is the reason why my own unit got cracked. But with the type of packaging used, I was not surprised to see the crack.

The packaging is sub-standard and it lends one to ask the question, ""Why should Samsung make an apparently excellent product like this and then package it in a sub standard packaging? These people really need to do something about this quality issue.""

I have used several Galaxy phones and 2 galaxy tabs without any issues, but the type of packaging I saw with this tab is in my not so humble opinion completely unbecoming. If they continue like this, then I will have to start considering and recommending other androids.",
"I have grown to like this tablet even more after I have had it for a couple of weeks now. At first I wasn't too sure as I bought a tab 4 - 8 for my GF at the same time and it seems almost as good for a much cheaper price. But this one does have a nicer screen when it comes to pictures and movies which is a primary use for me. But because the tab 4 doesn't have as much resolution as the S it is actually easier to read text in such apps like gmail. But I still have good eyesight so again I could deal with this as pretty much a non issue for me. So I was happy until I saw the 10.5 version while shopping last weekend and really liked the larger screen even more. I thought about it and because my primary use is around the house and not traveling, I decided to exchange this model for the 10.5. I think this version will do better as a pc with a keyboard as well.So for me the larger unit is a better fit for my needs. But if I was traveling a lot I would stay with this version as it is much easier to carry around and is a good size if you want it all (traveling and home use).

Pros:  Great screen for movies and pictures. The colors are very rich and the included sample movie looks great- almost 3d at times. If this is what you want to use the tablet for you have picked the best screen you can get right now for the job. Samsung got this right and even Apple falls short in this area. It took me a bit to get used to the colorful screen but now that I have, it is hard to look a laptop screen and not think it has a problem with flat colors.

Lots of features for geeks- file sharing with your samsung tv and also your pc. Screen mirroring with the tv as well. This was important to me but it should be noted the tab 8 can do this as well, all except a physical hdmi connection. This unit has great connectivity, just take your time to figure it out as some of it takes time to get it setup correctly

Con: Only con is the price and I have mixed feelings about this. On one hand , Samsung does make a superior product,so they deserved to be paid for giving us what we want. But then they turn around and make the tab 4 series which are really good tablets at a much cheaper price (at least on Amazon). So if you want the best, the S is what you want. But if really good but not the best is good enough, look at those tablets. This is the first tablet I have owned and the pricy screen is worth it to me because it will be used as a multimedia machine.

Best advice: Don't make the same mistake I did. Decide if you want a tablet primarily for home or traveling so you can get the size right the first time. If you can, find these units in your local stores so can judge for yourself before you buy",
"First, about the tablet itself. I would give it 4-1/2 stars. This tablet replaced an Asus Infinity T700. This tablet was everything the Asus wasn't. There was no lag time, the screen was magnificent  and I wasn't constantly getting my internet interrupted. I have a Galaxy S5 Smart phone and the learning curve was nonexistent since it felt and behaved much like my phone. My biggest complaint was that the battery length seemed to be lacking but it was a small issue compared to how much I liked this tablet overall. But.......

0 stars for Samsung.
I purchased my Galaxy Tab from Amazon on June 21 and it arrived June 24. On July 20 I used it off and on all day with no problems. I set it down on the table, came back in 15 minutes, woke it up and the screen was completely wonky. Lines and squiggles and half black. The touch had also quit working. I called Samsung and told them the problem, they had me try a hard reset...so I humored them (I'd already done that) nothing doing. They said it was still under warranty and I should send it to them. They gave me a RFR and so I did. Two days after it arrived at the repair center I got a call from Samsung. ""Unfortunately your tablet isn't covered for the damage it received. There is an internal LCD crack and we will not repair it under warranty."" Me: ""Why?"" Them: ""Because it was not defective, the tablet was damaged. But for $159.00 we can repair it for you"". Me: Well I won't repeat what I said to them, but suffice it to say that their implication that I broke the tablet is BS. I did NOT break this tablet. From the moment I had it I had a screen protector and a case. I'm careful with my electronics. After a few more choice words I told her to send it back to me.

5 stars for Amazon
My only other recourse  was to return it to Amazon for refund or replacement. I've never returned anything substantial to Amazon so I wasn't sure how it would go. I chose a refund. In the meantime I'm waiting for Samsung to return my tablet. Looking at replacing the defective tablet I realized that I really liked this tablet but now the exact same tablet is $100.00 more on Amazon now than it was when I bought it at $297.00. So I cancelled my return thinking I could re-return it and select replacement instead of return. WRONG. Since I cancelled on 7/28/15 it is past the 30 day return period which was 7/24 and it wouldn't let me change it. So my return was cancelled and I had no other recourse. CRAP! Now what will I do, I'm not about to just give up on $300.00 worth of tablet. So I asked Google, found a phone number for Amazon customer support and called them up. I explained the situation, after some back and forth he said that they would normally tell me to return it to the manufacture but ""this time only"" not only would they accept my return but would send me a new tablet free of charge. All I had to do was return the old one. YIPPEE!!!!!

While I am very disenchanted with Samsung's customer service...I mean how do you break a perfectly working tablet by setting it on the table and walking away?  It seemed like all they wanted me to do was either get me to spend $159.00 to fix it or go away. I was very disappointed.

Amazon on the other hand went way beyond my expectations and I am very happy with their flexible return policy and their customer service. I've spent quite a bit of money with Amazon through the years and I'm happy to see that my faith in them has been justified. Thanks Amazon.

PS.  I received my replacement tablet shipped 2 day FedEx. It was ordered while I was still on the phone with customer service. Thanks again, Amazon. You are the best!",
"Overall, I like this tablet, but I have a few concerns. I have both android and apple products, and I'm not loyal to either.  I have an ipad 2, and I've been heavily researching tablets for the last month or two because I would like something smaller with a better quality screen. This tab s has a beautiful screen, expandable memory, split screen capabilities to run two apps at once, perfect screen size (portable but not too small like the 7"" tablets I looked at), and nice options to customize (something I miss on my ipad).  The fingerprint scanner works great. The gold bezel on the white model is really tacky. I was planning on getting the simple case from samsung, but now that I see how bad the gold looks in person, I'll be looking for a case that completely covers it. I've also had problems with lag and reloading in the email app. When I click on some emails, it will flash the picture twice, pause to reload, and pop me back to the top of the email when I've already scrolled down. It's extremely irritating and something I don't experience on my ipad or kindle hdx. I called samsung support to see if something might be wrong. The tech support person remotely accessed my tablet, had me remove my email accounts and re-add them, and also checked a few other things. Nothing helped. After doing all of this trouble shooting, she then told me it was my network. It's not. My other tablets are fine. Then she told me it was normal. Which is it-a problem or normal? And how should that happen on such a top of the line tablet? Then she later told me google is working on an update to android that should fix the problem. Story #3 as to what's wrong. I don't have the greatest faith in samsung tech support now. At any rate, I'm hoping it's just something defective with my unit, and I'm getting a replacement. I'll update my review if the replacement is better.

UPDATE 7/14/14
The replacement tablet is also having issues with the email app.  On top of the issues described above, it is also adding white lines through some of the e-mails (they don't appear on the ipad). So, I decided to have a Samsung rep from best buy look at it (they do free troubleshooting of minor problems there no matter where you bought your Samsung tablet). Shrinking the font size to the second smallest setting got rid of the white lines. They think the blinking/reloading/scrolling issues are with the email app and certain senders. They added the yahoo email app, and it doesn't have the issues when I view the messages there (the yahoo app is very, very fast-faster than the native email app). Long story short, I either have to deal with the issues to have a combined inbox in the email app or use two separate email apps (and the gmail app is very, very slow for me). I've downloaded a couple different email apps from the playstore to try to get a faster and smoother combined email inbox, but so far I haven't found one I love (if you have a suggestion, please tell me!). Personally, I didn't like the over saturated look of the adaptive display (makes skin tones, among other things, look very unnatural). So, I changed the display setting to basic, and I prefer that. I purchased an ipad mini with retina 32 gb for a bit cheaper than this tablet, but comparing them side by side, I think I'd rather deal with the issues of the Samsung tablet for the sake of the screen. The ipad looks really washed out next to the s tab. I also prefer the customization options with android. As a final note, in case it helps any of you who also have carpal tunnel, the email apps I've used on the s tab are easier on my arm (my carpal tunnel radiates to my elbow) because you can scroll from the bottom of the screen rather than having to lift your arm every time to touch the buttons at the top of the screen on the ipad. In the end, I'm keeping the s tab and returning the ipad mini.",
"It had to be a good tablet as someone stole the first one that was in route to me.

Had a Nexus 7 tablet but it was beginning to freeze regularly, making me have to turn it off/on. But no problems so far with the Samsung one.

Good screen size too.  I love being able to use a SD card to store things if wanted. I'm using a 64 gb one.

Update: Dec. 16, 2015....Everything is great about the tablet except the battery life.  I like to play games like Candy Crush and Words with Friends, and they just drag the battery life down quickly.  I have to charge the tablet twice a day if I play my games more than a 1/2 hour or so.

Also in November I discovered that the tablet wasn't charging correctly and the battery was losing it's charge faster and faster.  Samsung paid for me to return the tablet/charging cord and they were both replaced.  Fast turnaround time.  But I'm just not happy with how long the battery lasts.  I think that if you don't play games much it's fine, but otherwise beware.",
"I spent weeks researching to find the best tablet, and this was the unit I selected. I ended up reselling it a few weeks later. Here's why.

I bought this tablet for its display. It has the among the highest pixel densities of any tablet and possesses the AMOLED display technology, which should deliver the highest contrast of any display on the market. The display certainly does have stunning blacks. However, there's something strange about the display. It may be great for videos and gaming, but that is where the pleasure ends. The colors are a little *too* vibrant, and when you turn off the enhanced color feature, the display still appears somewhat glaring and the colors seem too blue or green or something.

The display has a reading mode, but it didn't make the display more pleasant to read. I primarily wanted this unit as an e-reader. If you are looking for an e-reader, stay far, far away from this device. While the stated viewing angle for the Galaxy Tab S is supposed to be amazing, it's not. Even the slightest tilt of the display will turn it slightly blue or slightly green. It's so sensitive to this that as you look directly at the display, the far top will be slightly hued one way, and the far bottom will be hued the other way. This is part of the reason reading this tablet is highly uncomfortable, as the colors shift as your eyes move to the bottom of a page. Further, the text area seems to have a strange haze around it that makes it difficult to concentrate on the text. Even the general text area appears to have some bizarre hazy beige box surrounding it. There is simply something harsh and offputting about this display that makes reading it an absolute displeasure.

Further, the touch-buttons at the bottom of the frame make the device nearly impossible to hold without accidentally bumping them with a finger or even with the palm of your hand as your skin folds over the edge. To use the device, you have to hold it very gingerly as if it were incredibly delicate. The slightest slip and you've exited your app or brought up the multitasking window or gone ""back"" in your app. Long-term holding of the device is tiresome.

You may think I'm overly sensitive, which I probably am, but I handed an iPad Mini (1st gen) and the Galaxy Tab S 8.4 to several friends and family members with the same pages of text. Everyone agreed that the iPad was a world better to read than the Galaxy Tab, even with its far inferior 1024x768 resolution and LCD panel.

Lastly, this thing has terrible battery management. I had the iPad Mini and this Galaxy Tab sitting on my nightstand. I used the iPad for reading and the Galaxy Tab sat unused. I had to recharge the Galaxy Tab twice in the span of time it took the iPad to reach 50%. Even with basic web activities, the battery drops at an alarming rate.

Also, watch out for plastic case cracks. Mine was developing cracks near the headphone jack. The frame also creaks subtly while you hold it and adjust your grip.

If you buy one, please keep the following things in mind:
* You cannot resell it on Amazon without a verified account, authorized by Samsung themselves to sell it.
* Demand for these devices is low on Craigslist. After a month of posting below market average, I had only one reply.
* Returning to the seller involves restocking fees and return shipment fees.
* You're probably going to lose 20-25% of your purchase price if you don't like the device, as I did when I finally sold it.

On the positive side, the device is LIGHTNING fast. I've never used a tablet this fast. It has reasonably good sound with stereo speakers, and is capable of running Android 6. Video is very vivid and crisp. It is VERY lightweight and I like the aspect ratio of the screen.",
"I was extremely skeptical regarding purchasing this tablet, but I did want a new one as my ASUS Transformer Prime met a bitter end when the charging port had broke.  I just did not have faith in many Android tablets and was going to spring for the cheaper Galaxy Tab 4 as I really wanted something to work as an e-reader (books and comics), and movies on the go. However, I had experience with Samsung Galaxy phones (S1 and S3) and was familiar with their eventual lag and generally slow response. I also really never enjoyed the TouchWiz interface.

I’m glad I was able to play with one and hear a review from someone I knew, because this tablet was a fantastic purchase. Bravo ,Samsung. I left your phones, but your tabs are king of the hill right now. The screen on this thing is beautiful, it feels deliberately luxurious and pleasant to hold, and TouchWiz? Revamped, improved and downright delightful. It has some bloatware that I could do without and their welcome console that you can find when you swipe left on the home screen but nothing that really takes you out of it. For my comics, this screen is absolutely outstanding. I was going to go for the 10 inch but this is honestly more than enough; holding it, whether I’m on the train or at home is comfortable, and with the right case you can prop it up and load up Netflix or any other streaming / video app in your house. Saved us a purchase for a TV in the kitchen/dining area!

Highly recommend it.",
"Deciding which tablet is right for you can be really tough!I searched but Samsung offered a much full tablet experience than any other tablet out there in the market.I chose this tablet mainly because of its functions and features.The tablet includes:a good quality camera with flash,IR blaster(which I use alot),a gorgeous Super AMOLED display,fingerprint scanner,sd card compatibility,and a nice looking overall build.I enjoy watching movies and videos on this tablet,it just makes you love watching it more and more.Its very snappy/fast and gets every single task done with zero lag,this tablet is great for productivity!The battery life is just phenomenal,I get almost a full day with having to charge from morning when I wake up until I go to sleep at night.Additionally,one more thing concerning the battery is the Ultra Power Saving Mode which saves you battery up to 2-3 extra days without charging!One amazing extra feature is the fingerprint scanner which adds extra security to your tablet and even bank accounts.The tablet is crazily thin and slim,and the dazzling white version of this tablet with the gold rim just makes this tablet look luxurious.One discomfort would be the placement of the soft touch buttons which I press almost everyday by accident.Samsung really does create the best tablet experience and I wished they could of made the Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 with the same useful features as its predecessor offered.I highly recommend it.
Pros:*Fast processor
*Fingerprint scanner
*Super AMOLED display
*sd card compatible
*Long-lasting battery
*IR blaster
*Nice camera
Cons:*touch button placements",
"The Galaxy Tab S is the best 8"" Android tablet on the market, bar none! 8 inches is the sweet spot for portability and usability when it comes to Android. I'm typically a root and ROM kind of guy when it comes to Samsung devices because I'm not a fan of software bloat nor TouchWiz. Android really doesn't need any ""fixing"" by Samsung nor anyone else, so a vanilla Android experience direct from Google as it was intended is much preferred. Not having a wireless carrier tied to this device really minimizes the software bloat to an acceptable level. Replacing the stock Samsung launcher with Nova really helped to improve the home screen and app drawer.

There are some Samsung apps that you can't uninstall but you can disable most of them. A free year of premium Evernote and a 2 year 50GB bump to my dropbox account are nice touches. I'm not a huge fan of Samsung's TouchWiz theme largely due to the color scheme and layout but overall the experience is fantastic. At the end of the day it's about the apps, right? Some of the included features are very compelling as well. The multi-window function is my favorite feature allowing 2 apps to run side by side. Smart Detect looks for your eyes and prevents the screen from dimming if you're actively reading. Samsung's S Finder is annoying and useless, Google Now/ Search is a much better option. The finger print reader is an interesting feature but is flawed in my experience. It does work intermittently but sometimes takes numerous swipes to unlock, too many unsuccessful and you have a timeout. Hopefully they'll keep working on this.

The hardware is best in class, with a quad core CPU and 3GB RAM, more than any other tab in this space. The display is vibrant and visually stunning, really incredible. Opening and switching between apps is effortless with a large battery providing hours of screen on time. I read reviews of some pretty outrageous battery life claims which I have yet to experience. I can, however, use the tablet fairly regularly throughout a given day on a single charge with no issue. SD card expansion further separates this tablet from the Nexus line.

I also highly recommend getting a Samsung Book Cover for this tablet to provide protection, a 3-position stand and added beauty. Not cheap but very much worth the investment. These products are well crafted and feel premium despite repeated rebukes of using too much plastic. It really doesn't feel cheap at all.  Samsung's continued use of a physical home button as well as reversed capacitive ""back"" and ""open apps"" buttons is disappointing and goes against the core Android design aesthetic. All other Android devices have abandoned physical buttons in favor of Google's 3 on screen buttons which is simple and works well. I bet Samsung changes this in future products unless the purpose is really only a desperate cling to maintain parity to the Apple model.

Pros:
-Best in class hardware, screen, battery
-Android!!!
-Premium construction and materials
-Free extras like Evernote premium and 50GB dropbox
-Light, thin, portable...8"" is perfect

Cons:
-Samsung TouchWiz
-Some software bloat
-Some features need to be made better like finger print reader
-Will be slower to adopt newer Android versions such as Lollipop/ 5.0",
"I have used a whole PILE of tablets. Huawei, Apple, Amazon, others by Samsung (including later models like the S2).

This is still the single best tablet yet made. It is ultra-thin, ultra-light, reasonably fast, eminently hand-holdable, perfect for reading e-books, with a bright, saturated screen, the right aspect ratio to show movies large (almost as large as on a full-size iPad) but without wasting space with horizontal or vertical letterboxing.

I prefer it to my 2018 iPad and my iPad Mini 3 by a large margin.

It's a crime that nobody else makes an 8.4"" tablet with this screen ratio, and a crime that Samsung left this format with the S2 and later models and went with the strange 4:3 aspect ratio that iPads use (and that doesn't match any modern media format, meaning tons of wasted space).

That said, there are drawbacks:

- Battery life is abysmal for a modern tablet
- It's a bit more flexible than a person might like—thin can equal creaky at times
- It's getting older and a bit slower

But... For the price—there's still not a tablet I'd rather have. And I'll be sad when these are all just plain too old to be useful any longer, as nobody else to my knowledge is making an 8.4"" tablet, nor a tablet this thin and light, nor a tablet with a screen this awesome.",
"I have been looking forward to this Tab S 8.4 since it was first announced that it was coming out and now that I've been using it for the last few days it is fantastic!  I am a huge fan of Samsung tablets.  I have the Galaxy 2, 3, tab pro and 4.  I must preface this review by saying that I'm an older, retired women.  I am not very tech savvy, but I have learned to use tablets by trial and error.  The Samsung tablets just keep getting better and better in my opinion.  The AMOLED screen is amazing!!  It is so clear and bright, the colors are very bright and vivid.  Reading text is wonderful.  The tablet itself is as light as a feather, I can hold it for long periods of time without any fatigue or cramping of my hand or arm.  It is very fast and smooth.  Set up took less than five minutes.  WiFi connected immediately and all my info synced in a matter of seconds.  I use it for email, Web surfing, games and watching movies and TV shows and it is fantastic.  The keyboard is very nice, very responsive and easy to use.  I can't say enough good things about it.  The battery is also very good.  I went through the apps and either Uninstalled or turned off the ones that I won't use and I turned on the battery saver.  There is also a battery super saver, but it turns the screen to black and white and I wasn't crazy about it so I'm using the regular saver.  I have been using the tablet for 2 days of heavy use and the battery is at 38%!  This is my new best friend....it is perfect!  With Prime it arrived in 2 days.  I would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for either a new tablet or a replacement!!",
"Lenovo Warranty

  I purchased a Legion 5i (17”) with GTX 1660 Ti 81Y80005 US for $1,209.46, so it wasn’t a cheap laptop by any means. Within 6 months the blue screen of death occurred the laptop would not start up. When I bought the laptop Lenovo’s PREMIER service support came with the machine. I contacted Lenovo’s PREMIER service support.
  The PREMIER service support agent told me I needed to pack up the laptop and send it to them for repairs. I asked for my money back since this happened so early in the life span of the laptop, I was denied. I asked for a new laptop, again I was denied. I was told there was nothing their PREMIER service could do and to send the laptop back to Lenovo. Anything but PREMIER service.
  I am a disabled Vet on a fixed income with my spouse who is also disabled. We use the laptop daily for medical appointments, ordering medicine, bills, ect. We lost all that information.
  I contacted Lenovo PREMIER service once again. This time I got someone on the phone who decided to help me make a restore usb image. I did this on a dell backup laptop that is 10 years old and still works, that laptop replaced a dell laptop that was out of warranty but dell replaced it. It took two days to get this laptop running. But a least I got someone who was willing to help. I guess willing is PREMIER service.
  I spent over 1,200 on a machine that crashed within 6mo. I again requested my money back or a new machine, both denied. I was denied help, until I persisted. I then asked PREMIER service for a warranty extension since I have lost confidence this laptop will last. I was sent an email asking why I needed an extension on my warranty, I explained basically what I have explained here. I was offered a 30-day Warranty extension. 30 days is a slap in the face Lenovo PRIEMIER service.
  I have bought office chairs, hue lights, tablet all from Lenovo. This is the first time I have has to use Lenovo’s warranty service. I will not purchase anything else from Lenovo because all is fine until you need support. Or in my case lack of it. Do not buy products from Lenovo. There isn’t any support if it goes bad. PREMIER service or lack of any service. Thank you Lenovo PREMIER service for the 30 day warranty extension After all my purchase’s and my $1,200 purchase that crashed within 6mo. STAY AWAY, STAY CLEAR of purchasing anything from LENOVO.",
"I got this computer as my old one had been dying and slowing down along with other issues, and I have to say I think it is great. I got it while it was on sale, so I think it was worth the price. It has lasted almost a year with the same performance; it runs demanding games very well and smoothly. There is 16GB of RAM which seems to be the standard nowadays, at least for casual gaming, and it has been enough for me so far. I have run many games on this and performance-wise, it is definitely worth the money. As I've seen with other reviews, it can get a bit noisy but, in my opinion, it's not that big of a deal. My only beef with this machine (which is just an annoyance for me) is the designed hole on the front. What happens is the suction of the graphics card pulls in lint and dust through the big hole and the lint gets stuck on the film type thing on the card. It doesn't affect anything, however because there isn't an easy way to access the front of the GPU without removing a few components inside, it provides a visual annoyance. [Image attached] Again, it's just a slight thing that isn't too bad, just for people like me who find it a little annoying. Solution: don't live in an old house with dust and lint. Haven't had a problem with either keyboard nor mouse, both work as expected.

Overall:
Performance for price - 5 stars, runs smoothly and lasts.
Keyboard/Mouse/RGB - 5 stars, haven't had a problem with either one. Keyboard and PC have customizable light modes. Haven't had a problem with either.
Noise - Decent, 4 stars, depends on what you're doing with it and how much noise affects you.
Tower Design - 4 stars, looks nice and clean, holds components tight, though inconvenient in regards to potential buildup of lint or dust on GPU film/sheet/cover thing.

Great PC, I recommend it if you are a casual or somewhat intense gamer. Probably not best for running mostly AAA games where hardware specs are required to be high, though it still runs most well. Would recommend adding extra RAM at some point, although I haven't yet. Enjoy it if you decide to get it!",

"Right out of the box, turn on the brand new laptop and it has one burn-in spot on the screen.  Because it was more than 30 days from my purchase when I first started the computer, it was past the sellers timeframe to allow me to return it for an exchange. Dealing with Asus customer service is terrible. I had to pay out of my own pocket to mail it back for service to fix the burn-in spot on the screen. When it arrived back to me- it still has the original burn-in spot and now a second one that is new. Customer service tells me I have to send it back again. Never will buy another Asus anything again !
UPDATE:
After the second time the factory attempted to fixed the burn-in spots on the screen, there is some improvement but they are still visible.
We were assured before we sent it for repairs, that the hard-drive would not be wiped.
It was returned to us with all of our loaded programs (Office, Photoshop, etc) completely wiped. Talk about a pain to reinstall everything. I am so frustrated! I hope that all of you reading this will move along to a competitor, find another seller and manufacturer. Stay away from this product!",
"The Tab 3 was delivered in a plastic wrap sealed box but the tablet itself did not have any of the usual plastic film of a new unit.  The accessory box was ajar and there was no documentation.  I guess when they said ""includes all original accessories"" it excludes any user manual or quick start instructions.  You can easily download the manual.  The battery was fully charged which is sort of odd, like someone had just checked it out before shipping.  It has Kit Kat 4.4.2 installed instead of the advertised Jelly Bean 4.2.  Everything else seem to check out like new.

This Tab 3 is about the same width, 2/3"" longer, thinner, and lighter than my well used old 7"" Tab 2.  It even fits in my old 7"" sleeve, barely.  The additional RAM, memory for apps, speed, and larger display makes it a significant improvement over the 7"".  It seems like Samsung have been degrading some features on their newer Tab 4 and Tab A so this 2013 model is comparable to the latest Tab, at a refurbished price.",
"**UPDATE:
6/26/15 Be sure to monitor your tablet within those first 3 months of purchase. The 3 month warranty from Samsung comes in handy. The one I had purchased had a defective battery and charging port the reason it didn't hold a charge. I'd still buy certified refurbished in a heartbeat. Just glad I had the warranty so my tablet got repaired free of charge.

Sometimes newer isn't always better. I decided to purchase a Tab 3 8 inch model instead of the newer Tab 4 due to the simple fact that the Tab 3 just had many more features included at a moderate price vs. the newer Tab 4 which Samsung conveniently took some of the features it offered on the Tab 3 standard and put them all on the more expensively priced Tab S 8.4 model. Many features not present on the newer Tab 4 model such as the ambient light sensor, the 5 MP auto-focus camera, the stereo speakers, or backlit menu buttons. I love this little tablet. It's the perfect size! Though I wish Samsung would consider making a 9 inch version.The tab 3 that I purchased was a certified refurbished and at the price I got it for considering it was previously used, I would have never known had the seller not mentioned it. Overall, great value. If you are considering a Samsung Tablet, look at the Tab 3 model first before committing to the purchase. The tab 4 has a faster Quad core processor vs. Tab 3's dual core processor, however, the faster processor does not make up for the fact that the newer model lacked imagination and character. A true upgrade should feel like an upgrade, not a downgrade.",
"I'm glad I got it, especially for the refurbished price.  After buying this one for my wife, I liked it enough to get another for myself (brown/gold one so we could tell them apart).

I love the 8"" size, and I feel that the added RAM (vs. 7"" model) makes a difference in performance.  I do wish Samsung had done a couple things differently: (a) I wish it was slightly wider, so the bezel around the screen was larger, which would allow it to be held more easily without putting your thumb on the screen. (b) I wish the back was textured (not glossy/slick) so it was easier to hold.  That might also have made ""a"" not as much of an issue.  I did just order a case for it, which may make both of these issues go away, and neither is enough to make me wish I didn't get it.  It's a very nice tablet.

Battery life exceeds my expectation, and I've never felt it was slow/lagging in any way.

The one thing I wish Samsung didn't do, however, is put the menu/home/return buttons outside of the screen.  It does allow more screen space to be used by apps, BUT it's not as intuitive when you use it in landscape mode, and if you flip it upside down, it's quite silly.  But that's Samsung -- they've always done this and continue to do it.

It also comes with quite a bit of Samsung bloatware installed.  Some you can uninstall, others you can ""hide"" (disable)....and some are okay apps.  Once I customized the screen / apps the way I prefer, they're not an issue, but it's just something I thought I'd mention.

The camera is okay -- nothing great, but not terrible.  Outside / bright light is better than indoors, but neither is anything to get excited about.  Video recording is limited to 720p.  I use my phone for my main camera anyway, so this doesn't bother me.

The sound through the speakers is quite good and can be turned up quite loud!  I was impressed.  The speaker placement (bottom, when in portrait mode) means you don't get the stereo effect when in landscape mode, which is kind of dumb, because that's how it would typically be oriented when watching movies on it.

I find it plenty bright, and generally have the brightness set to manual (not auto) and at maybe 20%.  I hate the automatic mode....just like I hate it on their S3 phone.  It has a delay in changing the brightness when it detects a change in ambient light, and it seems like then it just switches between ""too dim"" and ""brighter than necessary"".  Since the level is so easy to manually set (in pull-down tray), that's how I use it.

If you're planning on occasionally sharing it with your kids, like I do, you can set up multiple users and make the kids a ""restricted"" user where you can limit what apps they have access to.  Just beware that, for example, if you give them access to the video player or gallery to view photos, then they can view ANY video or photo on the device.  You restrict apps, not access to locations.  (Fine for me.)

(My only other comment has to do with Android 4.4, NOT this tablet in particular.  Google, for some ridiculous reason, made 4.4 such that apps cannot write to the external microSD card.  They can read, but not write.  Oddly, they can also create a folder, but then not be able to write into it.  System apps (i.e. the file manager app) that come with the device / are part of Android DO have full access to the external microSD card.  That means, for example, if I use my favorite photo editor, I have to save changes to the internal flash, then use the file manager to copy from the internal flash to the external card if I wanted it there.  Likewise for other things, such as the built in ""gallery"" can read/write pictures anywhere, but my favorite photo/gallery app can read/write to internal flash, but only read from the external microSD card.  DUMB.  But that's Android 4.4's fault, not the tablet's.)",
"I did not get my RCA under counter tablet from Amz, but I did buy this unit never the less. And what a great idea it is indeed. The base station installs under a cabinet via 4 bolts. This base unit has a built-in counter-top light with three brightness levels as an added plus. The RCA tablet fits into a tablet-holder built into the under-cabinet base station and the RCA tablet gets its power from the under-cabinet base station.  Also, the under-cabinet base station has buttons which control the tablet i.e. volume/on-off. The tablet can be removed from the base station and used independently. Any mini-USB charger will fit the RCA tablet for charging when not attached to the base station. Having this CA tablet & base station is also like having an under-cabinet TV or media player, plus access to videos and email. When not in use, the RCA tablet can be swing up into hiding. My only problems were with the android apps that only run in screen portrait mode. When the tablet is attached to the under-cabinet base station, any apps that force portrait mode will be displayed sideways on the tablet screen. Not good. And the RCA tablet comes with Android version 10 and version 10 will lose support come September 2022. So any apps updated beyond version 10 may not run in this table after Sept 2022. This is probably why the tablet and under-counter base staten combo has dropped 50% in price lately. But until apps stop working with this tablet, this is a good under-cabinet combo.",
"This unit was on the front porch when I got up this morning. (around 9 - it IS Saturday) I had it tested, configured, installed (and cleaned up after myself) before noon.

I purchased this device to replace a 10+ year old Phillips under cabinet TV/Radio/CD/DVD/iPod dock. For some reason, the under cabinet all-in-one device concept has fallen into disfavor. My preference would have been similarly featured unit, but, if you can find one, it's very old tech or $1100. Since the current items primary uses were TV and Radio, this unit replaced the old one acceptably.  (see caveats below)

Pros:
1. The unit was easy to install with the provided template, however I had to fold the template back a couple extra inches because at its default fold, the dock bumped the wall before aligning with the holes. (I had to drill twice, so I now have four extra holes in the bottom of my cabinet.)
2. The screen is clear and bright and large enough to be fit for purpose in the kitchen, (actually almost 2 inches larger than its predecessor).
3. The sound from the docking unit is clear and the volume can be increased sufficiently to hear above normal kitchen noise. (I wouldn't start the blender, but ....)
4. The fact that the remote also activates the tablet is a plus.
5. The three stage LED light is an unexpected bonus.

Cons:
1. The biggest disappointment is the tilt range. The screen drops from horizontal to vertical (i.e. 90 degrees) only. This makes the screen difficult to view from up close, if you are more than 5 feet tall. I alleviated, (not solved) that by installing the device with no spacers in the front and the tall ones in the back. It helped, but did not really solve the problem. (And it looks like it about to fall off the cabinet even though it is soundly attached.)
2. The tablet is proprietary. The ease with which it connects to the dock is due to the proprietary additions, namely the addition of a four pronged docking port. This may sound like a great idea, but eventually the tablet will wear out and need to be replaced. You will probably NOT be able to get one with the proprietary docking port, and therefore not be able to use the dock. In my humble opinion, the dock should have connected via BlueTooth thereby making it future proof.
3. The dock has no ports. A handful of USB charging ports would have been great.
4. The tablet's USB port is micro USB not USB-C. (Although it DOES have a standard USB socket.)
5. The dock's power supply  is poorly designed. I have a combination 110/USB power outlet where this device is plugged in. The body of the transformer blocks the built in USB ports on the outlet.

Caveats:
1. As noted this unit was purchased to replace an OTA TV/Radio/etc. combo. This unit has neither a TV nor radio tuner.  Fortunately, it is a basic Android tablet. To address the ""radio issue"", I installed an Android streaming radio app. It took several tries to find a free one that didn't accost you with adds.  I ended up with Audials. It is somewhat cumbersome to find your local stations (have to search by call sign not frequency), but once you find and set them as favorites, they appear on the home screen and you're off to the races.
2. The TV question is a bit more tricky. I have an Amazon FireTV Recast (PVR). It has four tuners and works with a FireTV Android app to stream both live broadcasts and recorded content. In our case, i simply installed the app and was able to get very smooth and clear, live and recorded content on the tablet. There is, however, an annoying problem with that app. The app ONLY displays in portrait mode, but the tablet is landscape. This means that you have to chose your tv station by viewing the screen sideways. We'll probably get used to it eventually. We generally only watch CBS anyway, so it will almost always be the first square in the screen.
3. Another approach is to purchase an OTA tuner for Android (about $30). I have one on order. I'll update this review with the results.

Overall, I would have probably been okay with a slightly higher cost on a device with built in tuners, but you have to take what you can get, and this meets (or could be cajoled into meeting) the minimum requirements I established. Since its predecessor was not long for this world I'm keeping this device.

Update: TV Tuner trial. - FAILED
Do not buy the MyGica Tuner. It cannot be installed because the driver is unavailable.",
"4/27/22 My version did not come with 10 it was at 9 and it wouldn't update. Also said last updated in 1969 haha but amazon is sending me hopefully the correct version. other than that slight issue it's a nice combo. Love how it swivels left to right depending on where I'm at in the kitchen/dining room. slight downside to it is that i have low top cabinets so the tablet docks to low and it can't be tilted up but it's my new best friend in the kitchen. Watch my shows while cooking/cleaning!!!
UPDATE 4/30/22: Amazon sent a replacement for the above issue (version on tablet was Android 9 not Android 10 like the product description and cant update) and once again the version is at Android 9 not 10. And version 9 doesn't even support updates or security patches. Google play store doesn't support some apps using version 9, if it was at the 10 version it would support more apps. This is an issue with me personally because 3 apps that are very important to have isn't supported anymore on version 9. But I guess that's what you get for this product to be only 99 bucks. I just don't like that the product description is incorrect and even with getting a replacement to receive the correctly described product the 2nd one was still the same as the first one.",
"I got this cheap on prime day....and all I need it to do is run home assistant. So it technically works for that purpose. There are some major drawbacks though.

There is NO option in BIOS to set default power state to ON in case of lengthy power outages.

The wifi chip isn't detected in home assistant (August 2023 build) however the Bluetooth is. The only way to resolve this is to compile your own Linux image which is more than I'm willing to get into to automate my Lights.

The main board is not removable....the fan is not replaceable...and the WiFi/BT is onboard, not in a M.2 slot.

The included storage is SATA.  RAM is onboard.

If you can live with these limitations it's not a terrible unit. But I would definitely look at this as a fairly disposable product due to extremely limited upgrade paths or serviceable parts. It's unfortunate because the bones aren't that bad especially compared to a Raspberry Pi 4 (which is roughly the same price at the moment) and this is much faster. If I could swap the WiFi card and pop a noctua fan in there it would be a much better machine.",
"There's a lot to like about this mini PC. First there's the extremely small size. But don't let that fool you, it's packed with many great features. My 17 year old desktop PC finally died and I needed to replace it. I was looking for two features in a new PC that are becoming almost impossible to find - a VGA port for old-school monitors and an RJ45 ethernet port. The Benss mini PC has both and they work perfectly. Of course, it also has two HDMI ports for newer style monitors so I can upgrade my monitor in the future if I want to. The Benss boots very quickly as you would expect with an SSD drive. It also has two USB 2.0 ports and two USB 3.0 ports for peripherals. I also liked the Windows 10 Pro loaded on the PC. I am not a fan of Windows 11, but it can easily be upgraded to Win 11 by anyone desiring that operating system.

As other reviewers have stated, the only negative is the fan - it is a bit loud, but I didn't find it a distraction. What was more annoying was the fact that the fan is constantly turning off and on as the workload on the PC changes. But I didn't find this to be a deal-breaker. With a PC this small, internal heat would be very destructive so it is reassuring to hear the fan doing what it needs to do.

I also liked the fact that this PC is just that - a PC without all the peripherals. That lets you choose the monitor, keyboard, and mouse that best suits your needs. Laptops are fine because they are so portable, and I have two, but I also like to custom design my main PC that sits on my desk. The Benss allows me to do that. All things considered, I would definitely recommend this PC, especially considering the very reasonable price.",
"If you are planning to buy it for 4k playback, then it's bad news for you. While technically this cpu does support 4k@60 resolution, this unit as a whole really struggles to keep up. You have about 10 minutes of 30fps playback (just enough to test it and think it works) and then fps drops to about 3-5.
The build quality is... Well, let's say you need a screwdriver to take it apart and a pair of pliers and a hammer to put it back together.
The power supply they provide is shady as hell and i wouldn't recommend any one in they own mind to use it.

So what can you do with it?
Emulation wise - you can play up to (but NOT INCLUDING) PSX. Some psx games work but most of them run at 10-30fps.
FHD video - perfect, but in 2020 i wouldn't call it their highest acheavment.
NAS - just don't! Save your time and buy something that at-least supports sdcard to run the OS from.

Raspberry PI can accomplish all of this much better and at a lower price. Depends of-course what arch you need for your project.",
"As is often the case on Amazon, there are many reviews at both 5 and 1 stars that defeat the purpose of the review system; to provide real and honest experiences for other customers to consider as they decide to make a purchase.

I hope this one is helpful and counters the 1 star review citing  'barely run windows 10 if at all/Ripoff'.  That is simply incorrect and uninformed.  Long story short I have a fine device for general computing at less than $200 with better / more  resources on-board than the average under $200 device commonly sold on Amazon.

The value that a machine like this has for anybody depends on what that person wants to do with it. It is certainly not a ripoff at the sale price of $127 (that was featured for a few weeks in February .)  The complaint about 'no memory' and  'no operating system' (as well 'no storage') is irrelevant as that is by design .. this is a barebones kit and is intended for a customer that can judge for themselves what they need in terms of processing and what they want to add in terms of memory, storage and operating system.  I added 8 GB of memory ($33) and a 240 GB SSD ($37).  A review of under $200 devices on Amazon will reveal that they feature less memory (usually 4GB) , much less storage (many 'too little' 32GB, others 'functioning' 64 GB or a rare, infrequent 128 GB) and all with less powerful processors (some very much less powerful) that would make for very sluggish performance.  x5-Z8350 and N3060 CPUs are frequently featured and are rated much, much lower than the J4105 processor found in this Brix. I did try a x5-Z8350 last year and had to return it.  Evaluations of CPUs are easily viewed at 'fair estimate comparision' userbenchmark.com.  One could get by with 4GB of memory, but 8 GB makes for a generally smoother experience and is not that much more expensive.  240 GB SSD is not much more than 120 and there is flexibility to go with or upgrade to more storage and or go with less expensive hard drives if that suits your needs (like storing and playing lots of local video'.)

It takes all of 10 minutes to add the memory and storage to this device and anybody could easily do it.  This mini PC works fine with both Windows 10 (free/unactivated) and Ubuntu (free.)  The only caveat that I am aware of with Free Windows 10 Unactivated is a watermark in the lower left of the screen.

I am not a gamer, but if you think that your requirements are high and that high performance is paramount and your main need, then it goes without saying that you understand that this device is probably not for you. On the other hand the claim that it will barely run windows 10 is probably not based on actual experience and does not reflect reality.  I can say from actual use that it runs Windows 10 and Ubuntu just fine.  The past few years I have direct experience with a few carefully selected 'lower end' devices / processors that were used for browsing, streaming, email, spreadsheets, documents and home theater (playing my local video files) and they were all able to run windows and perform the listed tasks just fine .. as did this device.  A quick search on the J4105 processor will bring you to a number of devices that use this CPU and although those devices do have negative reviews for a variety of reasons, none saying 'the cpu cannot run windows'.

I am not an employee of Gigabyte and have never purchased their products. In the past I have purchased Intel NUC kits and Kodlix (under $200 complete systems) and been very satisfied with value and function. In general my impression of Gigabyte is that they are considered a quality brand that will have more positive reviews than negative. I was intrigued by the $127 price ('can that be any good?') as I needed another home theater device so I ordered it (if, in the unlikely case it could not run Windows 10, I would have simply returned it.)  After a week of using this device I am quite satisfied with my purchase and will update this review if I hit any snags.",
"I have had several Dell computers over the years that have held up very well, and the laptops in particular have lasted and performed well above expectations. However, due to reasons, we had to move away from their desktops. So we moved elsewhere for our laptop and tablet needs as well. We have a Hewlett-Packard laptop similar to this one, and I was in the market for another, so I decided to try this Dell and see how it went.

This is a thin, sturdy computer that will run most daily functions for most users. Whether you're up late at night trolling a message board eating Doritos and drinking Mountain Dew, or up early drinking coffee filling out spreadsheets and doing... whatever it is people do on the stock market, this is the versatile laptop that can do those things. I didn't want to install my second Photoshop seat on it, but I tried a couple of other graphics apps on it, and they ran fine for doing things like adding text and other simple editing functions. I tried Sketchup and it ran well enough, but I really needed an external mouse.

I'm getting another business license for MS Office in the new year, so I haven't tried that. I put another office app on, and that one ran fine. Going online is like butter on my favorite browser. I'm not going to try to play Warhammer 40k on this, but I was able to download Steam and play some games with lower system requirements.

It's lightweight, and the power cord isn't bulky, so it's easy to pack it and go. I can fit this into some of my purses. I have a couple of older laptops that are meant to be transported someplace and then put down in one spot for a while, and this is not one of them. You can easily pick this up and carry it anywhere you want. I love the backlit keyboard. The light is dim in most areas where I use it, so even during the day, it's a huge help.

It looks very sleek and professional. You'll feel very comfortable carrying this into an office or school setting. Even someone like me who is always eating at their computer and can't keep greasy fingers off the keyboard and screen shouldn't have a lot of trouble keeping this looking and feeling new.

I love having a headphone jack so that I don't have to rely on battery powered junk that gets lost, I'm pleased to have the USB and HDMI ports, plus an SD card slot, and a security cable slot. I love the SSD 256GB hard drive; if you happen to drop it or it takes a hit, the hard drive won't necessarily fail right away. If you do artsy things with it, or you're just used to having one, the touch screen is a convenient pleasure and can be a bonus when doing those precision artsy things.

I'm not as crazy about the camera and microphone, but it's there if you like to video chat. That's not my thing, so I didn't test it. There's no room here for a DVD drive, but an external one is cheap enough to buy if you need one, and most of the time you won't need it on the go.

That said, it's Festivus, and I do have some grievances. I should probably add that grew up in a systems analyst's household, which is going to affect my opinions about software and hardware. If it were up to me, I would wipe the drives on every computer we own, install Linux and be done with this madness. Since I can't do that, and since you're probably going to be using this as-is, I'm going to tell you what I think of its flaws as I dealt with them.

Initial set up is a pain, mostly due to Windows, but also due to all the bloatware that I have to remove every single time I get a new computer. It takes a bit of time for some of the bloat products to uninstall, and you should plan on a couple of hours for the Windows set up and any updates. McAffee will tell you the sky is falling if you remove it, and it takes longer than the other apps because they're hoping that you'll give up.

In addition to agonizing Windows updates, Dell is constantly pestering me to do updates to its own software. I am not sure what some of this software does except badger me to do updates, aside from Smart Byte, which seems to have something to do with playing video. Over the lifetimes of many Dell computers, some of which lasted over 10 years, I never used Dell Support for anything, and all this help and contact stuff just sits on my hard drives taking up space. If any device drivers need updating, I do that myself.

Usually I like to pop something like this open and install more RAM first thing. The problem with this model is that the RAM is soldered in, making an upgrade impossible. 8GB is what you get and that's the way it is. I don't build these things, so I don't completely understand any technical reasons that might be behind why this was done, but I detest being locked into things like this as a customer.

The speakers are on the bottom, which is not a plus if you want to get full volume out of them. Again, I'm not an engineer and I don't build laptops, so I'm not sure why the speakers couldn't be placed somewhere on top. As someone with ongoing hearing issues, it's frustrating to have all this sound going in the opposite direction of where I need it.

The touchpad is difficult to control for some reason; much more difficult than my HP. The cursor keeps getting stuck in resize mode on the internet and in other apps, and it's hard to get it back into regular clicky mode. Maybe this is a matter of getting used to it, or personal preference. My husband said he also thinks the touchpad on this one is temperamental compared to the other one.

You can bend this backwards until it lays flat, but I'm not sure what the point of this is. Why not make it bend all the way back so that it becomes a tablet if you're going to do that? I can't see myself doing a lot of graphic design on this because the screen is so small. Maybe you could do the basics on this and then move to a desktop for the fine detail work. This is more for taking the files on the go and attaching to a larger screen or projector.

The bottom screws on, so you can't just pop the battery out. You've got to take it apart to do that.

The power adapter slips out of the power port way too easily when I'm not using it on a desk. It's a tighter fit than my other Dell laptops, but not tight enough, and it's going to get looser over time. This may be something I'm doing as a user, but when I use any Dell laptop on the couch, including this one, the power cord tends to wiggle its way out with my movements. I don't think this is roughness on my part since I don't have this problem on the HP.

In spite of my grievances, which some users might not find so annoying, I have to rate this laptop four stars. I would have no problem buying this for my mother, sister or any loved one after having used it myself. The reason is that this laptop comes out of the box loaded with everything you need to get going. You'll only need a couple of hours to set it up (even if it is a pain), and it will be easy for most people to do. Computers are not user-friendly, and I think Dell is trying their best to make them easy to use. If you share my grievances, then you probably know how to get rid of most of them, and you'll still have a great computer. I'm happy to have another Dell.",
"This is a review from a decidedly non-techie person. I'm fine with the day to day items such as surfing the web, social media, email, documents, etc. but I am clueless when it comes to understanding specs, setting up computers, getting things to print, etc. That said, this laptop was very easy to set up and start using - same day as delivery. And as I use it, I'm very happy with the speed, screen and sound quality. My husband - who is Super Techie, was almost impressed with this small but mighty laptop. I even heard a hint of envy in his voice as he said it would be a great travel computer. This Dell Inspiron laptop is replacing my Acer Chromebook which I've had for several years. I liked that computer because it was simple, easy to use and offered no unwanted extras. The Dell laptop is maybe not simple, but streamlined and easy to use. I also like the touch screen. I didn't think I'd use it much, but I'm finding that it's handy to have.",
"I am very impressed with this laptop.  My work laptop has a 4th gen i7 with an SSD so I think it is a good comparison for an upgrade.  I was so excited for the quad core i7!  This new processor is so much faster!  From the time you push the button to power it on, until you are logged in is less than 15 seconds!

The included 8GB of RAM (soldered) will be enough for most people, but if you decide later that you need more, it is expandable up to 16GB.

This combination with the SSD and the quad core i7 is a really nice setup.  It isn't going to be good for gamers, with the Intel UHD Graphics 620, but they already know that.

The screen is fantastic!  I was surprised at how great it looks.  It won't be a disappointment.  The speakers are nice as well

Things I feel one should be aware of--there is no Ethernet port, which can be an annoyance.  It doesn’t lay completely flat at 180 degrees, but it is close.

This is going to be a GREAT laptop for most people.  It is light, compact, thin, well made, and reasonably priced for what you get.  I highly recommend it!",
"We use our Dell Inspiron 13 7000 7370 Laptop for all of our day-to-day computer chores. It is great for checking email, watching videos, and for our daughter to do her online learning.  It has a wonderful screen, excellent battery life, and plenty of power.

Having said that - we don't use it for some more processor-intensive activities...like editing videos, photos, or hard core gaming (Roblox and Minecraft don't count as hardcore) . I am not saying that it couldn't do those things just that it isn't optmal.

Notes-

- A great blend of utility and value. it combines a great screen, long battery life, with a pretty good value. If this was a Mac this computer would be more than double the price.

- lightweight - which is pretty important if you are traveling with it in a backpack

- More than enough power for most students.

- We have never had a single quality issue..

Final verdict - We have used the  Dell Inspiron 13 7000 7370 Laptop for nearly 3 years without any issues!",
"My configuration is a desktop for my main work in the home office and then a laptop for meetings and travel (using OneDrive) - this is a great laptop for the latter.

It fits all the basics I need very well:
- It's lightweight but still has excellent build quality - feels solid and robust and should be able to take some bumps and bruises.
- The keyboard is a good size and comfortable for typing - backlit keys raised a little and nice response feel
- Trackpad works well
- Looks sharp
- It's plenty fast and well powered for business applications.
- Good collection of ports
- Touch screen is a nice addition although not critical since it can't really be used in tablet mode which is where touch adds the most value

Some drawbacks vs. other options (note, these are clear in the spec so they're not worthy of any stars off, but just fyi) -
- The screen can open 180 degrees (i.e., lie flat) but can't go 360 or be removed from the keyboard (like a surface) so it doesn't really work as a convertible tablet or work conveniently for pen input
- The hard drive is nice and fast as an SSD, but at 256 GB it's much smaller than my desktop machine, which means I can't take my entire OneDrive with me

Typical issues:
- There's some bloatware that needs to be removed
- Setup is simple with a Cortana guided wizard right when you open it.  It took about 10 mins of my time to run through it, but then another couple hours of Windows doing updates before it was ready to use, and more time for bloatware removal",
"This is the second Dell Inspiron 7000 that I have purchased in the last 18 months. Both were purchased from a retail, big box store. The first was  a 15” Inspiron 7000 – purchased in January, 2017. The second was this model (the 13” Inspiron 7000) – purchased in June, 2018. The first of the two (the 15”) had a problem charging the battery. I was forced to send it in to Dell TWICE! By the time three months had past, I had only used the laptop for a few, non-contiguous weeks. After the 2nd repair, the laptop has worked well. This past June, the family needed another laptop. I fully believed that the previous experience with Dell was a fluke and had no fear in buying another. Unfortunately, it was not a fluke. A couple of weeks into the new purchase, the screen went very dim and started to flicker. I called Dell and was told that I needed to send the computer in for a new screen. The computer was three weeks old!!! So, now, I’m reliving the same experience. I have owned many Dell computers in the past. Nonetheless, I would be very wary of buying the Inspiron 7000 series. If you do, save all the original packaging to make it easier when you send it off for repairs.",
"*** Disclaimer: I bought this in Best Buy, not Amazon

I've had this laptop for the past couple of months already, and it's been a pleasure to have.

Pros:
- The laptop itself is light, I hardly notice it weighing down my backpack.
- The screen is very responsive, especially if you use a stylus that allows you to use windows Ink.
- The folding screen is really nice when watching movies in bed, I usually put it in tent mode to keep it up right and not have the air vents blocked.
- Dual booting into a unix system is pretty easy.
- The brushed metal finished is very nice, fingermarks don't show up on the outer shell.
- The material itself is pretty durable.
- Lit up keyboard, almost looking like a macbook's.

Cons:
- Battery life is so-so. If you're doing very CPU-intensive stuff, expect it to last around 2-3 hours. 4-5 hours if normal.
- The 256GB SSD is good, but pretty small and doesn't seem like it's possible to upgrade... (I haven't opened it, so can't confirm.)
- The touchpad is VERY VERY sensitive and a bit off-centered. Countless times I've been typing something and suddenly the cursor jumps to the next line because the very edge of my thumb touched the touchpad. It's something to get used to...

Aside from the cons, I've been having a good time with this laptop and would recommend it if you're looking for something in a budget as something you're going to do some programming on.",
"I haven't had a Dell in a few years so I was curious to try this laptop out. Set up was a breeze, only a tiny booklet came with because everything is done online. I did need to create an MSN account which I thought I had but I guess it's too old! The screen size is pretty good for doing daily tasks. I blog on mine as well and live tweet TV shows and the speed is great. I don't use the touch screen much but when I tested it all seemed to work well and was smooth moving around. Cortina isn't my fave, and she pops up frequently (you can disable this but it takes awhile) and the other bother is that with this windows you don't have an icon for short cuts other than the ""e' file. So, no logo pics are on your startup screen. We did look up ways around this (or at least to get an icon up) but it looks rather tedious. I have no idea why they'd not have this feature. It makes your start screen look all the same. The keyboard is comfortable and it has quite a big mouse area. Lightweight and much easier to transport than my older HP.  I use it off power cord for a few hours (7 so far) and it's been fine. The battery charges up fast.  I do wish they'd have a small lip or grip for opening when shut. It can be awkward. Speakers are good, not the best quality.  It's all back lit which is nice, and gives it a lighter 'look"".",
"I've had this computer for over a year and can say that I've never had so many problems with a PC as I have with this one. Right from the beginning, too. This PC doesn't fold flat like a tablet, so you can't hold it and draw or write with the Dell pen. The marketing is misleading, as they make it look like it can fold flat.
Dell installs all kinds of software that clogs up the computer. You'll spend half your time trying to figure out why it's so slow or why it's crashing. I had to reinstall the operating system almost a month after I got the laptop. Dell screwed up the installation of a security feature called BitLocker that left me locked out of the computer.

Now after a year or so, the laptop will randomly blue screen and crash in the middle of typing. You get a stupid blue screen with an unhappy face that says ""sorry, your pc had a problem"" and there goes your work.

One of the biggest issues with this laptop is the power management. When it goes into ""sleep"" mode, like if you walk away from your computer for 10 or 15 minutes, it won't wake up. You have to do a hard reboot, and you lose anything that you were doing. This is a consistent problem that I have every day. Every single day. And since my laptop is now out of warranty, there is nothing I can do about it but deal with the issues until I get another laptop.",
"I love the convenience this petite little laptop offers.  It's quite a bit smaller than my 15"" HP laptop and Chromebooks, though it's not lightweight because of the metal casing.  It has a heft to it, especially for its size.  That said, it still only weighs about 4 pounds and it packs a lot of features into a small little package.  Here are some of our observations:

*  Out of the box, it required a couple of hours worth of updates.
*  It has Windows 10 on-board and we had no issues adding our Office 365 subscription to it.
*  It a face recognition option for security, but you can also assign a pass-code or password.
*  The display is very impressive.  The blacks are very black and colors are very vibrant.
*  The back-lit keyboard is wonderful for browsing in a dark room .
*  They keyboard is pleasant to use.
*  The touch screen is very responsive and accurate.
*  The screen lays nearly flat, but does not fold all the way around to enable it to be used as a tablet.
*  It works well with an active stylus for sketching and navigating.
*  We haven't noticed any issues with WIFI capability.
*  Streaming is a delight.  The picture, again, is bright and vibrant.  This is where I go when I want to stream something by myself.
*  I typically have numerous tabs and multiple programs active at any given time and it handles all the traffic very easily.
*  Uploads and downloading speeds are respectable.
*  You can use either tethered earphones or Bluetooth enabled gear.
*  It has two USB 3.0 ports, a USB Type-C port as well as an HDMI port and SD card slot.
*  It boots up fast thanks to the solid state drive.
*  It hold a decent charge, but when I'm streaming, I tend to keep it plugged in.
*  The battery is neither removable nor replaceable.
*  The charging port is proprietary.

This little Dell has become my ""go-to"" when I need to look up recipes in the kitchen.  It's also a convenient portable media player and I always have it on-hand when we're watching TV.  It's also perfect for streaming the shows that no one else wants to watch - especially in bed, when my spouse is asleep.",
"Despite the revolution of smartphones and tablets, still there is a need for traditional computing powers for many who work with extensive data and graphics. One of the most important elements of today’s computing is mobility – where you can just pick up your laptop and go without worrying about weight and size. Therefore laptops like this have become more popular and the companies like Asus, HP, Samsung, and Dell have taken notice.
This Inspiron 7000 series (this model is 7370) competes with Asus Zenbook 3 series and HP Spectre series. Choice is a good thing of course. Therefore ultimately it depends on your preference which laptop you should choose. I also own Zenbook 3 (i5, 124 GB, 8GB RAM) and so I can make a decent comparison.

PROS:
1. SCREEN. The screen is gorgeous. It is bright and because it is FHD (Full High Definition 1920 x 1080) it is a visual treat. I realized that once you go FHD it is very difficult to go back to regular HD, (I also own Dell Latitude E5430 14” 1366 x 768, while it is a very good notebook, the screen is not as good as 7370). Zenbook 3 is also FHD and they both are great for work and watching movies.
2. THIN & LIGHT. It is really thin (.61inches) and light (3.09 lbs). For a laptop, this is compact and light enough to take it anywhere. Zenbook 3 is also 13.3” screen, yet is bigger than Inspiron 7370 because it has bigger bezel around the screen (and little heavier too, 3.3 lbs). It fits into smaller laptop case with no problems.
3. STURDY. The notebook made from aluminum, while light, it is strong. Another thing I really like about Dell products is that they have great hinges. They are strong and they do not break easily (as Zenbook 3 series did – a common issue – due to design flaw). If you tilt your screen to your liking, it will not wobble – not the case with Zenbook 3.
4. PERFORMANCE. Armed with 8th Gen Core i5 and 8GB RAM, most of your programs and apps will run smoothly. I had open MS Office 2010 (Word, Excel), YouTube, Kindle reading app, and several browsers (Edge, Firefox, Opera) at the same time, and the programs ran just fine. However, as you know, this laptop cannot be used as a dedicated gaming console. I have no issues with performance for my daily tasks.
5. FACE RECOGNITION. It comes with Infrared Face Recognition (part of Windows 10 that utilizes the hardware), and it works fast and well. Although Finger Print sensor would have been nice, but Face recognition is actually cool. I have come to enjoy it.
6. TYPE-C PORT. This is option is great for connecting your phones, and other mediums (fast transferring data), however please note that this cannot be used as charging your laptop's battery (UPDATE - 1/15/18: It does recharge the battery when the laptop is OFF, but slowly. But when the laptop is ON, it does not recharge, but drains the battery slowly than the normal - depending on the usage. For example, I have noticed that if you watch YouTube, then battery is drained slowly, but when you work on the Word, the battery percentage has been steady).

CONS:
1. TOUCH PAD. Because of its smaller size, the necessary compromise is that Touch Pad is smaller than the competition (Zenbook 3 is actually quite nice). But if you use a mouse, then this is a moot point.
2. FAN NOISE. Occasionally, you will hear a fan noise. Not a lot, but you will notice it.
3. ONLY 2 USB 3.0 PORTS. This is due to inclusion of Type-C Port. So if you use many USB related devices, then you need to get a USB hub.
4. SPEAKERS ON THE BOTTOM. The speakers are located on the bottom of the laptop, I thought this was unusual. However, the sound is clear and loud enough.

Overall, I like this laptop, I am using it as a desktop, and love the screen and performance. So if you are in a market for a compact laptop with power, great screen, and sturdiness, then consider this one too along with the competition. You will not be disappointed. Recommended!",
"This laptop is supposed to be our travel pc, when we go out of town so it was very, very seldom used. Then I realized what if it breaks before the warranty expires? So I asked my daughter to boot it up once in a while or use it for browsing the internet. A few days later, the Dell suddenly wouldn't boot up. It did a self-diagnosis and returned all green checkmark results but it keeps getting stuck in the repair mode afterwards. After spending an hour troubleshooting with a tech support, he decided that I send it back to Dell for repair.

After a week we got it back. I turned it on and it did the WIndows 10 updates. The next day the problems started again. Again it wouldn't boot up. Their Tech Support again help me troubleshoot but there is really nothing you can do to try to bring a defective unit to life. The laptop is still with Dell as of this review. It's probably the SSD with faulty boot sector that's causing the problem but they should really do extensive testing before they send those units out especially after ""repair"". Will I buy a Dell again? NO. Will I recommend a Dell to a friend? Nope!",
"Aesthetically, it's fine.  Not pretty, not ugly.  I'm fairly certain it's the same as the equivalent hp, like exactly the same.  The edges can actually be sharp, which is weird, especially right where you tend to rest your hands most.

Keyboard I'm actually happy with.  Typing is what I do and this keyboard is well laid out, despite being a 13"".

Trackpad is trash, but they all are, so whatever.

So all that is good for a solid 3 star review for mediocre laptop.

Now I have to bring it down to two because of the failure to resume.  Upon doing some research, it seems to be a known issue, but I haven't been able to discover a fix.  So close the lid?  Maybe it'll resume, maybe it won't, and I'll have to hard boot.  Walk away for a few minutes while it's on battery?  Maybe it'll resume, who knows.  And sometimes it does resume, after one or two minutes.  And I'm talking a legit 60-120 seconds, which is absurd.  I can hard boot it in 20 seconds from start to finish, so having to sit and wait for it to resume is just crazy.  But then it just doesn't resume at all sometimes.  I shouldn't have to open my laptop, hit keys, and then go make a cup of coffee, and hope I come back and it's on.

Batter is wildly unpredictable.  Will go from 30% to 5% in a heartbeat, and it's otherwise meh at best.",
"I don't like this laptop and wouldn't recommend it unless you can deal with:
when it heats up, the fan will make a really annoying noise. I've had laptops that heat up and I would hear the fan cooling the laptop, but it's usually a really subtle, light sound. This fan makes a sound that is unbearable. I've had to stop what I was doing on the laptop ( when I was at a meeting )to turn the laptop off so that it can cool quicker. Even with the noise, the fan still won't cool the laptop effectively and efficiently. It takes really long for it to cool unless you turn off the laptop. The fan is basically useless.

Also the speakers are at the bottom of the laptop. I need to invest in good speakers if I'm going to watch a lot of videos or tv. The sounds quality is not the best either. At sound level/volume 100, it makes this weird echo noise. It actually hurts my ears sometimes when it's at the highest volume, but I don't really have a choice, because otherwise I would have trouble hearing at any lower volume.

Besides the two main cons above, overall this is a decent laptop. It's relatively light and it can convert to a tablet (rarely use it in tablet mode because this would be a heavy tablet). I was never a touchscreen person, but after this laptop I actually fell in love touchscreen monitors. The computer starts up really fast. The face recognition is efficient too.

At this price, I would recommend just saving a bit more and get a nicer laptop. It's definitely worth the investment. This was in the upper middle price range, and it's more difficult for me now to get rid of this laptop and get another more expensive laptop. At upper middle price range, you might as well go to the A laptops.",
"Ironically, it took a pandemic (Covid-19) for me to finally bite the bullet and invest in a better laptop. My laptop was getting slow and having difficulties maintaining a charge. So, I ordered the Dell Inspiron laptop computer to dedicate solely to my teleworking (i.e., job).  Understand that this review is strictly from this perspective. I wanted something reliable and easy to use. I wanted something that allows me to connect remotely to my work computer and where I can surf. This does the trick. It is:

Easy to setup.
Comes preloaded with various programs.
Charges quickly.
A convenient size. Not too big or too small.
Touch screen. The screen is super clear and bright.
It has face recognition which offers extra security.
Has a long (charging) cord.
Can install additional programs easily. *I was able to add the programs needed to connect virtually to my work computer.
It is lightweight and fits easily in a large purse or laptop bag.
It has additional ports (i.e., C-port, USB, headphone, etc.).
It comes with a microphone and speakers.
I know some have complained but my fan is quiet/silent.

In conclusion, for the price and what I needed it for (I’m NOT a tech person), this laptop is perfect. I’d recommend it.  4 stars",
"I wanted a lightweight, small size laptop that I can use for web developer work. I upgraded from a i5 dell with a traditional hard drive that just crawled when doing development on Microsoft's .NET platform. This thing is perfect! The SSD and i7 combo FLY! I have never used a computer that is so fast and smooth with Windows 10. The most annoying parts are just normal Windows issues. A million updates to apply when you first turn it on. Turn it on in the morning and give it all day to do it's thing the first time through. I would have liked the page up and page down buttons in the normal spot, but I get it, they wanted to keep this thing small. Its just a little bigger and thicker than an iPad 2, but its a real, full blown machine. I have tested .NET and MEAN stack development and both are lightning fast. The touch screen is nice too and the facial recognition is not so great honestly, feels gimmicky. This is NOT a good computer to store your entire music collection or a bunch of movies on. The hard drive is plenty large for a developer or for just doing art work or browsing the web. Although speed-wise you could run Cubase or another power DAWs on this, it really isn't ideal due to the hard drive space. For me, though, its perfect!",
"The Transformer Book feels like the evolution of a netbook, yes those 11 inch laptops that were a thing back 5 years ago.  The ASUS Book Flip comes clean with no bloatware.

The Pros:
1) Small form factor with 11.6 inch screen
2) 2 USB ports (2.0 and 3.0), and USB type-C.
3) Touch screen
4) 360 degree keyboard, meaning you can turn all the way around
5) Bluetooth and wifi
6) 33W power, mean you can use webcams, usb hubs, things that need juice without hurting the laptop's battery

The Cons:
1) Display is only 768p
2) Glossy display, which makes it hard to see in bright settings
3) 32GB space.  After Windows 10, updates, some files (not software), you're basically almost have no space left.
4) Fingerprint magnet all over except bottom.

So so:
1) The Intel Celeron N3050 has turbo upto 2.16ghz, but not sure if this helps much.  Feels adequate.
2) 2GB ram may be just enough to do web browsing and youtube.  But any multitasking will feel laggy.
3) Mouse pad can feel finicky and clumsy.

The ASUS Transformer Flip is a decent computer for basic usage.  Don't expect it to do anything intensive or graphic.  Its basically for editing documents, watching videos, and doing web browsing.  But for $200 you get what you pay for.",
"i tried to love this tablet, i really did. i tried to give it a chance even though i knew it was cheaply priced and probably wouldn't meet my expectations. well at first it was really great as most electronics are, started up and ran quickly and smoothly. i read through the reviews before i bought it and people were complaining about immediately having to update the os and didn't have enough storage space, so i thought i was pretty clever when i bought a larger micro sd card (128gb). unfortunately it seems that the card space was only good for one update. there have been about two more major updates since the first one and i haven't been able to get my os up to current. it runs super slow now, and don't even think of trying to run multiple programs at once! if you're looking for a reliable laptop to do real work on, spend the extra money and buy a real laptop! this is only good for very small and simple tasks handled one at a time.",
"Just started using the Tp200sa-uhbf Signature edition 2 in 1 and so far everything seems to be working fine.  I wasn't expecting an amazing system, just something that I could use to type documents and surf the web and this is fully capable of handling those two tasks.  I was a little worried about the space on the system but after installing Windows updates there is still 17.5 GB remaining on the hard drive.  Not enough to install any major programs, but enough to store a few documents.  I got a micro SD card for extra space in case I need it in the future.  My product did not come with Office 365.  The seller (Glorious Days) offered me a $20 refund, but wouldn't supply the code.  I'm not sure if this was just an accident or if the computer no longer comes with Office, but be wary of this if Office is a selling point for you.

My biggest complaint with this tablet so far is the wifi reception.  There are places that I can get a decent wifi signal on my phone, my old laptop, and even a Nook but not with this tablet.  Be warned that if your planning to use this tablet in an area where other products only get a few bars then you might only get an intermittent signal or none at all.",
"This budget netbook has a decent screen, a decent keyboard, and is tolerable on speed and storage for the minimalist who uses it for browsing, writing and small tasks.  I bought it for the battery life, screen clarity and keyboard, because I use it mostly for writing and online browsing.

The first one I received had a defective left external speaker, but Amazon returned it without cost to me (except the time to clear the netbook storage and drop off at UPS).  The second one I ordered worked.

Windows 10 will eat up a lot of storage if you don't bridle it.  I turned off updates after the initial update at first login.  I eliminated the Office install (and did my own), the extra Metro apps, and used Powershell (administrator -- stop-service wuauserv type commands) to eliminate bulk.  I'm left with about 14.5GB of internal storage before adding my own apps/programs.  This is not much.  You can install programs to the microSD card (it takes a 128GB no problem), but it is much slower to load.

The speakers are acceptable, but for me not an issue.  Use headphones or a Bluetooth set of speakers if you want quality.

For the money, this is a good investment if you have a specific reason to get a minimalist netbook with the battery and screen it brings.",
"I love this computer so far!  I bought it for going to class and taking to the library.  I have a larger computer, but it was getting heavy lugging it around campus.
Pros:
It is super lightweight and has a small footprint.  Since it is smaller, it fits easily in my backpack and even in some of my purses and in my tote purse.  I also just traveled and it was great for on the plane.  The battery lasts all day, which is perfect if you are running around a lot and not always near an outlet.  Since it is so small, it does not take up much space on my desks, tables in the library, and is great when you have class in a lecture hall with the super small fold up ""desks"".  It is also easy to hold in my lap.

Cons:
There are very few.  Sometimes, it can get bogged down because it doesn't have a lot of RAM.  There is not much on board memory, but I use Google Drive for my files, so that is not a big deal.  I also just keep a micro SD inserted for if I need to save anything on there. What really annoyed me at first was since it has such a less popular charging cord, it took me a while to find one that I was confident would work.

Overall, I love this computer.  I use it in all the various modes because it can be easier when I am on the plane, in the car, or in class.  It is perfect if you want something light weight and portable, mostly for internet or streaming videos.",
"Note - I just received my computer today, so I plan to come back and edit this review once I have used it more!

Beautiful packaging and easy to open. The laptop looks sleek and modern, with a solid, quality heft that belies the ultra-thin profile. The charging cable/plug is nice and compact, but a little disappointing to me - the 2""x2""x1"" plug with only two prongs will easily slip out of my older outlets at the slightest bump. Not to worry, though - so far the battery life is amazing! Right now it's at 68% after using it on and off a lot of the day, and it still says I have 8+ hours left (assuming if I continue my ""light browsing"" use).

Windows 10 is already installed, and took of precisely 11GB of the 28ish actually available. I will be trying out some additional programs and using it more once I receive the 128GB MicroSD card I ordered to supplement the eMMC drive, but for now, I just deleted a few apps I know I won't use (since this is the Signature Edition there isn't much bloatware) and installed my preferred browser, Google Chrome. One issue I discovered with Chrome is that the touchscreen won't work while the keyboard/touchpad are enabled (aka when you're using it as a normal laptop). Apparently this is happening on most Windows 10 laptops with touchscreens and Chrome. After a quick search for help, I went to Chrome Flags, scrolled down to the Enable Touch Events, and changed it from Automatic to Enable. Works perfectly now.

My particular Flip came with a free year of Office 365 Personal, which wasn't mentioned in this listing but was in others, so it was nice to see it included.

Other than fixing the problem with Chrome and touchscreen, I've only had one major issue with using the Flip, and that's with the transition from laptop mode to tablet mode. I'm not talking about the physical movement of the hinge - that flows as smooth as butter - but the computer switching to a more tablet-friendly version of Windows when in tablet (or tent or display) mode. If you're only going to use one or the other this entire session, it's okay. But woe to the person who decides to switch from one to the other mid-task! Whatever window you were using in desktop mode disappears in tablet mode - instead you get the hated Windows 8-like app drawer and now have to hunt for your program again (and good luck counting on it taking you back to where you were). Watching a video in full screen and then changing to tablet mode left the video playing, but slightly offset from the rest of the screen (perhaps due to the notification popping up about the switch?). When I left full screen to see if hitting full screen again would recalibrate the size, I was greeted by the menu and no way back to my video, which blithely continued to play in the background. Reopening Chrome did not work, just opened a new window with no way back to my previous window. I went back to desktop - the window was still missing. Finally put the laptop to sleep, woke it up, and the audio of my video resumed playing, still with no window in sight. At last I started the task manager, which somehow triggered the Chrome window with the video to show up in my taskbar again.

With the ease of switching from laptop to tablet physically, I know I will be doing so mid-task quite often. My solution was to remain in desktop mode even when using the device as a tablet. I will see how this works going forward. I did make sure to leave the virtual keyboard button in the taskbar, so I can summon it when using as a tablet (though I found clicking several times in a text entry field will usually do the same trick).

The 1366x768 resolution isn't the clearest, but for a screen this small it works well (larger would generate smaller icons and text, and since they're fairly small already, a lot of workaround zoom/enlarge functions would be needed for ease of use). I haven't encountered any lag so far. The touchpad will take some getting used to (scroll is more sensitive, tapping less sensitive than my other laptop). The exterior top is a fingerprint magnet, which does take away some of the beauty of the brushed metal design. The interior isn't as bad, though they definitely show on the touchpad. Keys are small, but nice to type on, with a solid thunk as you press them. As one of my main reasons for selling my tablet and getting this was the ability to do more writing on a more portable device, I think it will work well.

Due to the limited storage, I don't know that this will completely replace my laptop, but I fully expect to use the Flip at least 75% of the time, and could definitely see using it for a month or more on its own if I was between other computers. However I don't use much software beyond Chrome and Office (though I want to use Scrivener and GIMP more, as well as several browser-based applications, and I will test their performance on here), so I don't need a workhorse.

I don't intend to use this for games, which is why I didn't choose an Android tablet. I will use the keyboard to type or as a stand most of the time, so I didn't choose something with a detachable keyboard. I wanted something that would run cool and boot fast, so I didn't chose a laptop with a conventional hard drive. I could have used something with more space, but with the way technology advances, I figured I would be replacing whatever I bought in a couple of years anyway - why not see if 32GB works since the price is right while I have another working laptop? I wanted a device for writing, browsing, going seamlessly between the two as I research, creating blog posts, editing spreadsheets, and watching TV shows. I think the Asus Transformer Flip will work perfectly for my needs.",
"This is a great little laptop with tablet capabilities, all with Windows 10. I received a free year of Office 365 with this purchase, as was advertised. As with most 2-in-1s, the keyboard flips around to the back, which turns on the tablet mode. The keyboard keys and touchpad are automatically disabled, so there's no fear of pressing buttons while holding the device in tablet mode.

At this price point, the device works great.The processor is a bit lackluster, so multitasking like you might do on a full laptop might slow you down. But light tasks such as single tab web surfing or using an Office product work fantastically. Don't try to compare this laptop/tablet to a Microsoft Surface or an iPad, as it won't hold up. However, for the price point, this is a great supplemental device that I can easily take with me to work or classes without lugging around my 17"" laptop.

Pros:

Price!
ASUS always has great quality built products. Light weight, but not flimsy.
Keyboard has very satisfying presses, again it doesn't feel flimsy.
Charge life exceeds my expectations. Light to medium use will last a couple of days before needing to charge.
Switches to tablet mode seamlessly.
Supports micro SD card up to 128 GB.

Cons:

Though touch supports multi-gesture, it is overall not as responsive as much more expensive devices.
Screen and touchpad are fingerprint magnets, even after only a few hours of ownership.
Not great at multitasking.
Tiny on board storage of only 32 GB, which includes the OS install. Definitely take advantage of the SD card slot.

*Note: This laptop didn't include the Windows 10 Anniversary Update. If you try to use the update tool from the website, it will fail siting that you don't have enough space, even if you have an SD card installed. THERE IS A WORKAROUND! Download the Windows 10 Media Creation Tool. Run the tool and select ""Upgrade This PC"". It will work, but it might take a few hours. It will still save any documents you may have already saved.",
"I really wanted to like this laptop/tablet, but the fact that I have put it away speaks volumes.  I thought the battery life was fine and I did not have the issues with the charger that some other reviewers had.  You are not going to do anything intensive with this system.  I used it when I was on the go and needed something larger than my phone for general browsing, sending an email or document processing.  The wi-fi and bluetooth worked well as I never had an issue connecting to any internet source or pairing it with my phone in a hotspot situation.

The main issue is the hard drive.  The specs state that it is a 32GB drive, but the usable space is less than 10 after the operating system.  Windows 10 is going to drive you crazy with updates, even if you try to turn off the ""Auto"" function.
 There just isn't enough space to install them.  And it makes using the laptop infuriating.  If you try to install any piece of software, you are done.  You cannot install Office or any of its components.  You can try using an online version of Word or Excel, but you don't have any storage capacity.  You can forget pictures and video.  I ended up using a WD Passport as an external drive connected via a short USB cable for local storage and Dropbox for online storage.

The price is great, but I just recently went shopping for laptops and tablets and found several that are in the $300-500 range that have larger hard drives, more memory and are upgrade-able if you choose to buy a different component.  In the end, I wouldn't buy it again and I hate that I have lost $250.",
"I've owned tons of computers and I was looking for something with a slightly bigger screen that I could use when I travel.  I had previously used an Acer switch 10 that I bought refurbished on Ebay.  This unit shipped with WIndows 8 and after setting up the computer it soon prompted me to update to Windows 10.  I did the update, but soon noticed that it was extremely slow.  I found that after the update it used almost the entire C:\ drive.  It wasn't until I removed the old win8 files that it had about 10gb of space remaining.

As a daily user when I travel, this computer is SLOW.  It was supposed to have a better processor than the acer (atom Z3735F vs celeron N3050), but it is definitely much slower in daily tasks.  Opening more than 3-4 windows in Chrome brings it to a standstill.  This computer is going in the trash pile of computers I have around my house.  My older acer is much faster and I will go back to it for another 6 months.",
"UPDATE 2: It's been nearly 9 months. This will most likely be my last review.
UPDATE: It's been nearly 4 months, so I added an update at the bottom of this review.
=====
There are a number of good reviews on this gem of a device, so I won't recount some of the broadly agreed upon features in detail. I will touch on some tweaks and gems that might make it a little more usable for you.

Summary (remember, this is value/effectiveness compared to price and device class):
++ Excellent battery life - consistenly pushes 8 hours on one charge
++ Very good audio
+ Good display/video (remember that this is based on devices of this class/price)
+ Good input (keyboard is comfortable size for these ham-hands with pleasant tactile response; touch pad functions well)
+ Good speed (remember that this is based on devices of this class/price)
+ Plays Well with Other Devices (Bluetooth and HDMI connection works flawlessly from what I can see; connecting to other systems via internet connection has been spotty for me though it may be my TV but - haven't experimented enough to be sure)
+ Runs programs pretty well (have only tried a couple of light/older games which were not terribly intensive, and did not do a lot of play-testing other than to verify that they loaded and ran). Most importantly, I was able to import (install) MS Office 2010 which runs flawlessly as long as you have a legit license - hey, it's a great version of Office.
- Highly proprietary charging adapter: lucky the power time is so long because you probably don't have to move it (which is when we typically lose or damage our chargers)

In short, everything that you'd like to see in a budget laptop with the added bonus of transforming to a tablet. The ""transforming"" features work rather well with keyboard/touchpad deactivated past 180 degrees (making it an interestingly useful device to use on your lap up against your steering wheel while in a car waiting or resting, a touch tablet with its own stand, or fully folded as a tablet) and option to enter tablet mode (instead of being forced into it, though you can set a default). As pointed out before, it can be awkward when attempting to use as a tablet - most 10+ inch devices can (my personal fave is the 8"" or a little larger than a paper back book).

Here are some things I noticed that may be useful to know, some common to Windows 10, maybe others common just to this tablet:

+ The power level of a Win 10 device with a 2GB RAM processor running sub 2GHz speeds is optimal for browsing, light gaming and the like. If you're a serious gamer who can afford to play all those great games, you're not running it off a tablet in any case. But if you're generating correspondence, checking emails and calendars, making spreadsheets and presentations, and playing Mah-Jong , then this is THE gadget for you.
+ The actual physical buttons for power and volume were so responsive that I didn't realize I had pressed it when trying to turn it on. It takes very little pressure to use them and the lack of tactile feedback can be disconcerting.
+ HDMI output works flawlessly - true plug and play. No glitches using the Project feature (duplicate screen, monitor only, computer only, extend for dual screen).
+ Google Chrome worked with no problems. I note that here because I've purchased a Win 10 tablet that required a bit of effort to make it work.
- Forget using your External DVD reader to load programs from disk: that's a chore... I'm not sure if it was my external DVD drive or just something in the whole schema of things, but it was way too slow. I got a drive clone program and mount a virtual disk - which worked exceptionally well for me.
- If you plan on using Google Drive, make sure you have a microSD card (formatted to NTFS file format) of 32+ GB, create an appropriate folder on that drive and carefully go through Drive's set up routine and choose that folder as your Drive files storage. If you try to save your files to a microSD card formatted on anything other than NTFS, Google Drive will politely reject you (without explaining why).

9/30/16 UPDATE
4 months later and I will soon get another of the same model to replace this thing, but let me explain why:
+++ Physical Durability: THIS LAP-TAB IS TOUGH!!! I have dropped it more than my cell phone, I've literally tossed it 8 feet across a room (accidentally - it was sitting on a nearby surface during an Italian Table Flip Incident) and it finally took significant damage while I was on a train where it was accidentally knocked over and the screen developed numerous fractures... and STILL works. I did have to figure out how to disable the touch feature as the fracture pressures were causing multiple ""finger presses"" but it's been 4 weeks and this thing still works GREAT! I'm trying to be a little more cautious with it, so I did by a generic 11.6"" screen protector to keep the damage from spreading, and I've had no issues with display or function.
- Internal Storage Creep and Windows Updates: Though I'm reasonably careful to use my 64GB MicroSD card, even using to install my programs to where possible, I've still accumulated some data on my internal storage, so I'm under 1GB - which is not enough space for me to get this latest Windows Update. Yes, in the past I've cleared out my previous Windows Updates but I'll try it again and hopefully I can avoid clearing out actual programs. NOTE: Here's a very useful link for cleaning up space on Win10 Systems: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17421/windows-free-up-drive-space . Just went there, and may have found one of my problems in my WindowsSxS (Windows Store) folder.

2/12/17 UPDATE
I continue to use this as my go to on the go Lap-Tab. I'm very content with it. My only desire would be this exact same product in a 4GB RAM version.
+ The battery life has not significantly declined.
+ After finally figuring out how to get it working, a Windows 10 update now allows me to save updates directly to the flash drive, though it would like for you to have 14 GB available. Still a win, though.
+ I've been able to find a replacement power supply here on Amazon.
+/- Connecting to my TV via internet connection has become consistent. I was mistakenly attempting to use the Project feature when I should have been using the Connect feature. It often rejects my first connection attempt but picks up successfully on my second attempt. It gives off a occasional clicking sound when it should be giving a system notification sound, and there is a slight cursor lag which worsens if your internet connection is poor. Still useful enough for display purposes but may get frustrating if you're writing a paper.
- The micro HDMI output port has become loose because of my regular use of it and the fact that it is a micro port which means the amount of connection surface area is low, ergo the weight of the cord alone is enough to put pressure on the port and loosen it. It still works well, but I am careful with it.

"First off, I know Dell computers extremely well because I use them exclusively at work and frequently have to troubleshoot and repair them for my job. That's why I chose to buy a refurbished Dell -- even if it's got problems I know how to fix them. However, even after using every troubleshooting effort known using different monitors, cables, Dell docks etc. I still have no video output from the USB C thunderbolt ports nor the dedicated HDMI port. I have tried every driver old and new, updated all possible updates, did all the YouTube and Dell troubleshooting tips, even upgraded to windows 11 pro and downgraded again.  After finally doing a factory reset with no results I give up. Everything else seems to work fine, and the case is minorly beat up.

Laptop with external monitor capability is useless to me. Returned.

***UPDATE*** I'm adding two stars back because the customer service was prompt to handle the issue and process the return.",
"Most important thing: this is the most cooperative keyboard that I have ever used and I have used computers since the 1980's. Typing on this is wonderful. Setup was a little difficult because I already had a Microsoft Office subscription on my other two computers, so I had choices to make. Setting up Outlook with our e-mail required the help of the tech at our internet server. All in all, this did not take too much time. We purchased this computer to use when we travel, but I am finding it very enjoyable right now, sitting at my kitchen table. For the price this was an excellent purchase for us. UPDATE: THE ""WONDERFUL"" KEYBOARD DIED ABOUT TWO MONTHS AGO. I FINALLY TOOK IT TO THE REPAIR SHOP AND IT CAN BE FIXED FOR JUST ABOUT WHAT I PAID FOR THE COMPUTER, BECAUSE THERE ARE NO PARTS AVAILABLE, AND A NEW COMPATIBLE KEYBOARD WOULD HAVE TO BE FOUND. WARRANTY AND SUPPORT HAVE EXPIRED. SO THIS WAS ACTUALLY A VERY BAD PURCHASE FOR US.",
"I kind of like this computer [despite how flimsy it is ... NEVER drop it] but the problem that keeps arising is disk space. I got the machine to write as I travel and therefore have not saved large files or software on it. HOWEVER of the 27.8 G available I seem to be always confronted with having less than 1G free space. After a long VERY upsetting conversation with HP customer service it seems that this machine is known by them to loose disk space to updates. To fix this they want you to subscribe and pay to recover space or buy more disk space. I am very upset and if I could return this I would. I DO NOT recommend that you buy this computer and that you choose a much more reliable machine that you will not have to pay to use much less find yourself in a position  where you cannot store anymore content including a simple text document. ALSO to reiterate the customer service experience was HORRIBLE.
PS: TOUCH SCREEN?????????",
"I've had this laptop for about six months.  I didn't need anything fancy, just something to access the internet and do some word documents on occasionally.  This fit the bill...until now.  I've been trying for over a week to install the latest Windows 10 update and it keeps failing because it says there's not enough storage and to free up space.  THERE IS NOTHING on this computer other than what came preinstalled by HP and I can't remove any of it.  There is NOTHING in documents, in downloads, in the recycle bin, in pictures,  or music.  I've run the troubleshooter, defragmented, optimized and deleted, uninstalled everything I possibly could and I still don't have enough storage space.  And, every time I check to see what storage I have, I have even less than I did previously.  HP tech support couldn't help me but would be happy to transfer me to software support for a fee.  No thanks...I'll save my money and buy something else.",
"I was excited when I opened the package and saw how compact and lightweight this was. I figured it would be great to take with me to teach classes and workshops. As I tried to go online, I found that pages loaded slowly, many times pictures did not show, and at times it would freeze up on me. I tried sending an Email and it would allow me to put in the address and subject line but would not allow me to write a message. You had to use the Microsoft Edge browser as it would not allow you to download Chrome. I contacted Amazon who connected me with HP; they told me that the computer I owned for two hours ""probably had a corrupted disc or virus"" and then told me it was no longer under warranty and I would have to pay them $49 to have them look at it. I told them I'd rather trash it than pay them to service a brand-new computer. Thankfully, Amazon is allowing me to return it. and I will never again buy a computer from HP.

This review was posted from a working computer, not the junk I bought.",
"Lasted one year, then it blew.  Never again.

Previous Review:

I bought it because I liked the specs, and one of the reviewers said it worked perfectly with Linux.  It comes with Windows 10-S.  The ""S"" stands for ""Satanic"" because it's the Windows way of forcing users to buy their crappy software.

Anyhoo, I tried the Linux demo, but it couldn't find the Wifi card, then I figured, so what?  I'll buy a USB Wifi unit for $15.  So I installed Linux on the whole 32gb HD.  Still no sign of the Wifi.

Next step was to update all of the software, which took 1.5 hours.  After updating the software, the Wifi magically came alive and worked perfectly first try.  An invisible network.

It's not a perfect unit.  There are no pad buttons, so it's kind of squirrelly, but I'll just buy a little portable mouse.

Other than that, it is a noticeably fast little box and it should be great for day trips and road trips and any time I need my laptop and my files and a way to connect to the internet.",
"i wanted to give zero stars, but this won't let me, so I had to click on one star.  I hate this thing.  I guess the price was too good to be true.  Issues started less than a year into having it.  It keeps wanting to download updates but then says there is no space on the hard drive to download.  I finally decided after 5 months to deal with it and tried to free up space as per the computer prompts.  There was barely anything I could delete!  So then I went out and bought an external hard drive.  Still tells me there isn't enough space on the computer hard drive.  So I move a few things (what the computer allows) to the external drive.  STILL NOT ENOUGH SPACE AND I CAN'T DELETE ANYTHING ELSE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I really only use this computer for Facebook (occasionally),buying off Amazon (occasionally) and writing stories to publish that I save to a flash drive, so not even on the computer hard drive.  HOW CAN I NO HAVE ANY SPACE TO DOWNLOAD UPDATES????!!!!!!  I will never buy another HP again.",
"I received my laptop today, on time, and in perfect condition. That’s where the fairytale ends. The computer said that Windows 10 needed to be updated in order to run the iCloud app that I downloaded from the Microsoft Store.  When I tried to update, I got an error message that there was not enough memory. It suggested that I use an external drive to add space. I did everything I was prompted to do, but continued to get the same message. I spent over two hours, adding an external usb drive as instructed. Just before the installation finished each time,  I got the same warning that there’s not enough memory.  Out of 32 gigabytes, less than  one gigabyte was was available. When I started to update, a pop up saying everything was okay and memory was fine. After spending over two hours trying and retrying, canceling S mode, and doing everything I was prompted to do, I give up. The machine is fantastic, and I only wanted to install the iCloud app from the App Store (MS store). I’ll be packing it up tomorrow and sending it back. I use cloud storage, so I thought the 32 gigabytes would at least have enough memory to update the operating system. I love Windows 10, and I love this laptop, but if I can’t update windows, and if I can’t access all my data, then I’ll need to try another machine.",
"I've had this computer since May. It was great for what I needed: email and Microsoft office for work. It doesn't have much hard drive space, so I haven't saved anything to it and I haven't downloaded any new programs. I keep all my music, docs, photos, videos on an external hard drive and connect when needed. This was fine until the recent Windows 10 update. The computer doesn't have enough hard drive space to perform it. I even had a Microsoft Help Desk rep remote into my computer to help me find a way to either clean up disk space or use my external drive to perform the update. Do you know what his solution was? He said that my only option would be to go to the manufacturer and BUY MORE RAM. That's right - HP has created a computer that cannot do the most basic of functions: update it's own software. So I went back to the seller: ""iTech365 (We Record S/N)"" -- who has now engaged me in a never-ending string of emails where they don't listen to the actual problem and keep telling me to troubleshoot things that I've already looked at. Stay away from that seller, you guys. Because if, heaven forbid, you have a problem more than 30 days after purchase, you're screwed.

Note, I bought this computer mid-May. Of COURSE I didn't know about the software space issue till 6 months later. There wouldn't have been an update before then.",
"I purchased this laptop in October 2019. It is now the end of March 2020. Less than six months of owning this thing, and I have hardly used it. I only use it for web-based paperwork for working from home, and only for an average of about 2 hours a week (probably less than that, but I'm being generous here).

Yesterday my wireless adapter component or whatever it's called completely died yesterday. There's no way to connect to the internet without that. Thankfully an IT guy I work with looked at it for me, and was able to give me a USB wireless adaptor to use so that I can still use it for work. He told me it has some hardware going bad already, and I might be able to squeeze another year out of it.

For the short amount of time and few hours of use this computer has seen, that is ridiculous. And stupid me, I didn't buy a warranty.

Also, it has such a small hard drive it doesn't have enough disk space to update Windows 10. It's a nice little computer, but it has some major issues. Very frustrating!",
"I guess I got what I paid for with a cheap laptop. First, it was a pain to take if off of Safety Mode so that I could get Google Chrome on the computer. However, once I took it off Safety Mode, it constantly told me it couldn't update because there wasn't enough memory on the computer, even though I had no files saved and even took Google Chrome off to try and solve it. Then, after having it a year and exactly one month after the warranty expired, the WiFi chip stopped working and I couldn't access the internet on it. Geek Squad told me it would cost $80 to fix the chip with them, which is almost half of what I paid for the laptop in the first place. Even before the WiFi chip broke, I had trouble using Zoom. I used to find HP a reliable brand, but frankly this laptop was a disappointment and kind of a waste of money as now it's just a simple word processor unless I'm ready to shell out to fix it. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this model, and I wish I'd gone with something else.",
"Add a big (low profile) 3.1 USB drive to it and you have a little monster, BUT Windows will not be able to update for very long. MOST apps will not allow you to install them on another drive either, so as long as you like it AS-IS and just looking for something with its stock features, add the extra drive for files (like photos) and you'll be OK. I was really in love with this thing at the start, but it ran out of C drive space and I can't do anything about it. Can't move potions of Windows and it already come running in compressed format so no more solutions. This machine and others like it were A BIG MISTAKE BY THE THE CREATORS, as they could have easily stuck at least a 128 GB memory chip where the 32 sits and it would be an awesome machine! I'd buy another or two! What a waste. Anyway, if you need a machine fast and don;t have the bucks for something immediately, this will open docs and print and get email and everything else, but I'd consider it a temp machine for being in a jam, and not a long term use machine, as you can't update Windows and sooner than later the thing will be a security threat for you. Best if you don't need to take it out of S-Mode. For those who can't use S-mode, I highly suggest you get one with at least a 128 GB chip and add a couple of 256 to the ports.",
"I purchased this laptop on July 15th 2019.

Same story as several of the other one star reviewers. Got computer out of the box…powered it up…black spot on the screen. I should’ve known to just send it back right away but I foolishly thought the black spot isn’t that bad…I can work with this. But it began spreading to other parts of the screen. I called HP and they sent a repair box to my home to have the laptop shipped to their repair center in Texas.

A week or so goes by and I get a note saying that there is an internal crack in the screen. They declared it accidental damage outside of the coverage of my warranty and requested $378.46 to make the repair. Me giving HP twice what it originally cost to buy the laptop is not happening.

Because HP made me send it to them in their special repair box, I have the box that it originally arrived in—there is not a scuff, ding, or dent on this thing. So I am at an utter loss to figure out when this damage occurred—it was a fulfilled by Amazon product through a third party seller. Did HP ship it out like that, did something happen at the fulfillment center. Either way, this shouldn't be my problem. HP disagreed.

At any rate, I would have liked to hope that HP would stand behind their products better, but apparently I was naïve. I did not damage this laptop. I think it is ludicrous to ask someone to pay twice what they originally paid for the laptop just to have what I should’ve had in the first place. They have managed to lose a proud HP customer of over a decade who has three other HP computers in the home. All I wanted was a functioning laptop without a crack in the screen and HP failed.

You are playing roulette if you buy this laptop. I will not be purchasing another HP Laptop.",
"i have only had this laptop a couple of days so far i love it. it came in windows 10 s mode i did switch out of it. to do that just google it for instructions. first time start up was a breeze and a program called cortina walks you threw everything. its fast with my 5g wifi it dosn't skip and studder. i bought the new one when you purchase this laptop make sure you are buying the new on not the refubished ones it makes a world of diffrence. if something changes i will update.

it is august 2nd 2019 and every once in a while when browsing the internet the screen will go black and I have to hold down the esc key and try to move the mouse to the x to get it to come back on at this point I still love my laptop but I don't think it will last long and I have down graded the stars from 5 to 3 I will review again soon

It is June 23 2020 now the laptop goes to sleep when closing the top and doesn't wake up till you hit the power button and it goes threw the main screen like your turning it on after being shut down and it now gives me a warning screen that I'm running out of space",
"I love the size and weight of this Windows Laptop.  Since I only do research and check my email messages, it is convenient and ideal.  Important caveats:  1) If you already have virus protection software (other than McAfee that was offered for an additional fee if purchasing this particular laptop), you will not be able to download your preferred software because it is in 'S' mode (please look up its meaning).  Unless one is computer-savvy, a low-tech person will not be happy if they are not able to find someone to remove 'S' mode.  Downloading any type of software --  is blocked, period.  I have to take it elsewhere to remove 'S' mode in near future.  2) HP website is not user-friendly.  Options for what you need is not readily available.  A 'Community Forum' may be impressive to others but I was not impressed when I could not easily navigate in order to find what I needed.  3) Although I just bought the laptop a few days ago, after putting in info for warranty, laptop warranty had only 4 months left (?!?!).  I tried to chat but after inputting dispute warranty info, I never connected to anyone and it buffered for a couple of minutes.  I'll see how it works out if 'S' mode can easily be removed, to include its performance.  Besides not easily connecting with HP to resolve my needs and having to drive elsewhere to remove 'S' mode, I hope the computer performs well, especially for the reasonable price.",
"I was hoping that this machine would behave well under Linux, and so far, it has.

Everything works. Sound, GPU, Wifi, battery detection, suspend.

It's exactly what I needed. A simple, small, light, long battery life laptop to do software development on at a Denny's without lugging around my very heavy Thinkpad and unplugging it from everything.

Keyboard does not have a lot of travel or feedback, but strangely, it's actually a LOT better than most cheap laptops. Touch typists will like this machine, as long as they aren't mechanical keyboard cultists.

I was wary of HP machines in recent years as I had heard they had gotten quite bad, but this has been a surprisingly good experience so far.

Not only is secure boot easily disabled and doesn't require an admin password (looking at you, Acer), but it also provides legacy/CSM BIOS emulation support, in case UEFI isn't your thing.

eMMC storage speed is phenominal, even if there's only 32GB of space. I'm using a heavily compressed Btrfs partition for my root filesystem, so I can manage.

This machine exceeded my expectations. It's not perfect, the build quality, while better than I expected, still leaves a bit to be desired. It seems to attract crumbs and grime like a magnet, which is annoying, and the touchpad is NOT particularly sensitive, which gets annoying quickly. You need more pressure than you should to get its attention so you can move the cursor.

HP, if you're reading this, you've done well. A slight thing that you did in one previous machine that you should do again: allow booting from microSD. That's a very useful feature.",
"Bought this for my parents July 9, 2019. It looked like an affordable solution since all they do is access the internet, play a few card/word games, and use Microsoft Word fairly regularly. That it had Office 365 included made it very appealing for the price. The case is a cheap plastic, but adequate for their needs and they typically take decent care of their technology.

There were a couple of hiccups with lag when we first got it set up, but those were overcome and it worked fine for a bit with no phone calls requesting support. *sigh of relief*

UNTIL... three months after purchase, my dad complained he was unable to connect to the internet. They had been away caring for family for three months, so I assumed reconnecting to their home network was the problem and chalked it up to user error. I tried to walk him through troubleshooting and we determined he needed to update drivers, but since there isn't an ethernet port and my schedule wouldn't allow me to troubleshoot in person, I sent him to Geek Squad for resolution. They determined the network adapter had failed and that updating drivers was inadequate to fix the problem. I arranged to get the computer from my parents to process the warranty (we live in different cities) because I thought I could do it faster/more efficiently if I had it in front of me. WRONG.

When I put in the serial number to verify the warranty, HP's records showed the warranty began June 28, 2018 and expired August 1, 2019. This computer was listed as new. Now, I did dispute the warranty status and received an email from HP indicating they had updated the terms of the warranty, but every attempt to invoke said warranty to get the computer repaired or replaced gets me in a loop of troubleshooting and when I use the automated system to check the warranty status, it still shows it to be expired. I don't know if it would be easier to use warranty if it were listed as active because I don't have that choice. But at the moment, I am waiting for a phone call from HP (which also had to be requested online) to see what happens next. Seemed like a great opportunity to share my experience thus far.

Now I realized this is a budget laptop and the price was ""too good to be true"" -- but that seemed all the more reason to write this review. Whether it be quality control or luck of the draw, my experience with the HP Stream does not make me want to buy another HP product. Ever. The hours I have spent on this to date are gone forever. I hope I save someone else the trouble. You live; you learn.",
"I recently was in the market for a new workbook / laptop, I have owned several high-end Macbooks in the past but was in search of something simply for browsing, streaming and word editing without spending hundreds if not thousands of dollars.

I was reluctant at first to purchase this product because of Windows 10, but once you get the hang of it it really isn't that bad. The laptop comes preloaded with Windows S mode but prior to the previous review all you have to due is enable the full Windows 10 version in the settings which does not cost you a penny more other than using more store. For example with nothing other than Windows 10 full version + google chrome my laptop only has about 8GBs left of free space which in and of itself is not surprising.

This laptop comes with 2x USB 2.0 inputs, while they're not 3.0 like some of the more expense chromebooks I don't really have the need for this as most of my information / data is stored on the cloud, which this includes 1 year free with up-to 1TB of storage, a great freebie.

The laptop also comes with Windows Office Home edition for a full year for free which was a great surprise and money saver. It also comes standard with a HDMI output and micro sd which is amazing to help bump up the storage on this little guy. Currently have the micro SD slot filled with a 64BG chip from an old gopro and have just loaded it up with movies, music and TV shows.

My favorite thing about this laptop other than the cost, has to be the size, weight and battery life. Compared to some of the bigger counterparts offered this is absolutely perfect for close range use like when on a plane, train or back-seat of the car because the screen is just big enough it doesn't hurt your eyes staring at it for too long.

My least favorite thing so far about this laptop has to be the screen not having a good anti-glare setup on it and while this isn't that bad to deal with it, it does get annoying in heavily lighted areas :(

Otherwise, for the cost of this laptop I would happily purchase another, between the laptop + extended 2yr warranty the total for this product was roughly $210. Best $210 I have ever spent without the hassle of worrying about spending $700-$1500 on a laptop and picking the wrong one or disliking the product over all.

If this laptop lasts me for the 2 years of my warranty than that is fine by me this is the perfect little travel companion for anyone who is on the road and tired of lugging around big heavy laptops that battery life barely exceed 6 hours when using for streaming more or less data editing.

This laptop while streaming Netflix/Hulu/Etc, seems to last me about 10-12 hours without dying! I have yet to drain the battery significantly while doing word processing on it.

10/10 would recommend for anyone who needs a little laptop to travel with, or something for home use when you want to sit on the sofa and not have to be plugged in or burn your legs to a crisp!",
"I'm writing this review from this very laptop I've had for all of 2 hours. First and foremost, I already have firefox downloaded and the S mode disabled. Took like 10 minutes. Went to mozilla, tried to download, then a popup asked me if I wanted to disable S mode for free. Select yes, let it do its thing and now I have regular windows 10. Peasy.

This thing is a miniature version of our HP15. The keyboard is great quality, nearly identical to our HP15 which doesn't have the premium keyboard. But it lacks the 10 digit numerical pad to the right side, which I don't particularly miss. There are number keys 1-0 up top here. I don't do a lot of data entry, and I'm sure as hell not going to be doing any mobile banking in the middle of a Starbucks. U do that stuff at home where no one can see your keystrokes anyway, or hack your computer. I'm really able to use it well as a touch typist, it supplies a light click touchback with predictable force across the different keys. Touch typists know this can be important. Little things like sticky or wonky keys can really mess up your flow. It's pleasantly quiet with a polite click rather than the intrusive clack clack of some keyboards. The mousepad is quite responsive. Not top notch, mind you, but for this little thing, very good and quite usable. It does two finger scrolling more precisely than the more expensive HP15, which is to say, not stellar but ok. You can also left and right click with light touch or with pushing the mouse pad like a button. This feature is quite sensitive and impressively functional for this size and price. Though do what everyone else does and get a good wireless mouse.

It of course, is much smaller, lighter than the HP15 (which I use as comparison because we happen to own it, and its similarity to this model) and great for on the go. No DVD/CD drive, fewer ports and smaller 11.5"" screen are mostly responsible for that. But perhaps most significantly, so is the lack of a real hard drive. It has solid state memory (sturdier, lighter than ""normal"" hard drives with discs and moving parts inside), which also means it doesn't have very much. 32gb built in. Pretty underwhelming. It does have a micro SD expansion slot, and some of these micro cards pack quite a bit of memory, depending on how much you want to pay, and they can get pricey. I've seen them go up to 400 GB. Keep in mind that some essential programs - like Windows - can only be stored on internal memory and can't use an SD card. It has 2 USB ports and an HDMI port, so you could use an external hard drive or a flash drive for extra memory if you wanted. Comes with 1 yr free Microsoft cloud storage with up to 1 TB. Never used it, haven't signed up for it. No idea how much it costs after 1 yr. Not sure I trust it, either...but anyway, its an option.

It also comes with 1 year of microsoft office, which is pretty darn sweet cuz that sweet suite is expensive. Haven't used the most recent iteration, so can't comment on that, but if its anything like it was in 2010-2012 should be good stuff.

It looks like it can run 2-3 apps at the same time, depending on the app of course. I wouldn't use it for anything but ""light"" gaming. It can struggle with its whopping (read: not whopping) 4 GB RAM. Has an intel celeron N4000 processor, so about 1.1ghz. Fast, but quite limited by its unimpressive 4 GB. Which, I wouldn't get any laptop that had less than that, and many of the competitors do have less at very similar prices. If you're looking for a powerhouse, high performance machine, look elsewhere. My intended use is for on the go light browsing, checking emails, voice chatting without lugging a large heavy laptop around. I barely notice the weight in my bag. It seems to fit the bill perfectly so far. I'll try to come back and make comments as I have it for a bit longer.
5/2/19 Update: Still loving this thing. Corrected some mistakes above like the processor speed. I have been using this thing, surfing, typing, changing settings for the past 1.5 -2 hrs from full battery, and is now at 88%. This battery is really impressing me so far. Half expecting that as I use this more, and the battery becomes more drained, how fast the battery drains changes. You've likely noticed these battery inconsistencies in your devices before. You know that after XX% on the battery, its all downhill from there, discharges quickly after that. We'll see if this does that. Will leave on standby overnight, see where the % is tomorrow. Also have yet to try camera for skype, alexa, etc.
5/21/19: No battery inconsitency. Speed of drain seems constant and predictable. I have left this thing on standby for over a week with only about 12% drop in power. Very impressive. The HP15 would have been dead after a few days on standby. Also, the more I use the mouse and keyboard, the more impressed I become with them. I said above the mouse in particular is ""not stellar but ok"". I take this back. Like a new phone, it takes a little getting used to, but I now find myself using a wireless mouse less and less and just using the built in mousepad. Sensitive and accurate. I highly recommend this laptop, I've been very impressed with it so far. Just be sure you know what you'll be using it for and its limitations and you shouldn't be disappointed. I would buy it again in a heartbeat.",
"Purchased March 2021: I am in the process of contacting Razer support without success. In the past few months, the track pad has gotten tighter and tighter to where it will no longer click anywhere on the pad.

The laptop also runs extremely hot and the keyboard cannot be touched during a gaming episode (I haven't gamed with it in ages because I am afraid it's going to explode). I have primarily used the laptop for school interspersed with relatively low impact games like Kerbal Space Program or Civilization on lower settings. The games run very poorly, the laptop runs super hot, and the trackpad has died.... all in about a year since purchase. Pretty unacceptable for a $2000 laptop - not to mention that the battery seems like it's swollen and potentially poses a genuine risk to users.

Please contact me, Razer, so that I can update this review based on what I have heard is great customer service. I'd like to get the problem resolved so I can use the laptop like normal again.",

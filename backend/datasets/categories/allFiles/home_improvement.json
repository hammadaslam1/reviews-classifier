The units are very well made and come with just about every switch/outlet adapter conceivable. The instructions were sparse and it was only after about 5 plates that I discovered it is easier to mount the switches to the unit first BEFORE attaching the plate to the electrical box. Also, I would recommend running a thin bead of caulk in between the rubber gasket and the wall. Finally, I also used a small amount of caulk over the screw openings to prevent water from getting in at those locations.",

This is a small lamp and is a nice accent item but if you're looking to use it as a reading lamp, you might need to get brighter bulbs and elevate it. Alternatively, it can be used as a pretty effective night light if you have elderly folk who need some light at night to get around... It does look really nice in my bar area and gives it a neat ambience without taking up much space. I was looking for something small and this works very well for my needs.\nUpdated : I liked this so much, I got a second one. Takes standard chandelier bulbs. Warm lighting.",

They are tiny, which is just what I wanted, fit perfectly in the spots where I needed a small lamp, and are very classic looking.  However, that's where the compliments end.  The shade is held in place by the bulb - you put the shade on, then screw in the bulb.  They take special small bulbs with a small base like flame chandelier bulbs, but shorter and round, which I ordered when I bought the lamps as someone else mentioned.  These bulbs are not very sturdy and the shade fits so loosely that with any contact at all, it tips off its base and hits the bulb.  This has caused the bulb to break off from its base so the light doesn't work and is somewhat hazardous as well.  Over the 3 years I had these lamps, all 3 of them have had this issue at least once and they in rooms that only get used 3-4 times each year.  I have now shifted to regular sturdy flame-shaped bulbs which stick out of the top of the shade a little but seem more able to withstand bumps from the shade.  I am considering completely replacing them, this is too much effort and the bulbs are not cheap!  Choose wisely.",

If you're like me and looking for a space saving lamp for beside your bed then these are for you. Also, people were saying they were dull but I have no issue with the light they give off. I got 5W LED's and the two lamps together give off enough light for me. You could probably use one next to a bed but it wouldn't illuminate much of the room. This photo was taken with both lamps on at night and as you can see, there's ample light. You can also see their size compared to my bed.

The switch is describe as rotary in the description, and I assumed this meant the twisty knob on the socket. It is not--it is an inline switch which in fairness does twist. This won't work for me as I need something I can easily find and quickly turn on in the dark, in time to see the caller ID on my phone. This would involve too much fumbling. When it arrived the inner product box showed crush damage. Unfortunately, the shade had been crushed inside as well. It should never have been sent out with obvious damage to the box, without inspection, but that would slow things down at the warehouse, wouldn't it (note: the outer box was not damaged so it was shipped that way). I will return it, but it is a shame as it is such a beautiful tiny lamp for next to my bedroom phone.\n\nUpdate: We initiated an exchange for this and got the new lamp in 2 days. There was a little damage to the box but on the base end not the shade end. The shade was fine. We like it so much we decided to use it in another location where finding the switch quickly in the dark is not a issue. So we are completely happy with it now. Doesn't seem to be a problem of the shade getting too hot as one reviewer mentioned. Maybe they were using a bulb with too many watts. Works fine with the recommended 40 watt bulb. You can always go to LED for less heat or more light.",

It is great for an accent lamp or a small bedside table which is what I got it for. It is compact for moving.\n\nI chose a GE Lighting 22239 Energy-Smart LED 4.5-watt, 350-Lumen light bulb to use with it. Found it here on Amazon for a pretty decent price.\n\nYes, the bulb extends a bit over the top of the cover. This could be a bad thing if you need to reach over the lamp to turn it off or reach over it in general. I tend not to mind as the bulb I chose doesn\u2019t burn hot at all. I found this out by accident when the lamp fell over and I accidentally touched the bulb. At that point it hadn\u2019t been on that long.\n\nI purposely left it on for over eight (8) hours, and wrapped the palm of my hand over the light bulb. Not cold, but not hot. It was \u201clukewarm\u201d \u2013 like tap water. So, with regard to the lamp burning hot \u2013 with the bulb I got \u2013 it doesn\u2019t. If it does, I would also look at the wiring and outlet. Again, this is my personal experience with this type of lamp and bulb combination.\n\nThe switch is awkwardly placed. I do have to position the cord carefully around to access it. This works because I do have a small area where the lamp is so that isn\u2019t too much of an issue.\n\nIt is lightweight so moving it isn\u2019t too much work or hassle.\n\nIt isn\u2019t too bad of a lamp for the price.",

It wouldn\u2019t work well as a nightstand lamp or a table lamp in a larger room, but think glorified nightlight and you\u2019d be golden.\nAlso worth noting that the shade is very flimsy and kinda puckers weird, but bougie on a budget amiright?",

The light bulb it requires is 1x40w Type B E12 Candelabra Base Bulb which is not a regular light bulb you would usually have in your house. It is more expensive to buy the pack of lightbulbs than the lamp. I mainly bought it because it\u2019s my favorite color. Wish I could return it but I already threw the box out. I don\u2019t even know if it actually works because I haven\u2019t acquired a lightbulb yet. It\u2019s just sitting there. :/ I was super excited to use but unfortunately I didn\u2019t notice the light bulb type required on the description. ?????",

Everything worked as it should.\n\nMajor cons:\n\n1) You cannot MANUALLY disable motion detection lights. It is automatically controlled by a day/night sensor. You also CANNOT set the brightness when they go off. You can only MANUALLY set the brightness if you turn them on manually.\n\n2) If you use 24/7 recording, you CANNOT screenshot or record video to your phone UNLESS you have a motion detected event. Otherwise, the options will not appear in the app for that day and you are screwed.\n\n3) The camera does not record sharp images past 25ft. Once you get that far, forget getting a clear image both in day or night. It's meant to record things up close.\n\n4) The app itself can crash on android and require a complete system reset on the camera. It's happened just a couple of times, but still something to consider. It also lacks some basic functionality.",

                "review_body": "This is my second device; purchased first one from a certain warehouse store. Running it for 18 months on the side of our property.\n\nThe quality of the device feels solid straight out of the box, it\u2019s a mix of high-quality plastic and metal. The adapter mount is well designed, no fiddling around with wire nuts on the top of a ladder. The device looks to be sealed well against the outdoor elements.\n\nPrior to final install, I use an old power cord to set the device up indoors. That way pairing with Wi-Fi, functionality and power cycling can be checked before final installation.\n\nDevice setup is straightforward through the mobile application. From a security perspective the application is basic by today\u2019s standards, it is largely orientated around Feit\u2019s home automation ecosystem. Smart switches, plugs, lighting, controls and sensors etc.\n\nThe application is rock solid on my old Android mobile device, either from within my home network or away from home, I can view live feeds in real time with only a few seconds of initialization delay. However, once in operation you see some caveats with the motion detector in the device.\n\nFirst, it isn\u2019t a surveillance device; it is merely a motion sensor light with a camera to capture and record the event that triggered the motion sensor. It will do continuous capture; its value is questionable.\n\nI used the device on the perimeter of my property, approx. 12ft off the ground. It replaced an existing motion sensor light. Results were mixed, numerous false alarms with tree libs and shrubs blowing in the wind, snow, tree shadows, cats and squirrels triggering the sensor. I ended up turned off the real time event push notifications. I could see it useable in a confined space, alleyway, between buildings or where you need a push notification for someone at a doorway requesting access, since the two-way audio is useful. I wouldn\u2019t recommend the device in high traffic areas or areas where the environment and surrounds have the potential to dynamically change in the field of view.\n\nMy second device I\u2019ve installed over the garage door facing outward from the property, it detected the FEDEX truck passing the driveway. Detected event was 70ft from the device, on the lowest distance of the three preset motion detect zones, still questioning the consistency and reliability of the motion detector.\n\nThe price point was initially justified as requiring no monthly subscription, however other vendors have released more robust security and surveillance solutions using AI at a much lower price point. At around $150, its value proposition is questionable 18 months later.\n\nYou cannot really use the device as a tool to forewarn of illicit behavior in real time, there are too many false positives with the notifications, I got tired of looking at shadows, snow and wildlife, I disabled the push notifications. At this point with the hundreds of events photographically captured on the internal SD card, knowing exact details regarding genuine property invasion would be extremely hard work.\n\nIts strengths are its ability to quickly live stream multiple continuous views, switch the light on/off, two-way talk and record the live stream. Its IR night capability and ability to integrate with other Feit devices in the Feit app are a strong point. You may get some mileage from playing around with sensor orientation, sensitivity and motion control zones within the software. For perimeter protection and asset surveillance there are better products out there.",

                "review_body": "this is a 6 month review. and i have had EXTENSIVE ISSUES WITH THESE CAMERAS\n\nfirst, TERRIBLE customer support if you ring or email them. They acknowledged my complaint and then never followed up. I have pinged them 3x since and no response from feit. I've always called and was hung up on.\nsecond, the app is absolutely horrible. its always stuck in a spiral of encryption(loading) and fails to load 90% of the time. i get anxiety everytime i open app because I dont know if its going to work or not.\n\n'recording' feature: you have to reformat the SD card EVERY TIME it gets full or the camera will freak out and stop recording any events rendering your camera pretty much useless. its SUPPOSE to record over old footage, but the camera never does what its suppose to. Also. good luck trying to retrieve or view the images or video on your computer. feit uses some weird formatting for their footage and i've spent hours trying to convert to different file types so i can see the images on my computer but no success. i ended up just formatting the card. i received no useable footage from this camera despite having a critical need.\n\nSet up is a nightmater!!! im not even talking about the complexity of installing the cameras to your home. i'm talking about the software connection after you've done all the manual labor. feit requires a step where the camera uses a qr code to connect to the app from your phone but the feit camera SUCKS and wont read it's own app qr code. You can also try wifi and bluetooth which have also failed me after 3 dozen attemps. I am not exagerating that I attempted to connect one of these cameras for over a 1 week. I went back everyday to reset, scan, and connect only to get no where. it's super frustrating because you might be on a ladder or roof trying hold your phone perfect center to the camera for minutes each connection attempt. it's tiring and dangerous. the qr code takes several minutes to 'register' if it ever does. I got lucky one day it registered the qr code.\n\nthere are so many issues hardware wise, app wise, and connection wise that these cameras are in fact an absolute waste of money. I am currently switching to nest and will set fire to these dam cameras.",

A few months ago I took a chance on a solar security light similar in design to this unit and it has really worked great, but did have a couple of quirks... so I decided to try different manufacturers for others I needed.\n\nThis Deepn unit is a very nice security light. I used wall mount for it and it was a piece of cake. Due to the strength of the brightness, this light is designed to be mounted higher than the other one I have. I placed it on our barn about 18 feet high.\n\n I like \u201cMode 1\u201d in that you get 30% brightness all night, but it jumps to 100% if triggered by motion. The motion detection field of view on this light is a little better than my other light. The old light wouldn\u2019t pick up motion right under it, only around the periphery... but this one does OK.\n\nThe unit charges easily, even on cloudy days and the light easily goes all thru the night. Brightness is very good. This light is a little more expensive than my other light, but is also slightly larger with about 50% more lighting power... so not out of line pricewise.",

There is a setting where it alternates between different phases of brightness when the light is on, it also has very responsive motion activation, so if you're walking past it and it's in one of its lower light phases, it will brighten up to show you the way.\n\nI have been very interested in solar power and I have experimented with dozens of different products, from tiny solar powered toys to large panels and arrays, and I can say confidently that this is a top quality solar light.\n\nObviously with any solar light, the amount of exposure you give it means everything. It is said that a cheap solar panel at the right angle will give more power than an expensive one at a bad angle, and with this tenet in mind I did look up exactly the best way to mount this for full exposure. I may end up adjusting the position as the seasons change, but the mounting equipment included will make that very easy.\n\nBy obtaining light each day, this product will stay lit all night. It'll shut itself off once dawn has returned and it will begin to absorb electricity again. It is very exciting to have this free source of electricity, even if it is just one light. However that one light is extremely bright, and that low heat, low energy LED looks incredible in the foliage of the backyard at night. This is truly a wonderful product and I hope to continue to rely further on solar.",

                "review_body": "We used this as an outdoor light during and after Hurricane Idalia when we were out of power for a week. The light is bright, the solar panel is huge, and so we moved it from its 'permanent' location to inside the garage where we were doing our cooking on little grills and sometimes hanging out when the weather cooled off some. Which wasn't often, but this did work really well. Motion detection is excellent and this thing lights up the night. Looking at it directly left white streaks in my vision, so A+ for brightness!\nBeing in a completely dark, silent neighborhood and knowing that people were wandering about looking for houses to loot and generators to steal was really freaky. This light gave me a lot more peace of mind than I'd have had without it. It isn't hyper sensitive to where a leaf falling will trigger it, but it triggered on my dogs and my family walking nearby. Knowing that this would light up a looter helped us all sleep better at night.\nThis was easy to hang up in our garage. We put it on a peg. It's lightweight for its size, so it hung easily on a larger sized hook through the holes in the back. We reinstalled it to its 'permanent' place and will take it down for the next hurricane, lol.\nMy only complaint is that this sat in the sun, bright, hot, super intense sunlight from dawn until dusk to charge and it didn't catch enough charge to last throughout the night. It did about 5 hours of brightness with us going back and forth constantly before giving up the ghost. If you're in a busy neighborhood and want constant light, I don't know how well this will work for you. If you're in a more rural area or want this to light up poles on a farm or the shed or the side of the house where there isn't constant movement at night, then this would be perfect. My complaint really isn't a complaint, I guess, just a warning about the life of the light and how suitable it is for certain situations.\nI do plan to buy again to put one on our shed and one on the backside of our house that leads to the yard. One of my dogs is getting older and losing his vision a bit, so that will help him out. It'll also let us know if anyone creeps inside the fence.\nThe price is perfect and the light is excellent quality. For a home or as a prepper item, it's perfect.",

As a favor to him, I ordered this light for his side yard and he can't stop talking about how much brighter his yard is. He has several overgrown fruit trees that have overtaken the yard and there are dark areas where he just can't see into at night. Now, this solar light gives him a lot of range and coverage where he can easily see if anyone lurks amongst his fruit trees. It didn't take much time for him to assemble and install the light fixture. He's so good at assembling these lights that he looks forward to getting additional lights for his enormous backyard. He's convinced that these types of solar lights is the only way to go especially with the frequent power outages we've been experiencing on the island.",

Worked out well and was quite reasonable in cost. The lamp needs to get some sun - so thought needs to go into the positioning of the lamp - i.e. I doubt this would be suitable on the side of a house - unless it can be angled towards the sun somehow.

The blower/vacuum works great, but  once you own it they've got you by the cajones and you'll be replacing these bags, or repairing them, within every 2 dozen or so uses.  You'll only be able to repair it yourself if you're lucky enough to have the seam split or zipper break at the end of the zipper run.  This (pic) happened ONLY after a few uses...  What frustrates me the most is these bags/zippers have become cheaper in quality over time and I'm guessing I know the reason why.  Charge an extra 10 bucks and put in a beefier zipper and a few more stitches for pete's sake. The zippers are so small and delicate for this kind of use that they clog almost immediately.  You have to constantly babysit them by knocking out any debris and even lubricating them with some silicone...... They zipper splines fall out of alignment repeatedly so you're having to move them back into place with a toothpick or paper clip (I really enjoy doing this, don't get me wrong...cuz I definitely  have the time and patience to fiddle with this kind of thing)......OR just suck it up and buy 2-3 replacements for the year and be annoyed like me.",

It's now Nov 22 and the bag is already ripped and blowing out of the rear near the zipper. The corner seems to be the weak spot. If I buy another one then I could have just purchased another blower that came with a new bag. I'll be looking for an alternative brand in the future. That realls stinks because I like the blower/vacuum itself. Just the bag sucks (no pun intended).\n\nMy old bag (no not her the one on the vacumm lol) finally gave out after a few great years. Blower still runs strong so I ordered this new bag. Fits perfectly. The strap is a little long and if I don't use it then it gets sucked up in to the tube. Not a huge problem but something to note for safety. What I didn't care for which it seems many do is that the zipper only opens on the far end now instead of around the 2 sides. This makes it harder to empty. I now have to scoop the leaves out with my hands first to empty the bag. I didn't need to do this with the old one. The old style opening on 2 sides made it much easier to empty. Otherwise it's great.",

There are two main updates from the original that are definite improvements: the zipper and the attachment collar. The zipper is more heavy-duty than the one on the original, which is a very welcome improvement since the zipper is usually the first thing to break. Additionally, the zipper no longer wraps around the edge of the bag, but is straight across the bottom. That is also a plus for durability.\n\nThe attachment collar now has a quick-release system so you no longer need to twist it on/off. The quick release works well, both in terms of ease of release as well as remaining firmly in place during use.\n\nMy only quibble is that the new zipper, while better than the old one, is still not as sturdy as I would have liked. To maintain as long of a lifespan as possible, it's a good idea to lube the zipper teeth with wax (or something similar) to keep it operating smoothly.",

For me, the most important features I look for now are 1) a strong spray 2) consistent warm water and 3) sturdy seat.\n\nThis ix hybrid hits all three points for me.  I tried other brands in this price range and the spray is either too soft, or the water doesn't stay warm throughout.  I took a chance on the ix because we have their other model JX in another house.  That one's been great so we were excited to try this new one for our home in Vegas.\n\nThe spray is solid, the temp stays warm and it feels sturdy enough.  The lid doesn't feel flimsy either.  My wife prefers the regular rear wash and I like the stronger rear+ mode.  I wasn't aware it had a dryer when I bought it, but it's on there as well.  The blue led light is just the icing on the cake.  Great product at any price.",

Small plastic pieces started to fall off about 4 months after we installed it and I couldn't figure out where they were coming from until a hose started slowly leaking.  The hose that enters the bidet finally gave out one day and water was spraying all over the bathroom.  It was a good thing that we were still at home as it would have flooded the bathroom.  I reached out to Alpha and have had no response back as to any warrenty or if problem can be fixed.  Very disappointed.",

I love it besides that, the seat stays warm all the time unless on eco mode, I love the remote & it also had 3 buttons on the side of seat.  Easy to install but you have to have a gfi outlet near toilet, I had to install one like most people will so that is an expense you need to factor in. Overall all love it, warm water, warm toilet seat, night light, air dryer but in my experience you won't fully get rid of toilet paper.",

Once in awhile, it initially shoots a cold blast of water, but for the most part, it is warm. The temperature,  water pressure and position is adjustable to one\u2019s needs.\n\nThe seat doesn\u2019t fit as perfectly as we hoped on our toilet, but we have since gotten accustomed to it and it doesn\u2019t leak, so there aren\u2019t any major problems except appearance when opened. The soft close seats are very nice.\n\nThe blue light is nice, especially at night, so there is no need to turn on any lights, especially for the male members of our household.\n\nIt also comes with a remote holder that can be affixed on the wall nearby for easy use.\n\nI feel it is worth every dollar we paid and seriously considering adding another to our guest bathroom.",

First, nobody seemed to want to help me.  I felt like they are just hoping I will stop following up until the warranty is expired.  To me it seems like these things are not designed to last, they want customers that provides residual income  The problem with that is they are wasting resources and filling up landfills.  I think we all should demand quality long lasting products that last decades\nand not accept cheap easy to break products.  I asked them to send me a link for a troubleshooting manual or a detailed wiring diagram.  They make sure that we pay all the shipping cost involved with the warranty so the charge $35 and they say they will charge an additional  $50 if they decide it needs to be steam cleaned  All I know to do is wipe it with Clorox wipe but I don't want to submerse in water and void the warranty. This makes me nervous because they could determine that this is not covered under the warranty  I wish they would just send me a troubleshooting manual and replace whatever part is bad.

I called the service line and got a human voice very quickly.  The technician suggested that I point the remote toward the bidet rather than toward the wall.  When I did, it worked fine.  The technician suggested that the walls must be absorbing the signal rather than letting it bounce.  The commode area is small but had a fairly dark brown flat coat of paint when we bought the place and the explanation made sense, especially when  we put a mirror on the wall in front of the commode and the remote worked well when pointed at the mirror.  I believe a coat of semi-gloss pant, preferably a lighter color, will solve the problem.

Metal bushings were a little large to fit through the mounting holes of the bowl and had to use a dremel to enlarge the hole.\nThe warm water and seat are great.  The oscillating feature on this biden washes me completely leaving no cling-ons and leaves me clean. Front wash is nice and gentle besides being warm.  It auto shuts off after a minute.\nThe drying fan is noisy and pretty much useless.  It does blow warm air but after 3 minutes still wet.\nHighly recommend this biden butt washer.",

Holy Crap!  No pun intended, but these are definitely the holy grail of bottom maintenance.  The power of the washing wand almost makes me want to linger for a 2nd cycle every time!  Plus, I always feel clean down there, like I'm taking a new shower every time I poo.  In the past I've been gradually becoming more and more aware of how ineffective TP alone is on my poopy bum, so now I am completely satisfied that my cornholio is clean and fresh.  This is a fantastic bidet with so many features and it doesn't feel cheaply done at all.  Between the heated seat and multiple power-wash options and a blow dryer!  Although the blow dryer isn't as pleasant as it sounds.  Imagine blowing poopy-smelling air up to your nostrils.  It gets the job done though, and drys your bum so your TP isn't as wet when you wipe.  Yes, I still use TP to make sure everything got scoured away.  Sometimes, clay-like poo, doesn't get completely removed and must be re-done, but most of the time it does.  And who doesn't enjoy a 2nd round of power washing into your hole of poo?  Very enjoyable!  Thanks for making such a great product.  Extremely satisfied.",

One challenge I encountered during the installation, which I was not expecting, was that the supplied T-adapter just would not thread completely onto the supply line. As I wasn't certain if the problem was the T- adapter or the supply line, I bought a new supply line and a T-adapter with a valve. When I received both it was apparent that the supplied T-adapter was the issue and that there must be a problem with the threading on the inlet as it only allows for a couple of turns (and there was no way I was cross threading anything). With the new T-adapter I was able to finish the installation without issue.\n\nSo overall, it seems to function well, but I have limited experience so far and will update this review if there is an issue. I am, however, perturbed I needed to order a separate part to finish the installation.",

Remote is larger than I expected but that doesn't matter. Wish the night lite was auto, just stays on all nite and day but not really an issue. Really wish my toilet style was oblong so that there was more of an opening to sit. The round is has a smaller seat to compensate for the attachments but still cool. Round seat set up, probably wouldn't be comfortable for someone of not average size. Nite light is not as bright as the picture my camera really brought out the whiteness of the bowl, I feel it's the perfect brightness at nite,it's not blinding.

Controls are very intuitive... except I wish they'd allow you to default your settings (most people prefer oscillation which it has, but you have to remember to hit the button twice each time).\n2.  Warm water, just for a bit though, but enough....  BioBidet is unlimited on warm water.\n3.  Love the nightlight inside the toilet.  BioBidet is on the side, but I still like that too.\n4.  Powerful enough... Even though the biobidet has the strongest water pressure, I rarely use it's highest setting.  This device's highest pressure setting is about the level 3 or 4 (out of 5) of the BioBidet... but plenty to clean up.\n\nNow, I received a broken unit (nozzle was detached).  Customer service from bidetking was exceptional.  They sent me a part and I took the option to repair my own device.  They responded with a PDF, photos with instructions, and replied back exceptionally fast.  All is well now.\n\nGood product for a mid-range... probably the best for it's price-range.\n\nPay attention to measurements.

Alpha's installation looked daunting at first, but it was a relatively easy setup and after getting everything situated, I used it.  I've used bidets in japan before, so it wasn't completely new, but having the warm water and the time to just relax makes me wish I had had one of these years ago.\nI will say I had an issue with a nozzle motor failure about 2 weeks ago, and at the time of writing this, their customer support has already identified the issue, and the part was replaced without issue, and the design of the hybrid's frame installation makes it so much easier to remove than I had even realized prior to needing to repair it.  At this point, I can safely say that if you're going for a hybrid this is the one to get feature wise, and if you like the peace of mind of competent and comprehensive customer support, they have it.  It's already paid for itself in terms of the previous cost of toilet paper.  10/10, would buy again.",

Not usually a problem except when we're in a rush in the morning.\n\nThe blow dry is inadequate to dry your rear in any reasonable amount of time. Takes several cycles to accomplish it, unless you use toilet paper to sop up most of the water first. This was the one disappointment.\n\nThe light is convenient when I need to piss at night, but is generally much too bright, I need to keep the bathroom door closed in order to get any sleep.\n\nThe seat cover is JUST a cover, much too flimsy to risk sitting on. Strange place to go cheap.\n\nOver all I love it, I'm kicking myself for not getting a bidet years ago. Will be getting another for the main bath, so our 12 year old stops using the master bath.",

While I enjoy the remote control, I'm starting to wish this could have the ability to customize what controls I use most, and can be accessed on the side of the bidet.\nThe first thing I noticed when trying this for the first time was the gentle water pressure. I had upgraded from the Luxe Bidet Neo 320, and while it was very limited on the features, it provided extraordinary range of water pressure. This bidet provides 2 settings, which is disappointing in this price range. I would like to see a higher water pressure threshold similar to the Luxe I previously had.\nThe gentle self-closing lid and seat are a very nice add-on, one that I've come to appreciate and wish I had in my other bathrooms. The built-in lighting can be most helpful for those late night or early morning visits.\nI find the self-cleaning nozzle to be stubborn, but it may have its reasons.After the nozzle has finished cleaning itself (in all of about 10 seconds), the stainless steel wand will remain outside of its housing to dry. You will have to initiate the cleaning a second time to send the wand back into its housing after another round of cleaning.\nThe product advertises unlimited heated water, but if you leave the spray on for an extended time (maybe 30 seconds or so), the spray wand will cease cleaning and will retreat back to its housing even when it was not commanded. I don't consider this a feature, I consider this an inconvenience. The Luxe stopped cleaning when I turned the device off.\nI'd like to see this change in Alpha's next version.\nOverall I am pleased with it, and award 4 stars to Alpha for its attempt at providing a decent bidet for this price range.",

Of course my warranty expired at 2 years which was just before my call.\nWhen it did work in the 2nd home I never knew if I would get hot or cold water, which, is no fun.\nMy brother has 3 of these in his home and the water temp is glitchy.\nI love having a bidet when it works hence the 3 stars.",

Thanks*\n\nI'd been searching all over the place for a bidet for quite a good while. I wanted most if not all the benefits of one of the top of the line bidets without the price that would certainly break my bank. Luckily I found this beauty on sale. The seat warmer alone was a game changer in the bathroom department. It has saved me from having to purchase as much toilet paper, in fact since I've gotten this bidet I'm still using the same paper from when I installed the device. Installation was a breeze except for the fact I didn't have an outlet close enough to plug it in but ordered an extension cord and it worked beautifully once it was powered up. The pressure and temperature adjustments are so varied that I'm sure anyone can find a level they like that's comfortable for them while it also has a child mode for those more sensitive skins. In fact this is now a staple in my home.\n\nMy only issue is the light isn't that bright. Sure you can see it, kind of, from a distance but it barely lights up the toilet. So if the light is a big part of wanting this bidet then I suggest looking elsewhere but if you want a solid bidet with all the bells and whistles that will leave you feeling cleaner then I highly recommend this product. Your backside will thank you tremendously.",

I have used several bidet seats and this is the 1st one that I have used that has this feature.  Because the seat is lifted so much, not having this feature is a real problem.  My toilet bowel is round and the unit takes up some of the space at the back of the seat so it effectively requires one to sit further forward than on a regular toilet set.  If you are planning a new toilet and have the space get an oval bowel for room for the bidet seat.  I have only purchase one whole bidet toilet.  The one I got has a considerably smaller drain hole and is very low flow causing constant clogs.  For this reason I seriously doubt I will do that again.

At first we were attracted to the great set of features and the low price point, but after a few months both units developed issues.  One unit developed a crack in the toilet seat (though it remained functional for the time being), and the other had stopped working altogether (when button is pressed, no water would come out but instead would just make loud thumping noises).\n\nWe sent the completely broken one back for warranty repair, and while the unit was technically restored to a functional state after (to be fair) a relatively painless process, cosmetically it looked like hell.  We took good care of the unit and tried to keep it fairly clean for the few months we've owned it, and in the span of two weeks at the factory it came back covered in scratched marks, scuffs, dust, and some kind of sticky gunk.  It was clear that no care was taken at the repair facility, and the unit was processed with the goal of bringing it to a functional state with minimal effort.  At this point, we will likely not return the other unit since the damage it would incurred at the facility would likely be worse than the crack it had developed.\n\nOn the company's warranty site, it's stated that there would be a cleaning fee if a unit was sent to them in an unsanitary state.  While that sounds reasonable, I do find it highly hypocritical for them to return the unit to us in a much worser state than when it left our house, even if only cosmetically.  I would not do business again with this company in the future, and I could not in good conscience recommend this product to any of our family and friends.",

                "review_body": "I love the sprayer functions, the easy to use controls, and the heated seat and air dryer. However, the seat plastic is way too thin and cracked early on, right at the back if the seat where it is thinnest.  I repaired it with a high-quality ABS adhesive, but new cracks appear every month. The soft close function on the lid  has now failed twice, due largely to the poor quality ABS plastic itself. The design if the cartridge socket is also a contributing factor. It uses a web design, however the webs are too thin and don\u2019t have enough strength or resilience to handle the repetitive force exerted over and over again by the closer cartridge.  Over a short period if time, the plastic work-hardens and becomes brittle, then crumbles like a cookie.\n  The original lid, and the replacement lid sent by the manufacturer,  both failed  at the 1 year mark. I\u2018ve spoken to others who had the same thing happen at or before 1 year of use.\nThe crack at the rear if the seat extended halfway across the top rear section where the seat us thinnest (way too thin).  The crack on the underside of the seat, near the bumper extended the entire width of the underside. Had I not noticed it, I suspect that the next time I sat on it, I\u2019d have ended up with my bum in the toilet and my feet in the air. Not a pleasant thought.  Of course, all if this occurred just barely outside the warranty period. However, this seems to be a common occurrence so i feel they need to address this problem.\n  My wife and I are the only users and we are both of average, healthy weight and treat the seat very carefully.  I have a background in composites and plastics so I have a clear understanding what cleaning products can and can\u2019t be used with ABS plastics. Therefore, neither excessive weight, nor chemical reactions can be blamed for the product failure. Neither can it be blamed on abuse from children since our children are neither abusive nor present in the home. Ours are All grown and fledged, and were never even very rambunctious when they lived here as children.\n  I\u2019m so disappointed because love everything else about this bidet seat. The sprayer works great and i like the fact that the remote can be mounted up on the wall rather than mounted on the side of the of the seat.  The heated water and heated seat are wonderful features, too. But the plastic quality issues have ruined the experience so much so that when I replace this seat (soon), I\u2019ll probably go with a different brand. Bummer.",

                "review_body": "The Good, Water pressure is fantastic high cleans very well needing only (1) cleaning cycle my prior bidet required (3) 60  second  cleaning cycles to do the job not sure why I saw some reviews saying the pressure was not good. I am only providing a water line pressure of 40lbs from a well and  it cleans perfectly actually need to adjust the pressure down on the remote.  The manufacture states the supply should be 50 to 60 lbs of water line pressure on high that would probably sting. The economy feature works well as it does not effect the hot water.  The heated water is better than other bidets I have owned you will only have a slight dip in temp after the tank has ran out. Note I am critical when it comes to heated to water and pressure these are musts haves for me. All other functions are quite good except for 2 features I  will  give my opinion on based on prior bidet ownership. Now here is why this bidet is not 5 stars.  The Bad, The first is minor the night light is worthless and does not  provide a usable light  unless the  lid is open.  You should never leave the lid open especially if you are using the heated seat option. If you are looking for a lighted function do not buy this bidet there are better ones on the market or you can just plug in a  small led night light that will cost you a dollar. This can be fixed by replacing the blue LED with a white 6000k one.  The Ugly, The biggest flaw with this product is the heated air dryer. If this is your first bidet so you understand no bidet dries you like a  hand drier you would find in a rest room.  The best driers require you to make a wipe and then sit for a minute or two.  The drier temp is there but the blown air is directed down away from your bum rather than directly at the spot you need to dry.  It basically blows a couple of inches below your skin rather than directly at it.  If you are looking for a good fan dry this one is not for you there are better ones made.  I think there is a way for  them to easily improve the direction of the air flow and have contacted support to see if they are interested in the  idea.",

                "review_body": "I have used the standard toilet seat for 38 years. Some plastic, some wood, some porcelain\u2026 then I discover this. I laughed when my friend shouted \u201cthe remote is on the wall\u201d as I dashed to his bathroom after a night of drinking and tacos. I enter his lavatory to see what I viewed at the time as a confounded contraption sitting atop his toilet. However, there was no turning back. As I sat down, the flow immediately started. Just as you would expect beer and tacos to effect a man. As I recover from the first wave, I remember his remote comment. I find it. Now let me regress to say that it was January. It was cold. The seat was cold. What do I see on the remote? A \u201cseat temp\u201d button. I press it and immediately feel warmth spreading evenly across my gluteus maximus.\n\nI then realize that Yucateca hot sauce on the already spicy tacos was creating its own heat right around my poor little dirt star. I see \u201cwater temp\u201d and \u201crear\u201d buttons. I press them. My singed and sweltering poop chute was immediately cooled by a stream of perfectly temperate water. I\u2019m impressed to say the least.\nAs I\u2019m feeling more relieved, I realize that in my haste to avoid a quite unfortunate and embarrassing incident that would\u2019ve surely ruined not only my night, but also my pants, I forgot to turn on the light. However, I see a blue glow coming from inside the toilet. I think \u201cmy god, it\u2019s radioactive\u2026 this is how it ends\u201d. I soon realize that this previously judged toilet seat emote a cool blue glow from within.\n\nI\u2019m feeling quite relieved and ready for round 2. I reach for the toilet paper. Damn. None.\n\nI then see \u201cdry\u201d on the remote. I press it. My soaked bum is not being caressed by warm air and is steadily drying off.\n\nNow, I wasn\u2019t fully sold, so I did a strange pants-down waddle to the sink and got a tissue just to make sure. I sit back down and find that this toilet seat has cleaned me thoroughly. I was cleaner than a politicians forged documents.\n\nI arise to realize that I am poor. Destitute. Poverty stricken. To have lived so long without this miracle of a product is shameful. I vowed that I would purchase one.\n\nToday, I did. I installed it (super easy. A slow monkey could do it), and immediately headed to the Thai restaurant for some paad thai with extra chili oil to really give this bad boy a run for its money. I let nature take its course and in just a few hours, the rumbling starts. I hurry to my throne and press the seat heater before I take my seat.\n\nI absolutely abused my toilet. This thing was like a hot spring at a sewage plant, but was no match for this toilet seat.\n\nI no longer poop like a poor. I am clean. I am satisfied. This is the best $250 I\u2019ve ever spent.\n\nBuy this and thank me later.",

                "review_body": "After living elsewhere with a bidet, life seemed uncivilized when going back to smearing my excrement around on my skin with pieces of paper.  I went looking for an inexpensive and low energy bidet that you can install just about anywhere that you can get power to.  This is a good one.\n\nThis bidet has a key feature I've been looking for -- it has the basic controls (wash rear, wash front, stop) directly on the body of the bidet behind the seat.  (It also comes with a wireless remote-control for fancier settings, but once I got them set, I toss the remote in a corner and don't bother with it.)  My earlier bidets had a whole arm attached to the left or right side, containing the controls, but that takes up space and doesn't work in a tight bathroom.\n\nThe three switches beside the seat are poorly labeled and poorly laid out, but they are there, which is the key.  By dropping your hand down beside the seat you can feel the controls, but you can't see the labels because the labels face rightward rather than upward.  I used a labelmaker to add a simple label on top.  They are poorly laid out because you'd expect that to wash your rear, you'd hit the button closest to the rear; to wash your front, you'd use the button closest to the front, and the button in the middle would stop things.  But it isn't laid out that way; the stop button is in front, the wash-rear button is in the middle, and the wash-front button is in the rear.  Somebody wasn't thinking too hard.  Indeed, the instruction sheets pretty much ignore these buttons on the body of the bidet, as if they were an afterthought, spending all their time on the fifteen switches on the remote control.\n\nI measured the power consumption of this bidet and when it's in energy-saver mode, it's super low power, less than a watt on standby, even with the LED nightlight on full time.  When you press a button to squirt, it can draw up to about 6 amps (900 watts) in instantly heating the water, but that only happens for a few seconds as you use it, and then you're done and it's back to <1 watt.  Many heated bidets keep a large reservoir of water permanently hot, burning power all day and night -- this one doesn't.\n\nIt makes a few odd noises when it's running, but I can handle that.",

                "review_body": "I wanted a Japanese style toilet seat, but it needed to be simple to use. TLDR: This unit was affordable, looks good, and was easy to install on an elongated toilet bowl. It has worked flawlessly but cleaning and drying power are limited, which is true for all such seats. Overall, I'm well pleased.\n\nInstallation: Total install time was about 1 1/2 hours including plumbing hook up. All needed parts were included. There's a plastic locking tray that's attached to the bowl and the seat slides on and clicks into place. The large arrow embossed on the tray should point to the toilet tank, which is not shown in the instructions.\n\nElectrical: I strongly recommend a GFI (ground fault interrupt) grounded 3 prong outlet within a few feet of the toilet for electrical power. You can easily replace a standard 3 prong outlet with a GFI outlet. If there's no outlet, you'll need to install one. I had to do that and it cost about $150 in parts and took me about 10 hours (cutting into drywall, running Romex cable, connecting to the existing 15 amp line in the bathroom, and installing a GFI outlet. An electrician can do the job much faster and better, but it will cost more. Mixing water and electricity can be a real safety hazard, so don't try to get by with an extension cord.\n\nRemote Control: The remote control is big and the buttons are easy to read and understand. The seat worked perfectly as soon as it was plugged in. Water pressure and temperature, nozzle position, oscillation and pulsing water are all controlled by the remote. However, the duration of the wash cycle is fixed and seems fairly brief. Of course, you can simply re-run the wash cycle for 2x cleaning. You can also use the remote to adjust the temperature of the seat and the drying air.\n\nImpression: The seat is streamlined and looks good. Slow close seat and lid prevents loud noise, but don't try to force them to close quickly. Don't sit on it with the cover down, it's not designed to carry the weight. Build quality seems good. I've used similar units when travelling in Japan and performance is comparable.\n\nIt's unrealistic to expect this seat to replace toilet paper and need to wipe (which is true for all comparable seats I have used). You'd need to install a pressure washer and rotating brushes like a car wash to actually scrub your rear clean. Similarly, you'd need a high powered blower and 1000 watt heater to actually dry off the water.  You'll still use toilet paper, just less than before, and you'll feel cleaner.",

One can buy new buttons, too, but putting them in is next to impossible -- maybe it takes a special tool -- so once the buttons break, they are toast.

These are padded enough to protect, but also thin and light. and i can slide laterally all day and they don't slip out of place. One thing though, use only the bottom strap. take the top one off and save it as a backup. Both straps together makes the pants bunch up behind the knee and is VERY uncomfortable. one strap solves that problem. BEST pads on the market!",

They can only be worn over long pants (quite painful on bare skin). The rubber straps dig into my skin and are generally uncomfortable (even on top of jeans). Maybe it's because I have skinny legs, but the straps also tend to pop off the attachment studs easily.  Due to the hard plastic design, the knee pads do not flex very much (also adding to the poor wearability).",

I liked that they had two straps since the pads with single straps in the crease of the knee cannot be comfortable.  However, both of the straps end up in the crease of the knee which is uncomfortable.  Also, for walking around from one place to another as while gardening, my knees knocked together, creating almost a tripping risk, and the pads rode down sort of pulling on the top of my kneecaps when I walked which was uncomfortable.  Due to the bulkiness of them, they were a risk going up and down ladders since they caught on each other.  If you have normal-ish knees that are not suffering from joint/cartilage/arthritis damage, they might work better.  I had higher hopes.  For some tasks where you are strictly on your knees and not moving around much, they might work well to just leave them unbuckled under your knees for cushion.",

After years of every other day usage I\u2019ve had 2 straps rip and strap buttons break off. Seems there is no way of repair. I\u2019m a big man so that might factor into durability. I recommend as a solid, decent comfort, knee pad for the $$$\u2019s. 4 stars leaves room for improvement as mentioned. Edit 5-31-22, I was mistaken for suggesting there isn\u2019t a way to repair a broken strap button. The buttons are available for repairs. It\u2019s not easy to push the new button through the existing hole but there is a Utube vid which explains the procedure. My new rating is 4.5 stars. leave\u2019s room for more improvement.",

                "review_body": "As a wood flooring contractor, I have tried many types of kneepads and these are the only ones I have found that that provide the best all around characteristics of a work knee pad for fit, feel and function.  BUT.....\n\nFirst, I do cut off the top part of the pad's shell so that I only have one strap behind my knee.  Every guy that has worked for me and tried using two straps complains that there is too much strap and pants bunched up behind the knee.\n\nWhat I do; starting just under the the top strap's securing knob and run the cut above and along the third ridge from one top knob to another.  This makes the knee pad lighter and leaving for one strap.  I work all day in them like this and find this is the best I can find in Knee pad design and it's practical usage. Or, just don't use the top strap.  It feels odd at first but you quickly find this is the best way to wear them, using only the lower strap.\n\nHome Depot and Lowes just switched from carrying  the CLC to one that looks very similar.  It is close but I won't buy those types again because they have some negative characteristics.  Therefore, I came to Amazon to find The CLC pads and bought several to stock up.\n\nI don't like the gel CLC knee pads for my work because there is too much padding inside and with all the moving around my knee tends to slide off the cushion too easily.  The gel ones are better for more stationary applications\n\nNot A 5 star because the top strap is a negative in usage and most people think you have to use it.",

These are the most comfortable kneepads I've found; and I no longer shop for better brands. When a pair of these wears out, I buy another pair. However, I've found I can make these last pretty much indefinitely buy buying replacement buttons. Before I knew you could repair the plastic buttons, I was going through a pair of these every six months. Now, I buy a couple packs of buttons, and whenever an old button tears off, I install a new one and keep the kneepads going for another six months.\n\nI keep a spare pair of kneepads for convenience. It's not always possible to fix a broken button while I'm on the job. I does take a bit of effort; and it's hard do do unless you've got a heat gun or hair dryer (to soften the rubberized button holes) and pair of needle nose pliers to pinch the buttons through the holes. But once you get the hang of it, its' easy.\n\nI'm a big fan of these! Five stars, plus!",

Of all the sinks I have had in my kitchens over the years, this one is by far the best. I don't say that lightly, for it was competing with a hand-hammered copper farm sink with a live finish that I adored. The Delta Lorelai's undermount fits with the design of my current kitchen and, unlike the Kraus sink in a previous renovation, drains well. To boot, the Delta Lorelai smooths out the corners to make the sink exceptionally easy to clean. So, while I loved the look of the copper sink, I love the functionality and look of the Delta Lorelai with its handy accessories.",

You might be surprised how many shower chairs have problems with this.  Many are not very deep and it feels like I'm going to fall off or tip it whenever I move around.  I've had a couple which have had a significant depression for your backside that I assume makes some feel safer, but all that does is make it harder to get what I need to get done.\nI've also had shower chairs which had smaller backs (boo) and which have had plastic legs.  The plastic leg model FELT more stable but I broke two of them in a pretty short amount of time.  The metal legs feel a little wobblier, but I promise you they are solid!\nThe chair is also adjustable height, which is obviously important if you want it taller or shorter.  I have mine basically level to the height of my wheelchair seat, so that makes transfer very easy.\nOverall, after many shower chairs, this is my favorite, hence the 5-star review.",

The seat and back looked large and comfortable; the whole thing was light weight.  Just what I wanted.  Very few parts and straightforward instructions.  There are five machine screws that attach the legs to the underside of the seat.  The heads of these screws are embedded in easy-grip knobs (genius) that you turn by hand to tighten for tool-free assembly.  Four of the screws started and spun easily to partially secure the legs.  The fifth screw was a little scratchy at first, but finally smoothed out.  Then I went back and started to tighten them all down to finish the job.  The fifth screw went in about three more turns and then just spun in place.  It would not screw in or screw out.  In order to get the thing to fit back in the shipping box, I had to get that screw out of the leg assembly.  The nut that was embedded in the seat popped out easier than I'd like to admit.  The whole thing is in the mail to be returned as I type this.  UPDATE:  I can highly recommend the Moen DN8060 Home Care Shower Chair, Glacier.  The 8060 model needs a phillips head screw driver for assembly.  There are no plastic knobs to turn (and possibly allow the screw head to slip inside).  I ordered the 8060 to replace this chair and am VERY happy with it!",

The height is perfect for taller individuals like myself, offering a comfortable seating experience. The only improvement I would suggest is a wider seat, as it can feel a bit snug for those who prefer a little more space. Overall, this toilet has been a fantastic addition to my bathroom and I highly recommend it to anyone in need of a reliable and efficient toilet.",

From my research, I thought the flushing twice business was a thing of the past with these new, improved low flo toilets. And the flushing twice sort of does away with the water efficiency. I'm not sure what the EverClean surface is all about.  I have to wipe down the sides more than any other toilet I've had. So, it looks pretty and has a fairly quiet flush, but don't expect the flush to wow you.  And that is what it's all about.",

WOW! this toilet does everything it says it can do except clean itself! It's quiet, it flushes a LOT of matter (you know what I'm referring to) and is very easy to clean. Some people have had problems with the cover, which was a concern for me after reading the reviews. However, my husband and I aren't small sized people and as long as you sit gently down (Not come crashing down with all your body weight at once, which most covers probably couldn't take anyway) we've had NO issues. I have a 4y.o. son so I love that the seat and the cover are slow closing. No way to get anything caught by dropping the seat or cover when closing. We bought two to replace the horrible all-in-one system toilets we had. So now after a year, the toilet(s) still work great! We've also saved about $30 a month on our water bill which means these toilets will have paid for themselves in a few years. Excellent toilet! We reccommend highly.",

I did an online return and Amazon was so quick they sent the return label through UPS and UPS picked up the returned item the next day. In five days I got the replacement. Installed it and am very happy. It uses so little water and flushes with such ease that it is indeed a great replacement for my 50 year old toilet which takes 3.4 gallons of water to flush as opposed to 1.3 gallons for the new one. So much for water savings. This particular model comes with a slow closing seat cover (not all models come with it, so watch out for the correct no. product) and it's great. Overall my experience with Amazon on replacement and the product with its functionality are both exuberant. I am thinking American standard products are made in America and it is one reason I chose this product. No reservation in recommending to one and all.\n\nJAYARAMAN, Memphis, TN",

                "review_body": "I bought this toilet primarily for its one piece design (go from 4 potential leak sites to one).  Not sure if they changed the design from the reviews stating imperfections in the flapper valve seat causing leaks but both toilets I purchased have plastic flapper valve seats that screw in and work perfectly.  Used a Fernco, FTS-3, 3inch wax free toilet seal which makes the instal very easy, simply had someone spot the bottom and dropped it in place.  I also have a Fernco, FTS-3 on my Toto and lifted that toilet after about 4 years to refinish the floor and the seal was perfect. The directions call for caulking the bottom of the toilet to the floor.  I can see this to keep water from going under the toilet (spills, washing the floor etc.) but this will also hide a seal failure.  I calked everything but the very rear of the toilet for the aforementioned reason. You have to hold the handle down for a full flush, which I don't view as a problem.  It is better than the Toto for bowl cleaning and clogging (no clogs so far) and the Toto sets a fairly high bar.  It is a heavy toilet so if installing it yourself I would have someone present to line it up when you place it on the flange bolts.",

Delivery shocked the truck drivers ( they didn't know what it was until we opened it for inspection) and packaging for protection was flawless. Installation was a breeze although I fail to understand why they don't provide a wax ring, cant be the cost as they are inexpensive, however its adds another trip to the hardware store before you can install. Although I installed it  without help, I would recommend an assistant as this toilet is heavy. I believe the Cadet 3 will save on water but time and the next water bill will be the proof. Now for why I didn't give it 5 stars. The self closing lid is nice when it works and it does not work all the time without assistance. Second, if you had a big dinner the night before, it sometimes requires a second flushing. In summary, I like the Cadet 3 and would probably buy another if the sale price is low enough but I am now waiting on the one piece Champion 4 right height, price to come down as it is quite a bit more expensive but appears to be better than the Cadet 3.",

At first glance we thought we had a perfect model we could standardize on.\n\nSadly these units do have a problem. Specifically they leak, new from the box.  It's not a huge leak but over the course of a few hours the tank level will drop by about an inch and the fill valve kicks in. They are using a Fluidmaster assembly and we believe the problem is with that specific component as the china toilet itself 'appears' to be fine.\n\nAmerican Standard denied there is a problem, yet we have three identical units all purchased since November 2019 and each one leaks the same way.\n\nWe are currently troubleshooting and are going to replace the OEM Flapper with a Fluidmaster 5403 at our own expense.  We shouldn't have to do this but the manufacturer isn't helping.  If this doesn't work then we will have to look at the interface where the flush assembly meets the china toilet itself.\n\nWhen we arrive at a confirmed solution, I will come back here and share it with you hoping to save you the headaches we are enduring.",

                "review_body": "I tend to discount reviews that complain about a defective product; I know that every manufacturer will occasionally slip in a klunker. I also know that I'll return defective merchandise -- so I focus on what reviewers say about non-defective items.\n\nSo, here I am writing a review about a toilet I received that was defective. I'm taking one star off for the defect because an installed toilet is quite a bit different than most items when you contemplate returning it. In this case I think the defect should've been caught by the manufacturer.\n\nHere's what it was: the toilet appeared to be in good shape when it arrived. I had it installed by a professional plumber. It had a slow drip from the tank into the bowl, causing the tank to partially refill every 4 minutes. I had the plumber come back, but he was unable to fix it (or thought he had).\n\nI contacted American Std: they diagnosed a faulty flush valve (the entire piece with the \"flapper\" on it) and shipped out a new one. I requested Fed-Ex (since this is the only toilet in our house), but they used USPS so it took 10 days.\n\nWhen I took off the old valve I discovered the real problem. There was a porcelain burr on the tank itself about 1/8\" high and about 1/4\" long. The valve was not sealing over that big of a lump. So I filed/sanded it down, installed the new valve (though the original one was probably fine), and it hasn't leaked since.\n\nThe tank appears to have been made in Mexico, while the valve was made in China. I assume that someone in America had to put the two together and should've realized it wasn't going to work with this defect on the tank right where the valve is supposed to seal. So Quality Control is a little suspect here.\n\nNevertheless, now that the defect has been removed, I really like this toilet. It uses an amazingly small amount of water (a sip rather than a big gulp), and the surface stays clean. I also like it being one piece: less to go wrong. I recommend it, and if yours has the same symptoms you'll now know where to look (unscrew the flush valve from the tank and look for imperfections on the tank itself).",

                "review_body": "We bought the AS 2403.128.021 (this model has a 1000 rating by established Federal \"flush standards\") to replace a 2-peice Gerber that, after three return visits from the plumber who installed it, replaced the Gerber, at my insistence, with the AS. The Gerber would neither flush thoroughly; nor stop a persistent, slow leak in the refill assembly. Despite protestations from the \"pro\", I purchased the described AS model, which was \"cast\" in Costa Rica, and assembled in the US. Excellent toilet. Meets ADA standards; fills quickly, quietly and completely; surprisingly clean and thorough flushes; one-peice design is sleek, modern, and easy to keep clean; the included @ $50 slow-close seat is functional and well-made, although of plastic; and, perhaps most worth-while, there is a significant reduction in water usage. We were so impressed with this AS Cadet unit that we purchased another for our guest bathroom. Although this second toilet was \"cast\" in Mexico, it has the same positive attributes as the Costa Rican model, except for the flush stand-pipe assembly. That required some rookie, time-consuming adjustments, but now works as well as the earlier purchase. More importantly for you, dear reader, I am a Harry Homeowner. I pulled - and replaced the 40 year-old AS 2 peice toilet by myself - NO PLUMBER! NO LEAKS! One wax ring - one new flexible water line connection. Flush away!",

New toilet styles keep using less and less water (not always a plus) but this flushes well and fast, with more of a big gulp sound in the beginning, then refills quickly.\n\nThe plus side to less water is the smaller tank. Even though this toilet seat is taller than my old one, it seems to take up much less space overall, which was an important factor when selecting this specific model. My powder room is very small, and this works beautifully.\n\nMany kudos to Amazon for outstanding delivery right inside the home. I was afraid to order a toilet online after seeing pics online from various stores of mishaps and broken pieces, but this was packaged exceptionally well.\n\nAt this time, I have no complaints, other than the seat seems a bit cheap, but the slow-close is a nice feature. I would not hesitate to purchase this toilet again.",

                "review_body": "2022 update at end\n\nNot really what I was expecting.  Maybe it's due to it's only a 1.28 gal toilet?\n\nFlushing action is different but underwhelming - it flushes from around the rim downward (the amount is not that great) & it also at the same time shoots a blast of water from the front of \"rectangular\" bowl 'pit' (not sure what to call this opening?) towards the back of the toilet, basically pushing the bowl content out as the downward water flow pushes down.\n\nThe design of this rectangular bottom of bowl pit design is to push to the back and then up and down the modified S-hump (longer running start...?) - versus the old circular bottom of bowl pit design of pushing down, then up the S-hump and then down.\nIt is just a different design. But, with this 1.28 gal toilet, you may have to flush twice, no way around it. It depends on what kind of food you've eaten and how the waste feces adheres to the bowl (sorry, trying to be delicate). But, with that Everclean glazing, the 2nd flush seems to always clean out everything.\n\nMaybe the 1.6 gal toilet has that more dynamic flushing action we've seen in the TV ads - more water?  But many buildings will only allow tenants, home owners (condos/coops) to install 1.28 gal toilets. Oh well, stuck with 1.28 until we get our own detached home or duplex....\nIt is still odd to watch this different flushing action, from the 2 points of water action.\n\nSo, due to the underwhelming flush action and the nice glazing, I've come to a 3 star rating.\n\nPros:\nvery quiet - while flushing and tank refilling (no gurgles or hissing or anything else - maybe from the other complaints I've read, it is due to how their units were installed?) - and I'm very noise adverse\nfast tank refill,\nEverclean glazing - definitely less cleaning,\nslow close toilet seat,\nsmall footprint,\nTHE HEIGHT (nice),\neasy install (but I had building folks do it)\n\nCons:\nslow close toilet seat - to me it is somewhat flimsy, I like the thicker seats better - going back to my previous seat which is great and giving this one to wifey (she likes it)\n\nAug 2022:\nThis toilet bowl does do the trick.  I just neglected to return and update it SOONER.  A neighbor was asking for some input and I told him about this model.\nI do like it. No real regrets in purchasing it.  It is a solid, efficient flush - RARELY need to flush twice to remove bowl contents.  RARELY.  VERY quiet, still to this day.  Did I mention I RARELY have to flush twice....\nThe height is more than nice, it is MUCH better than the shorter toilet bowls (i.e. Toto).\nGiving it 4.5 stars since I rarely give anything 5 out of 5 or 10 of 10 stars.\n--- would recommend this to everyone.",

It works better than any new or old toilet I've ever seen or tested, it is compact everywhere except the seat, it looks nice and it is incredibly inexpensive (compared with what most people are spending on new toilets).\n I needed to get a new toilet. I'd seen &used the new lower water use toilets at other peoples' home. They varied from not\nvery good (less water in the bowl, but you have to flush 5 times to clear it), to terrible (even endless flushing couldn't deal with the smears). I spent ages researching toilets. Learned you shouldn't buy any toilet that hadn't been summited for a MAP score. Then I poured over buyer reviews. This toilet clears a tremendous amount with one flush. And there is no smear problem at all. (I believe work was done on creating a surface finish to stop this happening, and making the shape of the bowl better too - whatever was done, it works 100%)Zero.\nIt's a one piece, but not that heavy. It's compact, but with an elongated bowl (i.e. better for larger people) and is higher than a normal seat (good for older people), but not massively so.  The compact size, and it's being one piece means it is very good where space is limited. It sticks out from the wall much less than a 2 piece would, or a non compact one piece. And the cistern is compact -narrow from side to side, and from top to bottom. But the main thing is: this is a water efficient toilet that really is efficient. No need for multiple flushes, and it keeps really clean.  I can't recommend it enough. Didn't know the US still had a co. that could innovate properly and make a really good modern product.\nLooks wise it's a pleasant blend of somewhat traditional in style with clean unobtrusive lines. (I learned to avoid the retro look toilets....most of them haven't even been submitted for MAP testing.)\nAgain..superb work on American Standard's part.",

There just has to be a better way to do it. The chain is also very short but it does work. I had hoped that installing it would be the end of my headaches with this toilet, but no. You\u2019ll see in the picture I included that there is a crevice where the chain gets stuck about every other time I flush the toilet. This is seriously annoying and totally defeats the purpose of having a new toilet flapper since I have to stick my hands in the water to free the chain every other time anyways.

Apparently, there are quite a few still in houses. Enough, for various aftermarket suppliers to make up repair kits. Okay, here's the info on ELJER TOUCH FLUSH. These toilets had some good points, but the linkgage was not the best. The aftermarket product is worse. This assy does not include the chrome PLASTIC handle. Even back then, ELJER used fake chrome. The clip that holds the handle is subject to repeat failure. There is a brittle connector link that goes from the handle to the chain that is pictured. Most kits have those part too. Plumcraft and Master Plumber are two complete kit vendors. Now, why did I buy this assy. Okay, the stopper ball is better quality as is the plastic in the attached arm. The chain is semi resistant to Chlorine. The cheaper kits contain metal chains that seem to disintergrate in tank water that contains a chlorine treatment tab. This metal chain seems resistant. I will get back in 3 months more and verify. Why chlorine affects a metal chain is a mystery to me. I do know from personal experience having two ELJERS that chlorine tabs result in the chain breaking into ten pieces after several months. The package for this kit says resistant to chloride.",

My supply elbow is 5/8\" and the threads don't even touch it.  So even if my rough-in were perfect, the maximum thread engagement is less than 1/4\"?? I emailed Hansgrohe customer support asking if there was an adapter of some sort and still have received no response a week later. Another negative, it requires you to drill 4 holes for a large bracket. So, once you've installed this you're committed.  No other arm will cover the holes.

Think long and hard whether you want to spend that extra money on a simple aesthetic difference. If you do, this is a handsome piece of plumbing made by Peerless, a plumbing fixture brand owned by the American building products conglomerate Masco. Masco also owns Delta, among other plumbing fixture companies, and Peerless shares some of the same design and build qualities of more expensive Delta fixtures--and, importantly, the same nearly bulletproof lifetime-of-original-owner warranty. Peerless is marketed as a homeowner-installable brand and thus comes with detailed helpful instructions.\n\nThis is a three-hole fixture, coming with separate hot and cold valves and ceramic cartridges. Your vanity top must have three holes for this faucet to work in it. The faucet itself is stationary and does not swivel. The brushed nickel finish is handsome--and Peerless finishes, while not of the stellar quality of hansgrohe (another Masco brand) will last many years.\n\nHonestly, if you like the appearance of this faucet, you will like your purchase. It will last a good long time, and if any part of it should break, Peerless's customer service will take good care of you.",

                "review_body": "Very nice looking faucet and if you've ever installed a faucet before you won't have any problem installing this one. Here are a couple Pro tips. If you're installing this faucet onto any natural stone countertop be sure to use Clear 100% silicone under the handles and spout, do NOT use plumbers putty because the oil from the putty will stain the stone and you will end up with dark rings around the handles and spout. Also, don't skip the silicone step or you will find water inside your cabinet. Last, here's where you do use plumbers putty. Your kit will come with a rubber washer to use on the underside of the sink bowl which is great but if you want to prevent leaks for a longer period of time add a little ring of plumbers putty between the drain and the sink bowl. I'm referring to the part of the drain that you will see from above, not below. You don't need much and when you tighten the drain a little putty should squeeze out, just use your finger and remove the excess. Between the silicone under the handles and spout and the plumbers putty between the drain and the sink bowl you should be nice and leak free for many years.\n\nIf this helped you at all, please do me a favor and click the Helpful button below.

Now it will not keep water from draining. I contacted the company to see if I could purchase just a replacement strainer basket but was told they only offer the full assembly. Crazy! The full assembly is anywhere from $65-$115 for the brushed nickel finish. That was an unexpected expense after I purchased my farm sink. Now I have to do it again a year later just to get my sink to hold water. Unsatisfactory. Can't believe company won't provide a better solution.",

Doesn't even have enough spray to wash the dirt down the drain after a shower. Would be nice for a one time spa shower experience but not adequate for a day-to-day shower.",

It\u2019s interesting for sure, almost atomized droplets but it makes the water far from the nozzle cold. To the point that when you get into the shower initially you have to brace yourself to get through the cold mist to the shower.\n\nWhen I use the wand the wand temperature is noticeably hotter than the overhead, so when I use to wash my littles when they shower with me I\u2019m cold and they are too hot.\n\nAdditionally, with the movement up and down the bottom was secured with a double sided adhesive. This wore out over the 3 months I\u2019ve been in the house and recently fell off and the whole assembly landed on my foot. When I mean assembly I mean the entire freaking shower came off the wall, not just the wand.\n\nThe wand magnet is way too weak and falls off regularly. So then the plastic shield falls off repeatedly.\n\nTruth be told I just replaced this overpriced and over engineered shower head for a less than $100 head and am much happier.\n\nMy wife didn\u2019t care about the adjustable height as much as the droplets that actually make it feel like a shower and not a mister that doesn\u2019t rinse.",

Everything snaps in nicely and the directions clear and easy to follow.\n\nThe shower is a variation on a rain shower--and so it shoots misty water droplets rather than a steady stream. When you stand under it it's quite nice and you feel encompassed by the warmth of the water.\n\nThat's the good part. Unfortunately I'm quite a bit taller than my wife, who is 5'4\" and by the time the water reached her it has significantly cooled off to the point that she had to turn the heat to max. That meant that when she used the wand (which is pretty feeble...) it was scalding. For both of us the shower just didn't really clean our lower-halves. It's great on your face and upper-body, but just doesn't have the rinse of a standard shower. It claims to be 45% more this or that, but it really isn't.\n\nThree stars though for a good idea, excellent engineering, and much ease in de-installing it. We wrote to customer service to return it and they promptly answered in a thorough and helpful way.\n\nGive it a try if you're really taken--maybe our shower pipe is situated too high or our water pressure isn't all that. But this didn't work out for us.",

The silver hoses are quite ugly, and don't match the black trim or the chrome components. Why wouldn't they also make the hoses black?\n\n3. The hoses are way too rigid. The handshower does not stay in position due to the rigidity of the attached hose. This is a major downgrade from the design of the original Nebia shower.\n\n4.

Seemed like what we were looking for, so we went ahead and purchased.\n\nAesthetics wise, it looks great. It looks really nice in the shower, and gives the shower a modern feel. This is the only positive comment I can give for this shower head.\n\nThis shower head has stoped spraying from four nozzles after only two months of use. This SHOULD NOT HAPPEN for a product over $300. Period.  We have cleaned it multiple times, and attempted to take it apart to see if there was an issue. Nothing. There is no build up, and we do not have hard water.\n\nDO NOT purchase this shower head!!",

                "review_body": "These fit regular and soft toilet seats, not just wood toilet seats.  They are perfect, much sturdier than the cheap plastic things. UPDATE: While I absolutely continue to recommend these screws over the cheaper plastic things that usually come with replacement toilet seats.  However, I need to add that these screws will loosen up over time just as the plastic ones do.  Periodically it's necessary to tighten them again or your seat becomes unstable and starts to rock and slide around.  I don't know what the solution is to prevent this problem, but I will say that in my experience, this is what has caused the plastic bolts/screws to sheer off and break in the past.  At least you don't have to worry about that happening with these tough metal ones.\n\nYou should keep in mind though, that with enough force you could still potentially break the seat if it's unstable, even rocking off center just a little bit, and even if the bolts remain intact.  You could crack the seat or--more likely, snap the hinges if it slides around repeatedly as the unexpected stress will fatigue the hinges where it's most vulnerable--especially if the hinges are plastic (and most are).  Let the problem get bad enough and they could potentially be the only thing supporting the seat as weight is applied. The hinges aren't designed for that kind of repeated stress or torque and someone could easily wind up taking a tumble to the floor in the most compromising state (potentially leading to a most embarrassing predicament).  Imagine breaking a hip because your toilet seat fell off. Imagine that call to 911---and while you are waiting for your rescuers, imagine how entertaining this will be to the hard-working medical personnel who will be treating you--\n\nNow imagine breaking a hip, being stuck on the floor and waiting for the medics when you had been in the bathroom in the first place--oh yeah! to relieve an urgent call of nature.... Even 15 minutes is going to seem like an eternity--and good luck keeping your modesty (let alone your dignity) intact if you can even manage to hold it long enough for anyone to help--if they are even willing to risk compromising your potentially broken hip......How do you spell relief?  U-R-I-N-A-T..... you get the idea.\n\nGood reasons to keep those bolts tight, eh?.  Good reason to make sure those bolts don't break?  I betcha though, that even in your worst case scenario, these bolts will outlast your toilet seat--maybe even your toilet.  These bolts are not going to break under ordinary use.  I doubt they'd break even if you left them wobbly and loose.  They are solid and heavy duty--easy to install and easy to tighten.  Well worth the nominal price.\n\nAnyone know how to prevent these bolts or screws from loosening up over time in the first place?",

On the plus side the stained finish is nice and the color difference between the two materials is minimal, but every time I look at it I will know.  I guess you get what you pay for since most solid wood seats are usually $75+.\nThe hinge was so sloppy (the seat slides side-to-side a good \u00bc\") that I ended up taking the hinge off my old cracked seat, polishing it up with some steel wool, and attached it to this one.\nIf you can afford it, spend the money for something better.",

Once the screws were secured we thought the problem was solved. Not! The plastic tube that fits inside the hinge and allows the seat or lid to move up and down is too short. This allows the hinge to come apart during any movement of the seated person. Hence the seat slides off to the side scaring the s--t out of the person. I know this what the person originally sat down for, but they didn't need to be scared to complete the task.",

This is just such a sleek look in the bathroom!\n\nWhile you could pay someone to do it... and yes I have ALOT of experience with tools and etc, if you or a friend have even the slightest bit of knowledge of tools, give it a whirl on youtube.

It does look larger than I expected, but that contributes to the dramatic look.\nThe parts that came with it were all well made.\n\nFinish truly shines.  The finish really makes the faucet stand out.\n\nIn evaluating a faucet, the installation should be discussed.\n\nI received this through Amazon Vine, but elected to pay for the installation through Amazon Services.  That was a new experience for me.  My countertop sink combo is cultured marble, and the shape of the underside working area made for a tedious and more difficult installation.  The working area was very tight with almost no legroom.  The directions could have been clearer.  I have installed faucets before, without any problems, but I didn't want to tackle this installation.\n\nAmazon will install items purchased elsewhere.  Installers may not be licensed professionals, but those are not needed for most installations.  I received word that an audio video firm would be installing mine.  A little surprising.  A 2 person team came out and did a fine job.  Perfect installation.  No damage.  By no damage, here's what I mean.  The previous faucet was installed 3 years ago by Lowes.  They sent out a handyman, who previously did some good jobs for us.  Plumbing was not his strong point.  On one faucet, he noticeably damaged the drain stopper rim.  On the other faucet, in the other bathroom, we had leaks.  He returned twice.  Tried his best. Couldn't fix the leaks.  We finally got a plumber.\n\nGiven Amazon's installation guarantee, and their care in selecting contractors, I am thankful that Amazon entered this arena.\n\nGreat faucet look.  Fine installation.",

                "review_body": "This is a modern appearing faucet that is more hefty than petite. Mine is chrome, and the finish is nicely applied and without blemish or scratch. The faucet handle works smoothly and is perfect for both right and left handed users. The faucet comes with all necessary hardware, Delta's usual complete instructions, and an escutcheon in case you need to cover the holes from cold and hot water faucet handles. Note that the escutcheon is just large enough if your previous handle openings were immediately next to the faucet opening. If the spread is more than that, the included escutcheon likely will not cover the space. Measure carefully if you're transitioning from a three hole to the single hole requirement. The flow restrictor can be removed, giving you a 1.3gpm flow rate. Several flow restrictors can be installed for anything from 0.5 to 1.2 gpm. I always figure that if I want a slower rate, I'll just close down the faucet a bit, but if I want to fill the sink, I don't want to have to wait longer than necessary. Note that there are a few places where things may eventually clog if you live in an area with frequent lime deposits from your water, including at the stream straightener just inside the outlet for the spout. I usually find for those areas, I prefer older faucet assemblies without a lot of washers, grates, and other potential clog spots. But this is a particularly attractive modern faucet that was easy to install and should give excellent long-lasting service.",

If you like the modern look, then this is worth checking out. The mechanism is smooth and and the \"eco\" stream of water is enough for most purposes. Heck there are even diamonds embedded in the valve for long-term durability.\n\nIt is larger than you might think from just looking at the pictures. Watch the video for better reference. If you have a traditionally styled bathroom, this not quite fit in, but my family likes it. I've installed a number of faucets and this Delta was one of the easier ones. If you have just a single hole in your countertop,  it provides a very clean look. The optional rectangular plate for sinks with 3 holes looks good too. That is what we used. Faucet installation was easy, but it took me a bit longer to swap out the old drain for the new one. No biggie - I know these projects are never without some hiccup. A professional plumber would likely have it in in no-time.\n\nIf you're on the market for a modern, efficient and durable bathroom fixture, be sure and consider the Zura if you have the budget.\n\n~ Kort",

I couldn't be happier. This sit a little higher off the sink which I like and enjoy. The finish is beautiful and it doesn't get all smudged from use, it looks beautiful with just a quick wipe. I really like the single handle, coming from a two knob system, very efficient when your hands are dirty you can easily use your arms or your wrist to turn it on! It is well worth the money!\n\nWe are a Delta house, we save up and invest in their quality so we only buy it once, my plumber recommends this company highly and he never has an issue installing Delta products in our house. Because it was installed by a pro, I am not able to tell you how easy it was to install, and if everything you need was in the box.",

                "review_body": "Overall, this is an excellent bathroom faucet. The installation took a little extra effort as my supply valve connections were 5/8\" and the faucet is plumbed for 3/8\". I took the opportunity to replace my supply valves with quarter turn cut-off valves of the appropriate size. Once that was done the installation instructions were fairly easy to follow (cold and hot hoses are clearly marked). I am very pleased with the look of the faucet, both angular and rounded at the same time. The single handle makes for a clean look and easy turn on / off.\n\nThe only negative I have for the faucet is the level of rigidity in the intake hoses. I mounted the faucet on a pedestal sink and it was next to impossible to position the intakes in a way that does not stick out to the side of the sink ( I eventually had to resort to a cable tie to keep things neat). This isn't a problem in a normal vanity mounted sink. P-)",

                "review_body": "We're remodeling our bathroom and replacing everything in it, even the tub and all the fixtures. First my husband did the tub with all Delta products. I have to say the Delta stuff is what makes the tub stand out as it's just a regular tub and nothing special. Ok, one Friday night my husband decides to remove the sink and vanity and since he has to work the next day he sends me to the hardware store to pick up another faucet set....he told me to get Delta. The woman there talked me into buying a cheaper brand and said all the inner parts were Delta anyway. By the time my husband got off work, the store was closed or else the cheaper brand would have been going back unopened. He put it on and fussed the whole time and told me that he didn't believe there were Delta parts in this one and he could assure me it would leak (before he even put it on!). Sure enough it leaked. He took it off and redid it again. It leaked again. Drip, drip, drip all night long and for two weeks now. I don't know which is harder to bear...the dripping or my husband saying he told me so.\n\nOk, I couldn't take it any longer and promised I would never buy anything except Delta brand again if he will just stop talking about it. My nerves are really frayed. I thought my problems were over when I got this faucet to review, but it's not the type for our bathroom, but it will fit in the sink downstairs, he said. I never said a word...I mean, this is awful fancy to go in a sink that only he sees!  It is really very nice and heavy and he installed it in just a few minutes (versus hours on the cheaper brand) and get this. No drips, no leaking. I have to admit that I felt like the drips and leaking from the other sink were the fault of well, the plumber (the husband)...and not from the faucet. I was wrong obviously and wish I hadn't rolled my eyes at him so many times while he was installing the imposter one. So none of the Delta faucets in the whole house are leaking or dripping, just the one imposter I brought home. Guess I will eat the cost of the loss and go get a Delta to replace it. I really wish my husband would let me go back in the store again, but he blames the sales clerk for talking me into getting a cheaper brand when I was specifically sent to get a Delta, so he says we wont' be going back there. I really don't know how I am supposed to explain all this to my uncle since he owns the store and really had nothing to do with it. Plus it's the only place around here that sells Porter Paint which is the only paint allowed in this house.",

                "review_body": "This is one heck of a beautiful faucet. For the do it yourselfers sometimes it is easier to take the sink top off, or take the sink out, do your install, and then place it back in again. That all depends on how your sink top, or sink is installed. Having to access the very back of a sink, and working around a sink that is hanging down in front of your work area dictates that a complete removal can be less work. Then you flip the top of the sink over onto a workhorse and do the faucet installation onto the sink top standing up. After that and you place the sink top back into position, all you have left are a couple of hookups and you are done. However some sinks are siliconed into place, or some sink tops have a lot of fasteners holding it down which means simply installing the faucet without removing it is less work.\n\nI have quality faucets throughout my home with one exception; the downstairs\u2019 bathroom. That was a cheapy faucet that had two separate handles. They say you get what you pay for and I now have a hot water side with a handle frozen, so that has to come apart in order to replace the internal valve. This Delta faucet has diamond seal technology featuring a valve embedded with diamonds to ensure like-new operation for the life of the faucet. Included in the box is an escutcheon to cover the holes in a 3 hole sink. Also included is a matching finish drain assembly.\n\nThe quality of the build from the faucet to the drain assembly is all top build quality. The chrome looks like it was dipped and then sanded and polished the way they do for the antique car shows. Just the design shape alone is a standout. The handle doesn't have anything flimsy about it. It's not hard to move but it is firm. It's not the least bit floppy so you can get the perfect setting on the first try. The firmness allows you to approach the setting without overshooting it.\n\nThis faucet is as much a contemporary statement as it is a functional tool. The nose on this extends out a little farther into the sink than my current Moen model does. The flow on this is a little better as well although it is still in keeping with the new modern water conservation standards.\n\nOne word of caution is that no matter how high grade this chrome is you DO NOT want to scrub it with a two sided sponge with a scotch brite pad on one side and softer sponge on the other. It is best to clean this with a soft cloth. You can use soap as long as it does not have abrasives in it. Nothing is more discouraging than to have a museum piece for a faucet only to scratch/scrub the surface and ruin the diamond gloss level to the shine. The scratch marks will show a mile away. I did that once before and it will never happen again.\nEven though the price tag is up there, so is the faucet. Buy it once and you will never have to replace it again. Highly recommended.",

                "review_body": "This faucet is beautiful in its simplicity.  It\u2019s quite tall, but the shape helps it to look less bulky than many of the other current (2019) Delta single handle faucet offerings.  The chrome finish is beautifully done, and it\u2019s sturdy.  It should be pretty easy to clean with a minimal number of edges to catch dirt and water.  It\u2019s very easy to install compared to most other faucets.  A couple of minor complaints:  1. It\u2019s pretty expensive compared to most of the other current Delta single handle offerings, but I\u2019m not sure the actual quality is that much greater.  I think you\u2019re mostly paying for the styling here. 2. The water stream is very powerful even though it is a water saving faucet, and that seems to cause a lot of water to splash out of the sink, at least for me.  3. The pop up control on the back of the faucet is pretty elegant looking, but it\u2019s just made of flimsy chrome colored plastic.  4. The drain pop up stopper is also just plastic, even though it\u2019s an \u201cMPU\u201d model which I assumed would mean the stopper would be metal.  5. Because I was replacing an existing 3-hole 4\u201d centerset faucet, I used the included base plate.  The plate looks nice and did a perfect job covering the outline of the old faucet, but it also is either just chrome color plastic or very thin metal (hard to tell) and not super sturdy to touch.  It anchors the faucet down solidly, though.  5. There is some rattling noise from the valve inside that seems to be common in other single handle Delta DST models when the handle is shut off quickly. It\u2019s almost a water hammer noise.  Overall it\u2019s a very nice looking faucet but I\u2019m not sure of the quality is any different than some other less expensive Deltas. This was a warranty replacement by Delta for another faucet that failed, and they are good about standing behind their products.",

My two issues are this-the aerator screen is hard mounted and if it gets clogged by debris you have to destroy it to remove it and replace with a new one, unlike other faucets where it can be screwed off, cleaned and replaced.  also the outlet arm is not what carries the water, it's a very small plastic tube running through it which connects to the aerator so the volume of water coming out of the spigot is greatly reduced.  from a water saving standpoint this is a good thing, but it might not be what you are used to.",

Very easy to install and came with everything you need for the installation except for the tools of course.\n\nThe only downside to our bathroom upgrade is that folks now spend much time in the bathroom than usual.\nOverall, its a great buy!",

The tub had an awkward shelf built onto the back to take up the three inches between the tub and the wall. We have gutted our bathroom and are reconfiguring it. The new walls are up, and waterproofing is painted on the walls and floor. We are replacing the tub with a custom walk-in shower. This liner is 6' x 7' (72\" x 84\") and our new shower is 34\" x 60\". After talking with the company that is installing the single-piece, created stone shower walls, we have decided to run the liner 8\" up the wall, for additional protection.\n\nSeveral years ago, we had a toilet flange go bad in a house and do hundreds of dollars in damage, I am choosing to put the extra liner under the toilet.\n\nIf you are doing a custom shower, you need this product. It has just enough stretch to it to make it easy to work with but not so much that you could potentially stretch it too tight and weaken it. When we are ready to add a bathroom to the attic space we plan to finish next year, I will definitely order more of this for that space.",

However, pretty much every warning you've heard about Kingston Brass faucets is likely true. Within two or three days after the professional installation of our faucet the screen in the actual faucet head started dripping. Within another day the water flow was quite limited. I called Kingston Brass, they said it sounded like the cartridges, which our plumber had already cautioned us about, and KB promised to send us new cartridges after we provided them with a copy of our Amazon invoice. If you contact KB be prepared to stay involved with the process utilizing multiple contact opportunities. While waiting for the cartridges to be delivered, my very frustrated housekeeper took matters into her own hands,  popped off the screen on the faucet head opening and found copious amounts of black gunk and apparent shavings clogging the screen. She removed the trash and further scrubbed out the faucet with a retired toothbrush and completely fixed the problem of low water flow. Our guess is the powder coating process on the oil rubbed bronze finish leaves quite a bit of interior residual trash. If you can afford a better faucet you probably should purchase it.",

This brand of fixtures rivals any other brand that you can buy on the shelf in big box hardware stores. Excellent Value with the Shopping ease of Amazon.\n\n1. A very simple faucet with nice detail & SN appearance.\n2. A great price point for the value. Comes with everything needed to install. I have a plumber hired and will not be doing this myself but it could easily be a DIY job.\n3. Mechanics work great and are very smooth.\n4.

                "review_body": "This AmazonBasics Modern Two Handle Goose Spout Basin Faucet, 4\", Satin Nickel, will never be mistaken for a high end faucet but it looks nice and is budget friendly.\n\nAt the current price of less than $44, it is comparable in price and quality to Glacier Bay brand found at Lowe's. I am not a faucet snob - there are times when budget hardware makes sense (or is a necessity) and this one functions well and looks attractive. We put it in a sink in the basement and I would expect to get maybe 10 years use from it since it isn't in a high use area.\n\nThis is for a 3 hole sink so make sure that's what you have. Installation was as easy as any other faucet installation, although we have installed a lot of faucets over the years. It can be accomplished by anyone who is reasonably handy with some basic plumbing tools although if you have old plumbing, you may well face issues like needing to replace rusty shut off valves, etc. If you have never installed a faucet before, I strongly suggest watching a few videos on YouTube to determine whether you want to try this yourself.\n\nThis faucet is made of a zinc alloy, although the spout is stainless steel so it doesn't have the heft of a brass fixture but it's reasonably weighty and solid feeling. The satin nickel finish is nice, especially for places with hard water as it doesn't show spots readily. The gooseneck spout is so convenient. It also includes a pop-up drain assembly (that is mostly plastic with a metal cap) and it functions properly so far.\n\nIf you are looking for a budget priced faucet and like the looks of this, you will likely be pleased with the quality.",

                "review_body": "Update:\n\nAfter a few weeks, I noticed what looked like water spots on the face of the faucet under the spout. Unfortunately, they are not water spots and cannot be removed. The first one we got doesn\u2019t have this problem. Unfortunately, we waited too long to return it. My advice: If you see this happening, return it pronto. These are not water spots but a defect which cannot be corrected and mar the appearance of the faucet.\n\nWe got this to replace a 25-yr old Delta faucet that was corroding away at the base.\n\nWhat I like:\n1. The price. This faucet costs about 1/4 what our old one did\n2. The materials: plastic and stainless, so no corrosion.\n3. The design: The spout is higher and hangs out about 2 inches further, making it easy to wash your arms. Compare pictures 2 and 3 which show where the water strikes the bowl.\n4. Installation: No plumbers putty needed for a leak-free installation. The gasket provided for the base seals it to the sink. And, the washer under the sink flange seals perfectly.\n\nWhat I Didn\u2019t Like:\n1. The white plastic bracket that holds the stopper pull rod wasn\u2019t straight. You can see this in the first picture.\n2. When I opened or closed the sink, my husband observed that it flexed. In contrast, the one from our old faucet was rigid and made out of aluminum. (We ended up reusing this piece from our old faucet).\n\nWe did have problems getting the sink plug mechanism to work smoothly. But, the causes were two: the angle of the existing hole in our counter didn\u2019t match that required for this faucet and, the bracket that held the pull rod wasn\u2019t straight and flexed excessively. We fixed the former by drilling out the hole in our countertop. We fixed the later by reusing the same part from our old faucet.\n\nBy the way, don\u2019t throw away the hex head (Allen) wrench. Although not mentioned in the manual or even listed as an included item, it\u2019s for removing the hot or cold knobs. Pull out the colored plug and you have access to the hex screw.\n\nBottom Line:\nI very much like this faucet. It is attractive, the mechanics work smoothly, it is made from materials that will not corrode, the long neck projects much further into the sink making washing your arms easy and it doesn\u2019t require the use of plumber\u2019s putty. I bought a second one for our other sink.",

I couldn't reuse the old one because the new one was about a quarter, maybe a half inch bigger so the old one kinda fell into the hole. I ordered this one and it fits perfectly. I only have two issues, which is why I took off one star. The drain holes are represented in the description as being large. While they may be larger than others, they aren't that large. If you are running water to wash your hands for example, the water tends to pool up for a bit and will drain off after you close the faucet. It's not bad, but it is noticeable. The second is the product description says it's heavy duty. No it's not. It's pretty thin stainless steel. But it looks nice. My mom complimented me on it. And it fits perfectly. It drains OK. It wasn't too expensive. Not too bad, all things considering.",

It will come out with a small pair of needle nose pliers, and you can always put it back in, if you think you a wasting too much water. After 6 months of use, my water bill has not gone up 1 penny. My water bill gets charged in 1000 gallon increments, 1000 being the minimum that you pay for, even if you only use 1 gallon. I have never gone over 1000 gallons, so I pay the same exact amount every month. If I want more pressure and flow, I am in control of that now, not some control monger politician, who has no business telling me how to use my water.\n\nIf you do remove the filters and flow controls from these units, you want to make sure that there are fine screen filters in both your hot and cold water lines just before your shower heads, otherwise you will eventually have clogged Body Sprayers that you probably won't get unclogged. If shower heads get  clogged from hard water, they can always be unclogged using CLR, but if fine chunks a debris, like small rocks, sand, and silt, get into your shower heads, they are toast. If you purchase the Danze Thermostatic Controller D155000BT it already has removable and easily cleanable fine filters on the supply side of the unit. You also want to be sure and use a minimum of 3 Body Sprayers on one circuit to distribute the total pressure across all 3 heads, otherwise the excess pressure can cause a separation between the front and back side of the body sprayer.\n\nI purchased all 3/4 inch high flow rate units for the Thermostatic Control and Volume Controls. I also intentionally chose to use 3 separate Volume controls, instead of a Diverter Valve, because I wanted to be able to turn on all of the shower heads and body sprayers at the same time. It's a little bit more plumbing work, but it was worth it. With this setup, when I turn on all 3 volume controls to maximum flow, I still get good pressure and flow from all 3 at the same time, and I get completely drenched with water from all sides. The pressure drops down to about 60% compared to the pressure when only one valve is open at full flow.\n\nThese little units look great and the massage function feels great at high pressure and flow.\n\nSo basically, I LOVE all of the Danze products that I have purchased, and I will more than likely never buy anything else. I am now a Danze fanatic and loyal customer.\n\n  All of the Danze Shower products are made with good quality brass, with good quality ceramic valves in the Volume control valves. I spent many months researching the best quality for the price, before I made my purchase. I found that nobody else came close to Danze for the price for their claims of good quality shower and bath components, but when I finally got these units in my hands and installed them and tested them for myself, it put a big huge smile on my face. They really are top quality, and the price is much better than than any other brands with the same quality.",

I was kind of disappointed when I opened it. At first, I was like \"wow\" but then as I unraveled the square trim piece, I frowned to find out it was shiny chromed plastic. Yes.....plastic.\n\nMy old one was the round basic - clean design but the general workhorse. I specifically did not want plastic because even though the old valve eventually leaked, the metal trim and handle was still solid. A little tarnished but solid. If anybody knows chromed plastic, you know eventually the chrome will flake off. So beware.....this has a metal base to attach to and a metal handle, BUT the square trim piece that has the hot/cold lettering and lever line is PLASTIC. I guess for now, I won't install it but I will see if I can find something metal everything in the meantime.",

                "review_body": "The spout and lever are heavy and appear to be durable and are aesthetically perfect.\nI cannot say if it's durable because the spout was only installed for 1 day.  After one use by the kids, the second day the spout would not divert to the shower.  I took the two torx screws out and could see the little orange, plastic diverter gate was broken.  It has two tiny little legs that are supposed to hold onto the metal lever.  One of the plastic legs was broken off so the lever would go up but the gate would stay down in the position that allows water to flow through the spout.\nI'll order a replacement and I wish I had more confidence that the next one will last longer.  This diverter will be used on a daily basis (or multiple times per day) as you have to use it every time you take a shower.\nVery disappointing design.  A 10 cent plastic piece ruins an otherwise nice metal (stainless colored but probably zinc) spout.\n\nPart 2, I sent it back and got a brand new one (Nice job Amazon).  I was eager to see if maybe the diverter was simply a freak manufacturing defect.  It was not.\nAdditionally, this faucet leaks internally.  When you pull the diverter lever, water gets past the internal plastic plumbing and runs back along the inside of the spout and exits through a little hole on the under side of the spout where it meets the tile wall.  The trouble is if the little hole gets plugged, then water will back up past the supply nipple and into the wall cavity where it will lead to rot.\n\nAlso, the diverter gate (see picture) is prone to breakage, if you try to pull it up while water is running, it gets stuck halfway.  Then half the water comes out of the shower head and the other half comes out of the spout.  If you (or your kids) try to pull it up to completely stop the partial flow from the spout and get more water pressure out of the shower, the little plastic legs will break off the diverter gate (see above)\n\nIf you fall in love with this spout, you need to be sure to\na) turn off the water before moving the diverter lever\nb) make sure the little drain hole stays clear\n\nif you or other users of the bathroom do not follow these tips, you will have trouble.  I sent the second one back.  Thinking more, I cannot rule out that the first one leaked.  It might have leaked too and I didn't notice.",

I can't speak to the function of the faucet because it's not yet installed (and probably won't be for a while; a one-man whole-home electrical, plumbing, and flooring re-do while also replacing some wall coverings and building all kitchen & bath cabinets/countertops isn't a quick process) but here's what prospective buyers should know:\n\nThe escutcheon, body, handles, and spray wand are plastic. The only exterior part that is metal is the spout. The faucet doesn't necessarily look like it's made of plastic but it definitely feels like it's plastic and it obviously weighs much less than an all-metal faucet does. Also, the product photos make the sprayer face/nozzles appear grey but it's black. On the underside of the sprayer, which isn't shown in the product photo, there is a black plastic button which I assume is a pause feature (the instructions are sparse) and a black plastic rocker which I assume changes the water flow from stream to spray.\n\nI'll be back to add to my review once this is installed, which will inevitably be way past the return window. The only reason I'm not returning this right now is because my wife insisted that the kitchen remodel include a two-handle pull-down faucet in brushed metal that isn't too sleek or industrial and this was the only design that she found that cost less than, like, $700.",

The design is great, and having the sprayer be one piece with the faucet instead of on the side is super convenient, especially if you only have three holes available in your sink. The body and the sprayer are well made and the finish holds well.\n\nHowever.\n\nThe faucet is made of plastic. That includes valves and handles. The valves are a bit on the tight side, and that makes the handles snap off at the thread where they are threaded into the vertical part.  I have gone through three sets of handles in two years of normal use.\n\nI have to credit the Belanger company for being nice enough to supply me with replacement handles under warranty, but this really should not have been necessary.\n\nHad this same faucet been made of sturdier materials, it would have been much better.",

Make sure your gutters and downspouts are very clean before installing (use a gas or battery-powered blower to clean out the gutters (you can buy a universal gutter attachment on Amazon for your blower so you can blow from the ground); run water from a hose down the downspouts). Then install the strainer. Periodically, go up on your roof and blow out the gutters, especially during summer and fall. Do it again after all the leaves have fallen for the year and before the first rain. I do this and clogged downspouts are a thing of the very distant past.",

If I don't use something to catch the leaves and flower petals then the tube gets blocked deep underground and 30 feet away from anywhere I can reach the plug.  I had to run a 50 foot drain cleaning auger and then a 100 foot water hose to clear out the plugs.\n\nI installed these gutter strainers and they trap the leaves and let the water flow over the top and down the drain.  A couple times a year I have to clean around the strainers but that is a lot easier than cleaning out hundreds of feet of buried pipe and trying to locate and remove the plug.\n\nThese have worked well for our home and it has made keeping the gutters clean and working a lot easier.  Just make sure that when you install the strainers that you collapse them and insert about an inch or more into the downspout to keep them in place.  Make sure that they open back up and provide a good fit in the downspout.  My downspouts had one screw going into them to hold them into place and I just made sure that the screw went into the mesh to hold the strainer into place.\n\nThese are not the solution to all of your gutter issues but for me they are the lesser of two evils and I would rather clean these than find a plug I can't see!",

These strainers don't eliminate gutter maintenance & cleaning, but they go a long way towards preventing stopped-up spouts. That's reason enough to have them.\n\nThe wire mesh construction is simple to squeeze into drain holes, then expands to fill the opening. The water and small debris (like sand, dirt, bugs, etc.) get through, but leaves, berries and other things don't.\n\nThe only thing missing from this product is the ability to buy a 10-pack.",

He had to twist it at the bottom to make it fit and pushed it down the gutter about an inch or so.  I have a tile roof. In Calif many of the gutter protectors don't work that is on the market because they are made to slide under the roofing whlch can be lifted up. Tile is nailed and can't be lifted. I saw one at ACE Hardware that AMAZON has that will work and is cheaper, however with this strainer I will not  need them.  Also I bought a gutter sprayer to clean out the dirt because we had winds up to 70 mph several months ago and I was told there was a lot of dirt and leave in the gutter which can be blown out this summer.  I want need the gutter protectors with this strainer and I only get leaves on one side of the house because of my neighbor trees and they can be blown out. I might get the gutter guards just for one side since they only run about $4 for about 20 feet. I just turned 71 in December and I had back surgery in 2006 so I have to rely on others to do the climbing so that is why I said I was told it was all I need by another reliable neighbor.  I buy a lot of things through AMAZON and I have always got good service.",

                "review_body": "This is a very simple solution to clogged downspouts, whether they are in a gutter or (as in my case) on a flat roof. The strainer is roughly six inches tall (two to four of which will be inserted into the downspout), and is slightly tapered so that the top is wider than the bottom.\n\nThe screen material is not welded together at the ends (you can see it in the picture above if you look at the back side). This allows you to \"roll up\" the strainer a little bit to make the bottom narrow enough to fit in the downspout's opening; when you let it go, it will expand on its own to hold it in place.\n\nNote that this will only fit in a circular opening, which is what many people have. This will not work if you have a rectangular opening, as it will leave a gap. Also note that you will still have to remove debris if it piles up around the strainer, as this will still cause water to back up, but at least you won't have a clog you'll have to roto-rooter.\n\nIf you don't have some kind of anti-debris covering on your gutters, or if you have a flat rook with a simple hole for drainage, this is a low-cost, low-maintenance option I recommend.",

That is precisely what I wanted, since cartridges and water saving bits of plastic all succumb to lime within a few years in my area. The fewer obstacles there are, the longer a faucet lasts.

I am used to replacing the rubber washers at the bottom of the splined shaft when they wear out & the faucets begin to drip, and occasionally one has to replace the valve seat in a faucet too. This one, though, does not seem to have a removable valve seat, so when it begins to drip you have to replace the whole unit.\n\nThe up side for me is that this shape actually does fit into the holes in my odd-shaped two-faucet 1915 porcelain corner sink, and it matches the HW faucet. Two buttons (H & C) are included so that the faucet can be used for either the hot or cold side.\n\nIn my experience, this model of faucet lasts around 5 years before they have to be replaced. Not long enough for something that costs $25, but I have not been able to find anything else that fits the sink.",

This one seems to fit well on our sink. I love how minimal it is, and don't expect to have the same issue with drainage. I just got it, so I can't say how it will hold up, but so far I'm happy.",

                "review_body": "I am very happy with this water purifier system.  I am not a fan of tap water because I can taste the metals and impurities in it.  This little device does the trick!  It eliminates  that taste altogether.  It tastes like bottled spring water to me. I like the look of the device too. It isn't too bulky and it doesn't get in the way when I'm washing larger dishes.  It has 2 settings on it which are very easy to switch on and off.  One setting is for washing dishes and the second setting is for purified drinking water.  It is very convenient to use.  The installation of this device was pretty simple but to be fair I am moderately mechanically inclined.  I  was able to install it without too much trouble.  DO read the instruction pamphlet before diving in to the installation part. It comes with several faucet pieces for you to use depending on the type and size of faucet head that you have.  You will NOT need all of the parts.  One of the the pictures posted in this review show the parts that I DID NOT use.  I still kept the pieces though incase I ever change out my kitchen faucet to a different type.  There are 3 different types of faucet heads that this device will fit.  Determine which type you that have in your kitchen and then read the installation instructions for that particular type.  This is why it is best to read the pamphlet beforehand or you may find yourself feeling unnecessarily overwhelmed.  It doesn't look like it is compatible with a pull down faucet head/ all in one sprayer.  I would double check this piece of information  before purchasing IF you have that type of kitchen faucet.  Also, do not throw away the little turning tool that it comes with or the piece of sandpaper.  The tool is helpful for the installation and the sand paper is used for the occasional cleaning/maintenance of the device.  Another thing to keep in mind is that you can use this water filtration system on your outdoor faucet spigot!  This would come in handy for easily filling up your dogs/cats water bowls when they are outside and providing them with purified water.  I love this versatile option because I have pets.  Last but never least, I noticed that the when the water filtration setting is on, the water tends to have a light back spray effect.  This happened when I was washing fruits and berries.  It wasn't much of an issue for me though.  I simply just turned the water down some and that did the trick.  There was no back spray at all when I turned the water filtration setting off to wash dishes.  I don't have a very deep sink though so perhaps that was the issue.  Note that the pamphlet says the filter will last you anywhere from 3 - 6 months depending on your water pressure and the quality of your city's water.  Yes you heard right!  The filters are replaceable AND they are easy to swap out!  It makes sense to me that I will be able to tell by the quality of my drinking water when I need to replace the filter.  I am going to purchase some extras filters to keep on hand.  Overall all, this water purifying system is efficient, economical AND affordable. I would purchase again!",

                "review_body": "I had a faucet-mount, bypass water filter a very long time ago. I've been using a name brand counter-top 'pitcher' for many years recently. I change my filters every 3-4 weeks, so when I saw this faucet mounted system, with a filter that lasts up to 90 days, I thought it made sense to try it! Having installed the previous faucet-mounted one I had, and assembled rooms full of Swedish and particle board furniture over the decades, I was pretty confident this would be no problem to install. I was mistaken. It took a bit to make sense of which type of mounting I would be doing (think innie vs. outie belly buttons and then an alien third option) and which pieces-parts I would need for that process. I separated out the parts I wouldn't need (it's great that they include everything so you don't have to pick when ordering, before you've even figured out what you have, or so you have the option to move it at some point in the future to another location). I removed my existing sprayer first, so I knew my sink had an outie. I put the ring on first, put the included washer in the main body of the unit, put that up to the faucet and tightened the white plastic ring. Well, I turned it... it sort of tightened, but then just before feeling really secure, it loosened again like the threads were stripped, but they aren't. I re-'tightened' it. I turned on the water slowly and the filter worked. The water tasted good. I wanted more so I turned the faucet on more and the unit shot off the faucet into the sink. I removed it, took out the washer, put it back on and turned the water on. I got water shooting out of the faucet, where the unit is mounted. Nope. Gotta have a washer. I happen to have one in my tool box that is half the thickness of the one the manufacturer provided. Unfortunately, it was a fraction smaller in diameter, but I tried it anyway. The mount tightened so I was very hopeful. Unfortunately, when I turned on the faucet, the whole rig flew off the faucet again. I'm keeping it because it's possible that the 'outie' portion of my faucet is removable, but since doing so will damage it and likely make it unusable, I am not going to try that route and the 'innie' mount parts/process until I have a replacement sprayer ready to go if it still doesn't work. The filtered water did taste very good, so I recommend giving it a try. At this price, if you can get it installed securely, and the filters really do last closer to 90 days... it's well worth it.",

Look elsewhere if possible.\n\nI'm  not sure what happened to their quality.\nThe seat this replaced was much sturdier and felt a lot more comfortable.\nThis one is bendy, and thinner, and sits recessed in and down into the toilet very slightly. This means you won't be able to add a bidet addition if you had a mind to.\n\nFor the price of the seat, you can buy a different toilet that will fit any seat you want..\n\nI'm actually looking for a regular straight hinged replacement if anyone has one they can recommend. It's a mystery to me how anyone rated this one so highly.",

For some unknown reason, Kohler designers felt compelled to change the attaching \"hardware\" to a sub-standard design using plastic bolts and plastic wing nuts.  One of the bolts will not tighten properly and the seat loosens constantly. In this case, spending this kind of money on a Kohler product was not worth it at all.

Replacement Kohler toilet seat itself is a decent part, with a shape and color that matches the old (discontinued toilet in 1995) but the hardware mount is lame, insufficient and simply does not hold the seat down to the unit. The washer has an option for long or short fit to ensure that this seat would work with multiple similar units. The problem is the the reversible washer does not work and renders the moulded bracket unstable. The only way to make secure is to bore out a larger hole in the washer and then use a nylon bolt and locking washer (from original toilet) and a trip to Home Depot, in order to create a pressure fit. Once that was complete, the seat will remain somewhat stable, but overall this is a design fail. I give it a D- Kohler.",

The quick release system is a good idea for ease of cleaning, but it keeps the seat from being really firmly attached to the bowl. Worse, the plastic \"nut\" was designed for a tapered hole, apparently something Kohler began using in later designs. The tapered nut contacts the straight hole in the Rialto in such a way that, when you tighten it, it does not \"cinch up\" on the bolt but just strips and turns. I ended up replacing the included hardware with a brass tank bolt set from the local hardware store, which finally got the seat hardware firmly attached to the bowl. Sheesh.

First, most toilet seats are soft closing and made of solid wood or heavy plastic. and run around $39-$49.  This one does not and isn't either and costs $120.  Next, I have installed probably 30+ toilet seats in my several homes over the course of my life and have never had this kind of difficulty.  The plastic receivers that the bolt screws into, cannot be tightened all the way.  Then you put he clamp on to make it fixed and all is good until someone sits on it and the bolt strips and the seat gets completely loose again.  I ultimately had to find the right size stainless steel Nuts and bolts and install them.  I need to also install a lock nut as they get loose also over time.  Bottom line, the seat is horrible quality and the installation is a joke.  Do not ever waste your money on this \"garbage\".",

The item was supposed to be new, so I assume that Kohler's inspection and quality control is somewhat substandard.  Given the $90 cost, I would expect a bit more care in checking the quality of items that are shipped.  After receiving a replacement, the seat installed quickly although I had the same problem as many others in removing the old seat from the toilet.  The seat is attached via anchors on the top surface of the seat area and the bolts tend to rust making them almost impossible to remove.  I was luckier than most people as one of the bolts actually unscrewed; however, the other one required a couple of hours trial and error before I resorted to using a crowbar and prying it and the anchor out.  The first anchor was reused, but the second required another couple of hours to find some sort of anchoring system to hold the seat in place.  The seat is fine but I am a bit disappointed in Kohler overall.",

Doubled nutted the Rods to keep it in place after I adjusted to support the weight. I also made a frame to support the pipe to keep it from moving around and causing leaks. I suggest that you wrap the 1\u201d male pipe going into the head with 14 wraps of Teflon tape. Tighten them down all the way until tight but don\u2019t over tighten. Then back the fittings out completely and rewrap them with 14 more turns of Teflon tape. Tighten them back down . Use a good amount of grease that they supplied to BOTH sides of the \u201cO\u201d ring and to the plastic threads on the filter housing. Tighten by hand only. After you energize the system then use the wrench to tighten to stop any leaks.",

Our water has noticeably improved, no longer has a chemical smell and, thankfully, tastes like nothing :)  We receive water from Cary, North Carolina water system, which passes all government requirements for safe drinking water.  However, it amazes me what gets filtered out of the water with this system!  I have recommended this products to my neighbors and I would definitely recommend it to any other concerned homeowner - especially if you have children.  I recently changed the filter after 11 months of use and could not believe what was filtered out even on a seemingly healthy municipal water system. It pays for itself easily by not having to buy bottled water or pitcher type filters.  Fresh clean water from any tap in the house.

                "review_body": "Our water tasted terrible and was somewhat corrosive to copper pipe due to city water additives.  After fixing several pinhole leaks in our copper piping and paying to have a slab leak repaired, I decided to install a whole house water filtration system.  I decided on the Home Master 2 stage whole house system because it had good reviews, was affordable, and seemed to be relatively easy to install as a DIY project.\n\nI was restricted to a small area of free space for the installation and wanted to keep extra plumbing to a minimum.  I soon discovered that the direction of flow was opposite of what I needed.  In order to maintain the proper flow direction, I was able rotate the housing within the mounting bracket.\n\nThe next problem I encountered was mounting the unit.  For some reason, my wall studs were 14\" on center instead of 16\" so I had to install a horizontal mounting board.\n\nI used Pex to tie into my existing copper and added the necessary shut off valves as well as a bypass valve.  Using Pex made the job so much easier.  As others have noted, I had to use plenty of Teflon tape to get a water tight connection on the inlet and output ports.  I used 1\" to 3/4\" Pex male reducers which bottomed out at the shoulder. The instructions recommend using 3\" pipe nipples.  If I had to do it again, I would use the recommended nipples and female adapters which would have prevented the fittings bottoming out.\n\nOne minor complaint is that they give you a marginal amount of silicon grease to properly install the filters.  I used every bit and had to buy more in order to get a good seal.\n\nOverall, I am very pleased with the final installation and the much improved taste of our water.  Time will tell if this helps solve the corrosive issues I have with our city water.",

                "review_body": "Installed this filter purchased on Amazon bout two weeks ago myself with bypass loop and its working nicely. If you're handy with basic plumbing, you'll have no problems at all.. Only issue with install was leakage where the 1\" npt fitting went into the filter assembly. Twice I used proper thread sealant and got leaking. Finally tried teflon tape which EVERY article you read will tell you not to do and no leaks. two layers of tape wrapped in the proper direction did the job...  clockwise starting at the front of the fitting and winding back just like the threading. The Chloramine/chlorine smell was gone immediately and water seems to taste better too. Little bit of black carbon dust for the first couple gallons but ran clear after that. I purged the filters after install only using the utility sink in bsmt to keep it out of the other lines in the house. Once before when doing plumbing work I had to remove diffusers on kitchen and bath faucet cause of reduced water flow...  sediment from cpvc plumbing install so thats why I purged through the bsmt sink. Installation was very easy and the filters popped in without an issue. There are potential chloramine health issues beyond regular chlorine that could affect health but of course, \"official\" sources say its no problem. Showers are the main concern as hot water on the scalp and skin is a clearer pathway for absorbtion but I'm guessing that gut flora could be affected too. We'll see how long the filters last, they are rated at 1 year but its only two of us so I'm guessing longer. I'm also an organic gardener and didnt want the chloramine gettin into the beautiful, live soil I've worked so hard to build up with compost and compost tea to enhance the micro biodiversity that creates healthier, tastier vegetables. I did alot of research on filter systems and for the price,  this is the best deal out there for municipal water. Check you water companys comprehensive test report to see what potential contaminants to target. This will last a lifetime and we'll never have to worry bout health issues from contaminants that arent \"supposed\" to be there.",

I used 1\u201d by 3/4\u201d bushing reducers and sweat copper with bypass and pressure gauge on inlet side. I already have another gauge further down so I can check pressure drop.

Plus, the filter changing requires ten steps. Step 5 is A) Pour 2 cups of bleach in the filter housings. B) Drain your hot water heater C) Open the main water supply D) Open a faucet at the furthest point from the system until you smell chlorine. Flush the toilet. Do this at every point in your house. E) Close the water supply F) Open the housing. The other steps proceeding this, and after this are easy. But holy #)&!, I'm a reasonably handy guy and I'm ready to call a plumber.\n\nUPDATE: Did it myself. Including time spent bandaging a small wound, it took almost two hours. Instructions are not as complete as you'd think, even with ten steps. Instead of simply saying \"drain the water heater\", it should say, \"follow the manufacturers instructions for draining your water heater\". Those instructions include things like turning off the gas and how to relight the pilot when you are finished. Other details not included are, after draining the water heater, I assume you'd close the drain faucet before (C) opening the main water supply. Or all the water will run out of the water heater drain.  And before (F) I assume you need to open a nearby faucet to relieve the pressure so the housing can be opened again.",

                "review_body": "Pros:\n- 1\u201d Inlet/Outlet ports won't restrict water pressure\n- High quality water from 2 Stage Sediment & Carbon Composite Filters\n- Filters only need replaced once a year up to 100,000 gallons (saves money)\n- Ease of installation\n- Sturdy metal wall mount bracket\n- Overall construction is very solid\n\nCons:\nInlet/Outlet port threads are plastic & not metal. The company said these female threaded ports take standard 1\u201d male tapered (NPT) fittings, but I think their tolerance is to loose for plastic threads.  I had trouble getting tight seal with no drips around my 1\u201d to 3/4\u201d Adapters (1\u201d male tapered on outside & 3/4\u201d female on inside).  To these Adapters I connected Sharkbites with 3/4\u201d male pipe thread x 3/4\u201d push-to-connect on the other side for my water line. I used 3 wraps of Teflon tape on my Adapters and they still had a slow drip around the housing. I took them out, re-wrapped them with Teflon tape, and then coated with Oatey Pipe Joint Compound that is safe for drinking water. This finally stopped my slow leak after 1 week. I think they need to double check the tolerance and depth of these threaded ports.\n\nMy Adapters were completely tight & the nut went all the way down to the Port housing (even with the Teflon tape & Pipe Joint Compound), but they did not bottom out on the inside of the threaded port. Sharkbite does make a 3/4\u201d push-to-connect x 1\u201d Male Pipe Thread Adapter that can be purchased online through Home Depot but they were not available when I did this project. However, none of the stores in my area carry this specialty item (they want you to order a box of 25). This would have made the job a lot easier and probably would Not have had any leaks, but I'm not buying a whole box when I only need 2!  For this price maybe the company could have provided the correct 1\u201d to 3/4\u201d Adapters since a majority of Homes have 3/4\u201d lines. I took off 1 Star because of this frustration, but it does Not take away from the High Quality water this unit makes.\n\nComments:\nI installed this in July 2015 and have been using for 6 months now. Overall this is a quality product with high quality water.  I would definitely recommend this to any Home owner wanting to improve the quality of their water while keeping the total cost around $500 (this kit plus additional plumbing supplies). This has removed all odors & bad tastes which is good since our water is high in sediment, minerals, & chlorine. We have noticed better lather from shampoo & body wash, and our laundry detergent seems to work better. I only took off 1 star due to the initial leaks I had with their 1\u201d ports as described in my Cons.\n\nFor DIY'ers I recommend using Sharkbite T's, Elbows, & Quarter-turn Valves to avoid having to sweat pipe with torch & solder. They cost more but reduce the work time. I have used them for many plumbing projects and never had one leak. I configured mine with 3 Quarter-turn Valves: 1 on the Input side, 1 on the Output side, and 1 as a Bypass above the unit. The Bypass Valve allows water to the house while the Input/Output Valves are closed to do annual maintenance (cleaning the Canisters & replacing Filters).\n\nMy main water line comes in my basement so this unit is mounted on the cement wall. Instead of Tapcon masonry bolts I used 3/8\u201d x 3\u201d Red Head Wall Anchor w/Hex Nuts. These mount securely in the cement wall and leave a threaded bolt sticking out of the wall about 1/2\u201d. Just hang the Filter Housing Wall Mount Bracket onto the Red Head bolts, add washers, and tighten down the Hex Nuts. The Red Heads and Sharkbites make it easy to remove if it ever needs to be taken down or the re-positioned.",

After doing some Internet research nan reading reviews, we purchased this unit. We had our local handy man install the unit. It was installed in our garage after the cold water shut off and pressure valve. he installed the shut off valve on each side of unit as directions encouraged. The unit is a good three feet by three feet in size and fairly heavy. So we mounted it on a wall, making sure to add appropriate support board behind it. Probably took the handy man about two hours total. Its very important to make sure you hoo the plumbing up to flow from left to right. There are arrows on the unit.\n\nThis is a two stage unit. First filter is for sediment and the second filter if for chlorine.\n\nWe have soft water, but due to the water coming from a small river that usually is muddy, the water although clean did have sediment (you could see particles in glass of water when held up to light) and tons of chlorine. We flushed the filters prior to hooking up to house lines. When some water and was surprised that almost instantly the water was clearly and better tasting. I was expecting that it might take a day or two. Nope, water smelled better, looked better, tasted better within two hours.\n\nIts been about two weeks. This purchase was worth every dime!!\n\nIf you've been thinking of a whole house unit, then don't look any further then Home Master. Now please verify what you have in your water Chlorine or Chloramines. Home Master makes different models based upon what you need to filter. If you have a well, then you probably should consider the three stage unit.",

I had read good reviews about Niagara's other showerheads, and thought I'd give this one a try as my family needed to cut back on our water usage, and showers were a major portion of our water bill.\n\nWe use this primarily at the 1 gpm setting. It provides an unbelievably good shower and the water is definitely warmer than what came out of our old spray showerhead. Desipte the low-flow, it is comfortable and refreshing. Very impressive! I'm sold on this brand. I'm going to replace our second showerhead with another one of Niagara Conservation's showerheads.\n\nOne caveat is that we currently have a fairly small shower stall, not a full-size shower nor a bath/shower combination. The ability of this shower head to give you a comfortably warm shower may depend on the temperature of your bathroom and size of your shower stall. Less hot water and steam coming from the shower head will effectively reduce how much it heats the bathroom. However, here in temperate California in a small shower, it works wonderfully.",

Coming from a 2.5 GPM shower head the 1.5 GPM leaves nothing to be desired in terms of flow. It is satisfying and quickly wets and rinses my thick, long hair. I do find the 1 GPM setting generally unsatisfying for showering, the pressure is too low to effectively shampoo and there is not enough steam generated to keep warm in a full sized shower (this may become more of an issue in winter). The water is definitely aerated, but the stream temperature is not perceptibly decreased. It is best used for soaping up, rinsing off, or when you feel like relaxing for a few minutes.\n\nMy main issue with this shower head is the spray pattern. It is a single circle. While this is not terrible, a second concentric circle would have been good. It would provide better water coverage (increasing warmth) and for those of us who are not vertically inclined make it easier to comfortably wash our faces. Unless you can put your face right against the shower head you receive a single strong arc of water which effectively demonstrates why the feel of raindrops on your face is relaxing and a firehose is not.",

                "review_body": "The adjustable flow is nice.  My wife was concerned about washing her hair (her hair is thick and comes down to just between her shoulder blades) with the lower flow shower heads.  We have since both discovered that the 1.0 Gal/Min setting (which is probably really lower since our water pressure is 41 psi) is fine for all our needs.  However, the higher flow setting is nice as it gets colder because we do not have a tankless water heater so the low flow setting requires us to wait several minutes for the water to get warm.\n\nI would recommend this for anyone taking their first steps into water conservation or for anyone who has a large shower.  Below 1 GPM, shower heads tend to aerate the water to give the water flow pressure which means the water looses its heat faster, thus requiring you set the water to a warmer setting which uses more energy to get your water hotter so it's warm enough.\n\nI bought this with the Evolve \"Showerheads SS-1002CP-US Ladybug Water-Saving Shower-Head Adapter\" which lets you know the water is warm by bringing the flow down to a trickle and I honestly couldn't be happier.  The combo works well, and prevents us from wasting water as we set about doing other things while waiting for the water to warm up.",

We also have the Niagra Tri-max showerhead in the shower we use daily.  (The Tri-max at 0.5 gpm is the way to go to really save water.)  The Bi-max provides a great shower on the 1 gpm setting; I can't see a need to raise it to the 1.5 gpm, even for hair washing.  This showerhead also has a very comfortable and sufficiently broad spray pattern on both settings, more comfortable in fact than the Tri-max.  I also measured the flow on the 1 gpm setting and it is dead accurate.  It would have been nice if Niagara included a washer with the showerhead, since it takes a lot of Teflon tape and torque to seal it on the shower arm, but that's a very minor complaint.",

My only complaint is that the part that connects to the shower pipe is plastic, and seems marginally too thin for the task. Tightening it \"just right\" seems a balance between too loose (which is what I elected to do) and too tight, which seems like it will strip the plastic threads. When adjusting the shower head from higher to lower flow rate while taking a hot shower there is a pronounced tendency for the shower head to unscrew.  If it were made with a metal fitting it would be easier to tighten properly and less likely to come loose. (And yes, if that added to the cost of it I would pay it, because the shower head is otherwise well made and worth it.)",

They do include a deck plate in case you need it. I've seen a few other faucet manufacturers charge extra for that accessory.\n\nInstallation was simple and pretty straight forward even for me the guy who tends to make a disaster out of home improvement projects.

This allows it to function even within close proximity to a backsplash behind the faucet.\nThe lever operates very smoothly due to the ceramic valves. It has a very nice feel to it.\nThe spring coiled neck and spray head give a nice amount of flexibility and reach. It isn't as much compared to pull down versions that have longer hoses, but it can be left in the free moving position during heavy use with the arm bar rotated to the side. This is a different approach compared to pull down spray heads which don't function well when left in the pulled out position.\n5 stars for a quality fixture.",

Didn\u2019t want to get a cheap one that would only last a couple years. Found this on Amazon and she couldn\u2019t be happier with it.\n\nIt took me forever to install this but it wasn\u2019t the Elkays fault. I couldn\u2019t get the old sink out. every time I would turn the old plastic locking rings they would break. Long story short I got a friends help and once the old one was out the new one was a breeze to install.\n\nThis Elkay was simple to install. The directions are step by step on how to install it.\n\nOne thing I really like about this pull out faucet is simplicity. I thought it would be on a Wind up thing to pull it in and out but nope! It literally has a weight that when you pull it down the weight comes with it and when you release it that weight goes back up. It\u2019s super easy and it works flawlessly even tho it\u2019s so simple. I guess you would want that tho because less moving parts means less things to break.\n\nAll of the parts with this Faucet are quality well made items.\nFrom the lines to the locking rings, they are not the cheap stuff like what I took off.",

I gave it 2 stars across the board.\nIt's easy to install but it doesn't seal.\nIt's not great value for the money if it doesn't seal.\nIts easy to use except it doesn't seal.",

How can this not be fixed by now?? My husband installed second pot filler and this too leaks at both joints. Called company and they are sending us a third pot filler.

This faucet is the fourth replacement of faucets produced in another country nearby Taiwan.  I am certain this one will last a good number of years.

Very nicely made - I used plumber's silicone in the base, around the faucet mechanism (open / close handle), and inside the swivel - plumber's silicon is food safe and simply helps.

                "review_body": "Update: I got a replacement - STILL wrong sized bolts. I have some bolts from an older order to compare to, so I've uploaded some photos of them beside each other. As you can see, the correct bolts are noticeably thicker and beefier. Even the head is considerably thicker, not just wider. And in the second photo you can see that the nuts that come with the incorrect, smaller bolts are still the nuts for the thicker bolts, so they don't fit the smaller ones at all - you can clearly see light between the nut and the bolt. The nuts can slide freely down the bolt, so the bolts and nuts you'll receive can't be used together - probably rendering them worthless like the ones I've received.\n\nI just received the wrong-sized bolts. I have three others I've ordered and they are all correctly 3/8\" by 3 1/8\". However, exactly like another reviewer, the bolts don't fit the nuts. The other reviewer mistakenly thought the nuts were the wrong size, but it's the bolts that are the wrong size - they're much too small. It wouldn't have been obvious to me if I hadn't been ordering these to be able to compare them. I believe the fault lies with Lasco since the package label, nuts, and rubber washers are all correct - someone just put in the wrong bolts. So until this bad inventory is cleared out, you may want to hold off - or be prepared to send them back and roll the dice again.\n\nAside from this one mix up, the bolts are fantastic compared with typical toilet hardware. Solid brass and *very* beefy!",

The other set contained 2 brass bolts, 6 rubber washers, 4 not-brass washers, and 4 not-brass nuts.  (Short two nuts and two washers.)  The bolts are all 3\" x 5/16\", not 3/8\" diameter as described.  The metal washers and nuts are non-magnetic, but definitely not brass.

Now, less than two years later, this probably-made-in-China sad excuse of a faucet is already dripping with a steady stream of water unless we play with the lever until it stops dripping.  The handle movement is no longer smooth either, but binds up as one attempts to turn the faucet off or attempts to manipulate the lever to change the temperature of the water.",

When other manufacturers have innovated and made supply lines that literally click in place and connect from the T and snap in place, there\u2019s NO excuse for Kingston still using the teflon tape and threaded nut approach. Plus both valve stems seem to be the same valve, meaning the supply ports face the same direction when attached. According to the (horrible and incomplete) instruction sheet diagram both valve stem supply outlets should be facing outward, in opposite directions, not possible with the valve stems I have in the box. Also, they provided braided water supply hoses, but I don\u2019t see any flexible tubes for the supply T to valve stem connection. If you want to be frustrated like it\u2019s 1990 all over again, but this, otherwise go with Price Pfister or other more up to date brand. They install in a fraction of the time, I should know I have installed many many faucets.",

I mounted it to an extra knockout on the soap ledge of a composite granite sink.  This faucet does have a few drawbacks.  First, my sink is about 5/8\" thick at this location and is about the maximum sink thickness allowed.  I could not use a supply line with a plastic end, only a metal end which is a little shallower.  I could not use the included rubber washers either.  Another potential problem was the base of the faucet being about 1.5\" and the knockout holes of my sink being 1.5\" also and no extra space to add washers.  The attached aerator is plastic and had to be destroyed to be removed.  This faucet requires a male threaded aerator (or a male-male adapter in my case because I only had a female dishwasher adapter).  Inside the aerator, I felt the flow was a little restricted, so I cleaned up the rough edges with a Dremel, but this isn't necessary.  Once everything was connected and seemed okay, it sat for a few hours before running the dishwasher.  After this first use, the faucet started leaking about 3 drops per second.  I had to remove the handle (screw under the red dot) and the chrome spacer ring, then using a pair of channel-lock pliers, tighten the valve body to stop the leak.  So, I had a couple problems and shortcomings with this faucet, but I bought it specifically for it's small size and single water inlet and removable aerator, and it serves those purposes well.  Keep in mind that this is a really cheap faucet, and if I had known nothing about how valves work, my review could have easily been negative if I couldn't stop the leak.",

The valve action is smooth and has a high quality feel. You would typically have to pay much more for this level of quality and style. There are some plastic finish parts (shower heads and hand sprays) that go with the valve but that's common these days. The only reason I gave 4 stars is the first valve trim sent had scratches that appeared to be from previously opened packaging. Amazon was quick to send replacements. Highly recommended.",

One annoyance I had though was that the arc always wants to pull back toward center whenever you swivel it.  So if I want to push it all the way to the left or right, I'd have to hold it in place.  I like the faucet so much I just dealt with this.  After 5 years, the pull out spray hose started to fail, so I called Hansgrohe support for a replacement.  It's a proprietary part, so you can't just go to the hardware store.  It did take a while to get someone on the phone, but when I did they sent one under the lifetime warranty 2nd day air no problem.  Since I was already on the phone with support, I mentioned the arc pulling issue.  She said we'll include new glide rings which will fix that problem.  Received them, took about 3 minutes to install, and no more pulling back to center!  If you have this issue, it's an easy fix, and I love my faucet even more now.",

                "review_body": "The Hansgrohe Axor Citterio is a very well made faucet that looks great in minimal modern kitchens or even older 20's era bungalows like ours. The plating is flawless and looks like it will take years of abuse without a sweat. The handle and valve work smoothly, with little effort, and shut the faucet off without dripping. I also like that it doesn't have one of those dinky little rod handles that you see on \"fancy\" faucets\u2014the blade on the Axor is much better looking and is much more of a wrist-blade handle for people who actually cook in their kitchen.\n\nThe install was pretty easy (maybe an hour including removal of the previous?). This is a high-class fixture that does not put looks over function. It has been a workhorse for us that just happens to look great.\n\nMy only issue was the aerator that ships with the Axor doesn't aerate. It literally adds no air so you get this incredibly focused stream of water that splashes all over, even in a very deep sink, making dish-washing and rinsing like a trip to a water park. I solved this by purchasing a 1.5 GPM Aerator for $3 from Home Depot online. I had it shipped to the store for free and it solves this stream issue. Look for the \"Neoperl 1.5 GPM Tom Thumb PCA Aerator\".\n\n*Update*\nI added photos to show how the aerator key works.",

                "review_body": "I saw this faucet at my interior designer's store and it looked so great that I ordered one right away.  I read the online reviews here and saw the comments about how the aerator doesn't mix in air and therefore the water splashes everywhere, but hoped that this was an isolated problem and that my faucet would be fine.  But I had the same problem as everyone else.  The water comes down in a beautiful and strong glass-like stream, but when you wash dishes, the water would splash everywhere.  Every time I washed dishes, the front of my shirt would get splattered.  Very annoying.  But J Lear's review is awesome.  I ordered the Tom Thumb aerator from Amazon - I ordered the 2.2 GPM version (because I like the strong water flow).  My plumber had thrown away the Hansgrohe key to unscrew the end of the faucet, but I called Hansgrohe and they sent me another one for free.  It was easy to unscrew the end, pop out the old aerator and put in the new one.  And problem solved!  No more splashing.  I am not a handy person but this was a very easy switch-out.  Thank you J Lear!\n\nThe faucet itself is beautiful, the lever is very easy and smooth to operate, and the water flow is strong (even with new aerator).  I would recommend this faucet (after switching out the aerator).",

There is no aerator in the faucet so it does not mix ANY air in with the water when it is in the non-stream mode.  I called Hansgrohe figuring they would take care of the problem for me.  I am totally shocked by their response.  They told me to buy a $10 part online to fix the problem.  Seriously?  I just spent $500 on a kitchen faucet and you're not going to send me a part that costs you $1 to make sure i'm a happy customer.  I am very disappointed.  Stay away.",

It's a few bucks and a few minutes, even if you're not mechanically inclined.  2)  You need to dry-fit the unit and test out the range of motion to ensure you aren't bumping into your backsplash or other immovable objects when you go for hot or cold water.  As shown in the picture, (when the handle is making a 90 degree angle) the unit is off.  Moving the handle further to the right, away from the spout, increases water flow.  Moving the handle towards you and away from you (think pulling a slot machine handle) changes the temp.",

Decided on a pull down faucet and wanted one that didn't have plastic for the sprayer. This faucet is sleek and works very smoothly. Didn't think I would like the side lever design but it's brilliant. Easy enough to install after pulling out the prior faucet. The spray is very easy to switch on and coverage in my 15\"x28\"x10\" sink is good. The stream/spray isn't as powerful as my old faucet but that's due to the restrictor they have in it. I didn't bother to replace it as my husband likes to leave the water running when he does dishes. My only quibble is that the sprayer doesn't reseat fully when retracted but it's only 1/8\" and I haven't bothered figuring it out because it's not really that big a deal. It's been 9 months since install and working great. I replaced the side sprayer hole with a reverse osmosis system and that's been great, too.",

I screwed a deck screw into the center of the plastic restrictor. I then used some pliers and applied some force to pull it out. It's in there pretty tight. After I removed it the flow is perfect. I also love the brushed bronze color from Kohler. If you ever need to match this color for other bath accessories the rustoleum metallic paint satin bronze is a great match. We spray painted a bench and some counter accessories and they look great.",

The fitting also serves as a cradle for the handshower unit itself, which in both of my showers is a fairly heavy brass & plastic handshower.  I already installed one of these several years ago in one of my showers, but it was plastic, and I wanted to replace it with brass as is stated in the description of this fitting.  The second unit I bought was for a new shower installation.  Sadly, these fittings are plastic also, so I am returning one of them.  I am forced to use one of them in the new installation.  Ironically, I bought an identical fitting for my daughter's shower remodel a year ago, except it was in chrome.  Her chrome fitting is in fact, solid brass.  A small part of this fitting (the threaded part that screws onto the 1/2\" pipe), is in fact brass, but the rest of the fitting is plastic.  Hopefully it won't break.  I am disappointed.  I don't understand why it is solid brass if chrome plated, but not if oil rubbed bronze.  I don't know about the other finishes.",

The pump assembly sits into the neck of the dispenser and free spins. It is so loose that the top housing moves back and forth like a little bell. The Kohler soap dispenser that finally went bad was a tight fit. In contrast, if you slightly bump the spout of the American Standard it will swing around to the back. The American Standard retails for $121 and bought it on Amazon for $78 (tax included). When I called support from the reseller he stated this was a builder's grade model and not to expect much. I do not consider this a builder's grade product as it is brass and stainless and the only plastic is the bottle and pump. I called the American Standard support line and was informed that this is the way it was designed. I guess it is time to get a new design team. I bought American Standard because they replaced the kitchen sink faucet under their lifetime warranty program. The soap dispenser has a one year warranty so I suspect I will be changing it out for a different manufacturer in a year. I would send it back but at 65 I am tired of wiggling my way under the sink to change it out, my back can only take  so much twisting now a days.",

It might last 2 years or as is the case with the last one only 2 weeks. The leaks are not where the piece screws into the hose, but rather where water comes out in a spray.

What happens is that the buttons used to change between spray and stream stop working properly and the unit is never able to function in the stream mode properly.  Not only have these two units failed miserably but so did the original head that was also the Kingston Brass brand.  I bought 2 OEM models hoping to have the best fit and function, but will now never buy another Kingston Brass product again.  It can not be simply bad luck to have 3 heads fail within the first few weeks of using each of them.  Of course I waited on filing the return for my first replacement to long accidentally and am unable to return it.\n\nAlso a side note, the faucet handle itself gets extremely hot when you are running hot water for dished.  I could understand the head getting hot potentially, but not the handle the controls the water temp and on/off feature of the faucet.  All in all, I don't think the Kingston Brass product line is of good quality.  I doubt I have the entire faucet very long at all.",

The only reason why I switched was because the other one was too dirty and I couldn\u2019t seem to get it clean, so it seemed easier to just replace it. But that stream was wider and harder than this one. I may buy a different one in the future but right now this works, so just keeping it.",

There is evidence of the beginning of dry rot on the flush valve and feel that the seller should send me another one as this one will fail sooner than it should.  Yes, it is technically new and unused but I have no idea how it was stored until now. Also the toilet seat is not included. This picture is not an accurate description of the product.",

I believe that I have adjusted mine to use around 1.3-1.4 gallons per flush.  At any rate, this toilet provides a quick, powerful and effective flush.  Also, at 16\" high, the toilet is 1\" higher that the toilet it replaced.  Finally, the toilet arrived very well packed in 2 cardboard boxes that were easy to handle.",

Called American Standard (expect to be on hold for awhile), she couldn't find the model number listed on Amazon and on the box; did some checks without solving the problem; now you cant' find this model for sale on Amazon.

More often than not a task that \"should only take a few minutes\", ends up taking a few hours due to stuck screws/ frozen fasteners, broken bits or the best, the missing piece! In anticipation I allowed my self two hours to take out the old leaking faucet arrangement and install the Amazon Basics Classic Kitchen Faucet Set with Sprayer. Shockingly the old one, that had been in place for fourteen years, came out relatively easily.  According to Murphy's Law then the installation of the Amazon piece was going to be a royal pain the south end of a north bound pack animal. Nope, glancing at the minimalist instructions and having performed similar tasks before... I was done in just about an hour! Now if I can only get my 36 year old motorcycle to cooperate in a similar fashion...\nAs it has only been installed for a couple of days and not had a lot of use, at present I can't speak to reliability or other long term functionality. Having said that all the pipes are metal braided, color coded too, and it feels solid enough I suspect it will out last the previous model.\nAs far as value for money is concerned, I received this as a review/sample product so, heck yeah!

Behind the sink, there was very little room to get a wrench up there to install the spray diverter.  That took nearly an hour with with tiny rotations to get the top tightened down.\n\nThere were some quality issues, mostly in the engineering of this. One, the base plate, which is not needed at all if you only have a single hole sink. It does not seal all the holes that the 3 holes have in a more conventional design. The sealing ring has about 1/8 an inch on either side that is consistent. This means that water that gets to the outer edges can seep under and down below. While the center is pretty well protected, the outer edges are not is what I am trying to say.\n\nWhen it came to installing the sprayer holster, I put the sealing gasket on top of the sink and placed the holster through it and the sink hole. They recommend it be under the sink with the washer, however, I did not want a collection under the sprayer holster, and chose to do it this way. You will see the black of the o ring, and I may actually switch it later, but I did not see an issue with this.\n\nOutside of installing the main hoses and all the hoses needed for the diverter.  Everything was straight forward and easy. The hoses were long enough for me to install it without any other extensions. This made it really convenient.\n\nI am happy with this, and I hope to see long years with this new faucet. If I do need to get a replacement or I just want an upgrade, replacing this one will be allot easier.\n\nJust as a final note, it does say Amazon Basics on it. But it isn't very conspicuous, being on the back of the handle.",

It just didn't seem as on par with some of the brand name faucets for kitchens as I've checked out at home improvement stores.\n\nThe faucet comes very well packaged with all the parts and info a DIYer needs to install both the faucet and sprayer.  The simplicity of the design and the directions are a definite plus!\n\nThis set is priced right and above average in terms of build quality and finish.  It is a little bit lighter weight as compared to AmazonBasics bathroom faucet fixtures (I have two of those), but it does feel like it will be durable despite this.

                "review_body": "When I bought my house a few months ago it wasn\u2019t that old but not new either.  Most of it was in great shape but some things were either worn, dated or something I wanted to replace for whatever reason.  One thing I generally want to customize when I buy a new house is the sink faucet and this place was no exception. The kitchen sink faucet was a high quality brand and looked okay but the swivel action was tight because of corrosion and the single lever handle was very difficult to adjust.  And worst of all for me was that it did not have a side sprayer, which is high on my list of important things to have.\n\nFINDING THE RIGHT ONE\n\nI shopped for months to find a faucet I liked and that\u2019s not as easy as you think.  The only ones they are displaying these days are the huge high arc restaurant type faucets with pull down sprayers.  I had one of those in my old house and it didn\u2019t suit my lifestyle.  I wanted a more traditional single lever faucet, but the few I could find were mostly chrome plated plastic and very few of them included a side sprayer.  Even the premium famous name brand faucets had at least some of the exposed components made from plastic and also some of the internal parts as well.\n\nIS IT ALL PLASTIC\n\nWhen I saw this one from Amazon Basics I hesitated because my first thought was that it must be 100% plastic for the price. When I saw it firsthand I could not believe it, the entire thing is almost all made entirely of brass and chrome plated metal, even the internal parts that you don\u2019t see.  The only non-metal parts are the rubber washers and a few small minor trim parts.  Even the base plate that covers the unused holes in a 3 or 4 hole sink \u2013 note that this is a single hole faucet \u2013 is chrome plated metal, this is a part that is almost always plastic these days.  The sprayer, however, is chrome plated plastic.  I can live with that because it doesn\u2019t get anywhere near the wear and tear and it is easily replaceable, and the plastic does help keep it from getting too warm like some of the metal ones.\n\nINSTALLATION\n\nAfter removing the old corroded unit, which took most of the installation time, installing the new one was simple. No surprises, no unplanned trips to the parts store, everything fit as expected with one glaring exception, but it\u2019s an important one and this is something you should pay close attention to.  My steel sink has four standard sized holes, three for the faucet and one for the sprayer.  As mentioned this faucet is designed for mounting in a single hole sink but comes with a trim plate to cover the hot and cold water holes on a three hole sink.  Except it doesn\u2019t.  The trim plate is about a half inch too short to completely cover what would be the hot water hole and there is no amount of adjusting that can make it fit.  That would be unacceptable and I would not have continued with the installation but I came up with an idea \u2013 I shifted the entire assembly over to the left so the feed lines are now routed through the hot water hole and I am using the cold water hole for the side sprayer, which left me with an unused hole that I used to add an under-sink soap dispenser pump.\n\nSOLUTION\n\nWhat that does is to move the water flow directly over my garbage disposal, which worked out to be a big positive, and to let the water spout have full range of motion over the left sink basin but still be able to swing enough over the right basin to use it on that side as well.  It sounds strange but it looks good and works well and let me add a built-in soap dispenser using the fourth hole.  I\u2019m telling you all of the positives because I had to adapt to a negative situation caused by a bad product design but I should make it clear that I deducted a point for that, not everyone might have the same flexibility as me to settle for an off-center faucet.  I suggest the designers go back to the drawing board and come up with a better design for the trim plate.\n\nYEA OR NAY\n\nIn use I am satisfied with the look, feel, water pressure, smoothness of operation, ease of installation and high quality of materials.  At an even hundred bucks at the time I got it I think it is a worthwhile contender compared to the major brand names and is far superior to most of the no-name brands I looked at.",

Initial impressions were that it's a lot nicer quality than I was expecting and significantly nicer than the 60 dollar sink option at the local hardware store, where that's the least expensive option and it gets more expensive from there. The quality of those faucets is really poor and they wear out quickly. This faucet is a lot nicer, and you can feel it as soon as you grab the faucet handle to turn it on. It feels heavy and it's easy to control flow and temperature with one hand. The faucet neck is a classic lower profile design which helps to keep water from spraying everywhere if you don't have a deep sink. The braided lines for hot and cold water are color coded, making installation easy. A lot of faucets do not do this so it was a nice detail to see. This faucet set comes with the escutcheon plate but it can be installed with or without it. I have an older sink with several holes so I used the plate and it looks nice. The chrome seems to be fairly high quality and hasn't scratched at all during the install or after cleaning it a few times.\n\nI've installed a decent amount of kitchen faucets over the years, not professionally but in different homes I've lived in. It's not difficult but the older your old faucet is, the more trouble you are likely to have. It helps to have plenty of lighting under the sink and the right tools, although you can install this faucet with pretty much just a crescent wrench and Phillips screwdriver for the spray nozzle. A hex wrench is included. The instructions call for using a bit of teflon tape but I didn't use any and there are no leaks so that may be something you'll need and it's not included in the set.\n\nSome people don't like or want to have a sprayer in their sink, but instead of not using it, I'd recommend installing it under the sink and making a little hook for it because it's good to have sometimes. It doesn't leak and if you never use it, it won't hurt anything. This is what I did since I put a soap dispenser in the hole where the sprayer is supposed to go and I didn't want to cut another hole in the top of my sink basin.\n\nOverall, I am impressed with the quality of this faucet and how it works. I do have one complaint and it's the same for all AmazonBasics products. They insist on laser engraving the unattractive AmazonBasics logo on the top of the faucet handle (visible in the second stock photo). Fortunately, it's not super noticeable in person unless you are right on top of it but it's kind of annoying. I wish Amazon would come up with a cool stylized and subtle mark for their products. There's no way to rub it off, it's etched into the metal. Might be a deal breaker for some so I thought I'd mention it. Overall, a nice faucet for the price. It's very similar to more expensive models I've seen from Delta and Moen and it's likely made by a well known faucet manufacturer, but I'm not sure who it is since there are no obvious markings on the facuet anywhere.",

We replaced an older system that we could no longer get filters for, so installation was easier than if you are installing for the first time. The only reason I dropped it a star is because they have the filters listed here, but it was a chore to find them.  Further, they are almost the price of the contraption itself.  Hoping for a non OEM part here.",

However, while cleaning up today my son found a small package that had somehow gotten under the sofa. He was the one who initially unpacked the unit for me and assisted and he swore up and down he unpacked everything properly. I will point out that the list of included pieces does not mention the vital connector piece so it was easier to possibly overlook it falling out the box.  The ordeal being done and the system installed, I can say its performance is alright.\n\nThe handle is a bit stiff to turn and to me it doesn't have quite the crispness that my old filter seemed to have, but the major issue of the chlorine is resolved. It also was a little awkward to hang under the cabinet and I have to modify the space a bit to get it work. I settled on four star because the instructions and parts list were still not up to par. In terms of value for price, we will see how well it performs over time and I will update in the future with pictures and any developments.",

I have zero experience plumbing and was able ti get this installed with relative ease once the previous faucet was out.\n\nThe water is clear and tastes good once you run the water to purge the filters. The faucet handle turns smoothly.\n\nI did have some minor issues with the installation however.\n\nThe biggest problem I ran into was that the hole in my counter was too large. We were able to improvise with a large shiny washer so it looks like it belongs but this is the kind of thing that should be included with the kit. (Or the bottom of the faucet should just be made larger).\n\nA minor issue was that the pieces included were odd quantities. It included 5 screws (one of which looked different from the others) but only called for 2. It also called for at least three of the blue plastic locking pieces, and really could have used more, but only included 2.\n\nThe instructions also don't specify that you should use the plumber's tape (the white tape included).\n\nOverall, it's a decent unit but plan on getting a large washer and a thin rubber one to put under it.",

                "review_body": "This is one of the most compact designs that I have ever seen for water filtration systems, especially this extra effective three-barrel version. Normally, these are very bulky and it requires quite a bit of rearranging under the sink to fit them as well as reconfiguration of the piping, but this water filter is both small and easy to install. It is about the size of three standard water bottles if that gives you perspective! The directions are super easy to follow and help you install this all on your own, no plumber is needed which saves a ton of money and time! It starts working right away and there is a noticeable difference in water quality. Personally, I can tell that there is much less alkaline taste (I live in LA where the water is notoriously bad) so this has been a lifesaver.\n\nAdditionally, the rust-resistant lining and filtration system make this perfect for older homes or apartments. I live in an older apartment where the pipes are prone to rusting and infecting the water. With little kids often in my apartment, I want to make sure I am giving them the purest water possible. This creates so much peace of mind for me and my family and it would for anyone living in an area with unsustainable tap water. This is also a much more cost-efficient option for homeowners than replacing pipes and it helps relieve space by not making you get a Brita filter for the fridge.\n\nOverall, this is a great option for older homes and for people trying to save space. I highly recommend it!",

                "review_body": "We had a perfectly working brita under the sink 3 stage filter that became obsolete. The filters we no longer possible to find anywhere. Since the install was already done, I was hoping to keep most of it in place and just swap out the filter system. Unfortunately, the water tubes on this system is a smaller diameter.\n\nWorking under the sink is always a chore. One thing that made this install a little easier, is that installing the faucet is toolless thanks to the large thumb disc nut. Unfortunately, the basin knockout is barely larger than the diameter of the faucet base and I had to improvise a spacer.\n\nThe valve inlet will fit on a larger or smaller fitting by way of an adapeter. The outlet on the other hand may or may nor require an adapter depending on the diameter of your waterline. I was able to reuse the adapter that I had installed for the previous water filter system. Otherwise, it would have had to been a trip to the local hardware store.\n\nThe rest of the install was super easy.  The flush process is basically the same as other filter systems. The faucet had decent water flow.\n\nOverall, simple to install and works as expected.\n Hopefully, the filters will be available when the time comes.\n\nUpdate: well, it is not as bad as the brita complete lack of replacement filters, but the brio 3 stage filter kit sold on amazon is not the correct replacement for this model. In fact, if you go to the brio page, they list the three replacement filters seperately. And they do not sell those as a kit. In total, the filters are just about as expensive as a whole new setup.\n\nAnd I did not originally note this, like the other reviews, I too had to improvise a washer for the too small in diameter faucet base.",

The retaining clip that is supposed to hold the overflow plate tight to the tub wound up just damaging the tub, as it did not use an actual two piece plate design. Instead they cheaped out for some weird half moon paper clip looking device that wound up just bending and scratching the tub. The machine work inside the actual brass T was terrible, and could easily catch hair and other debris and lead to an easily clogged drain. Wound up having to port the inside of the T to give it smooth transitions so that water would flow more easily. The nut for the bottom extension into the trap is not included at all, which means you are taking a trip to the local hardware store even AFTER buying this kit.",

The item was received in the amount of time I was expecting. It was very easy to put together. Just a few parts need to be inserted. I was impressed with the different heights the handle was able to be raised. I had look on Amazon to find a rail of this nature. I choose this railing based on the great reviews. Also the price was right. I had seen other railings that were too expensive for my budget. The didn't have the ability to be raised or lowered to fit your height. The Bathtup safety rail is very sturdy. I like that it fits tight against my bathtub. With the ability to adjust it on my bath tub gave me the ability to place it close to the commode making it dual purpose for me. I no longer have the fear that my foot will not be raised high enough to exit the tub. I would purchase this rail again and recommend it too others who have a deep tub. It is also very sturdy and should hold any weight.",

                "review_body": "I knew how cheap these are there would be difficulties in the install.\nThe first problem is that it is very unlikely that the 3/8\" ports are in alignment once you get the handles and diverter installed NO MATTER HOW you twist and turn and set the valves.  The included two short copper pipes will not be of much use.\n\nThe second problem is that the H/C valves have a right angle on the 3/8\" ports which makes it hard/impossible to squeeze in a  stainless 3/8\" flex hose to connect to the diverter.  Essentially the ports are out of alignment to directly use the provided copper pipes but too close together to finagle in the hoses because the coupling ends conflict with each other.\n\nIn the end I had to use two right angle 3/8\" compression elbows on the diverter and two 3/8\"-to3/8\" compression hoses to get it hooked up.  Also I replaced the el-cheapo nylon 20\" 3/8\" compression hose to sprayer with a stainless hose.\n\nThus I spent an extra $25 in stainless hoses and $15 in compression elbows to hook this up  (plus of coarse two stainless hoses to get to wall H/C).  So in the end the extra $40  still makes it a lot  cheaper than the name brand units.  If you're an advanced DIY'r  you can do the above.  If not you probably want to just suck it up and buy the expensive units.",

                "review_body": "After almost not buying due to several negative reviews, I felt I should share my positive experience with a kit I purchased in September of 2016.\n\nI purchased this kit along with a Toto Piedmont bidet \u2013 the cheapest way I could get a new bidet in the states (I needed to replace a non-functional bidet prior to selling a house).\n\nWhile I am intermediate to advanced in most aspects of handymanry, I am not very good with plumbing, but I was still able to install the new bidet with this faucet in less than two hours. The installation wasn't \"easy,\" but I don't see how it could be made much better for any four-hole bidet faucet installation.\n\nThe tube that came with my kit to deliver water from the diverter to the aerator was already nylon. If this had been copper, as I think was the case in earlier models, it would have been a little more frustrating. I also replaced the copper tubes from the supply (hot/cold) valves to the diverter valve with polystyrene because the holes in the bidet weren't in alignment and I didn't trust myself to make an accurate bend in such a short piece of copper. 1' of tubing and 4 brass inserts cost less than $3; I reused the ferrules and nuts from this kit. Nylon and polystyrene are easier to install than copper, but give the manufacturer some credit: copper is superior over time.\n\nAnd as for the reports of a weak jet, the spray reaches about 18\" when both hot and cold supplies are 100% and the diverter is 100% open to the aerator, but the jet stays low until at about 80% of total volume.\n\nOverall, the installation experience was no more frustrating than any other plumbing job of similar magnitude, and the faucet works well.",

As our Winnebago Micro Mini has gone through its paces, we have identified some \"improvements\" that were needed, one of which was the two handle H/C bathroom sink faucet.  The cheap plastic squeaked and was difficult to adjust.\n\nThe faucet placement in my RV is a 4\" spaced two hole - not three as most bath faucets.  The Chicago faucet mounts on two holes at 4\", and is a very heavy duty metal unit and was a direct fit replacement for the Winnie faucet.  No tools required to replace it, I simply unscrewed the old one and installed the new one.  This one protrudes into the sink basin about 3/4\" more than the original, but it is not an issue.\n\nOverall very happy with this upgrade.",

                "review_body": "This was purchased as part of our kitchen remodel. Our kitchen designer suggested the vibrant brushed stainless steel to go better with our new dark stained cabinets and stainless steel appliances. I already owned this faucet in polished chrome and thought I'd just use that. His suggestion was that the polished chrome has a more blue tone to the finish where the brushed stainless steel has a warmer tone and would look better with the wood cabinets. I usually like the polished chrome, easily wiped down, sparkling mirror finish...he had me thinking and I decide to try the brushed stainless. I am glad I did, it does look much better with the espresso stain color of my cabinets. The brushed finish does not show water spots and is easy to wipe down and always looks nice and clean.  The faucet design is nice and has a traditional look. I love the water handle especially when your hands are dirty you can use the back of your hand to simply push the handle to turn on the water. I also like the sprayer it has two \"shower\" patterns one is a cone shaped water spray, the other is more straight line spray with a harder spray which is useful when rinsing down the sides of the sink.  I purchased separately a Kohler soap dispenser that mounts in the countertop in the same finish (shown in photo doesn't come with faucet). I also purchased the sink drain and strainer separately with the same finish for a complete coordinated look. Finishes have all held up perfectly and still look like new.",

I believe the addition of air integrated into the head allows for It to mimic rain falling.\n\nYes it\u2019s an expensive indulgence, however it\u2019s built very well and with occasional cleaning of hard water build up - I expect this to last for many years. It was also very easy to install. No extra or proprietary pipes needed. A little plumbers tape and screw the head on.\n\nThis product receives my highest rating and one of the best purchases I\u2019ve made on Amazon of all time.",

                "review_body": "I have been looking for a shower head like this since visiting New Orleans and using one in a boutique hotel.  We installed over $30,000 of Kohler products in our new home.  Our previous Kohler overhead shower head just emitted a steady stream of water that covered a six inch area when standing underneath it.  The Hansgrohe pours a steady soothing cascade of raindrops over a foot wide.  I enjoy the light feeling of the rain drop-like water much more than the hard stream of the Kohler.  While the construction of this fixture is just a step below that of the Kohler it is certainly attractive and I will have to wait to judge it's durability.  Our Kohler products are extremely well made and have held up great over the last ten years. I used the Grohe chrome extension to mount it and it matches perfectly.\n\nAs for the other review here I would suggest you check your water pressure because there is certainly no shortage of flow resulting from the fixture itself.  If you are considering this 12\" fixture I would suggest you read the reviews of the similar 10\" fixture here on Amazon to get a more accurate opinion of this fixture when properly installed with sufficient water supply and pressure.",

It has airflow intake at center and with this covered the hissing from air flow stops (quiet is better) but no improvement on increasing water flow. Contacted HansGrohe asking if green nipples could be removed and they advised not possible.\n\nIf your looking for very light water this one is perfect. If your after stronger rain or light water-fall feel keep looking. Fortunantly we have handheld shower which works well but wasted so much money on this and not able to return once used. Looks great but would be happy if flow rate was adjustable. If considering a rain shower head it would be best to stop in good plumbing store where they have working units on display....wish I did.",

                "review_body": "This showerhead really justifies the investment-grade price:\n\n--Design, materials, construction and finish are impeccable.\n--In use, it feels absolutely like you are showering in the rain. We attribute this to the combination of very effective aeration, which creates soft droplets, and the large area covered by the showerhead. A smaller head with the same aeration might have the soft droplets, but the total effect would not be the same.\n--The showerhead feels like it delivers a high volume of water, even though it's limited to 2.5 gpm. We thought flow would feel lower due to the large surface area yet have been pleasantly surprised by the sensation that we're getting a large volume of water. Again, likely a function of the aeration. We use a Grohe showerpipe system with adjustable flow and do not need to turn it to the max to get a satisfying volume of water.\n\nA couple of caveats:\n--If you prefer the feeling of a stream of water, this showerhead is likely not a good choice.\n--If you have ceiling lighting already in your shower, the showerhead may block some or all of the light. It's that large. Also, the mirror-like finish of the top surface will reflect light back on to your ceiling.  If you are building a shower with lighting and plan to use this head, double-check the positioning of your light(s) relative to position of the showerhead before you rough in the wiring.",

                "review_body": "Kingston Brass is one of the worst companys I've ever had the displeasure of working with!!!! I purchased one of their very high end, almost $400, kitchen faucets about a year ago. It arrived and I was very pleased. It seemed well made, heavy duty, excellent. It worked well until the hot water side started to leak. Ok, no problem, I'll replace the hot water cartridge. Simple enough. I ordered a new cartridge. Weeks later it arrived. Unfortunately they delivered the wrong one. No problem, annoying but mistakes happen. After finally getting someone to wake up in their warranty dept., I got the return authorization, and returned the cartridge. Now, instead of them automatically shipping the correct one, was told I had to go back on line and order a new one. I did. Days later they called to inform me that the one I needed was one backorder and, instead of them putting me on their backorder list, I would have to check with them periodically to see if they had received them. That was in early Feb. They weren't expecting any until mid-March. March turned into late April. In late April they had new stock and I was able to order my new cartridge. Finally it arrived. We'll have hot water in the kitchen again. I'm excited. Installed the new cartridge, turned on the water and........it drips worse than the one it was to replace. To make matters worse, they all but laughed when I finally reached them (it's almost impossible to get them to answer their phone). I was told to take a picture of the cartridge and email the warranty dept. That was week ago, and still no response. If you're still reading this, all I can say is find yourself another company. There's a reason no one has heard of KB. Spend your money on a name brand with customer service, not some half-assed, back street, boiler room, incompetent bunch of buffoons like Kingston Brass. Buyer beware!",

He was upset because it makes his work look sloppy. I agree everything else looks so nice even under the sink the plumbing was done so nice and neat but not the wire is there. I could not find if this product is safe to sell in CA due to the lead content. Lastly, the water pressure with the additional part on the spout is very poor I had to take it off to get enough pressure to rinse my kids toothbrush.

Luckily I saw the red o ring on the spigot and I knew this to be the hot spigot to the mounted on the left side.  If you are have installed faucets before this is likely to be no big deal.  On another note the parts diagram shows the faucet breakdown but identifies the parts by number only, there was no description. Also their warranty is not a lifetime warranty Moen is.\nHaving said all that it is a beautiful faucet you cannot go wrong there",

This will just stop tightening if you over-tighten, as it should be. Although it doesn't specify it in the instructions, I used teflon tape around the shower pipe, around the nipple on the diverter valve for the showerhead, and installed it until it was quite tight.\n\nYou should install it as per the instructions on the package. If the valve starts to leak when you turn the water on, then take everything apart and use the teflon tape. Wrap the threads twice, and then re-install. The reason for this is that all pipes are not made equal, so you should err on the side of caution.\n\nAlso, I installed the hand shower holder at 3 O'clock, which should prevent the valve from loosening up, as it provides an automatic tightening whenever you remove and replace the hand shower onto the holder.\n\nWith the water on, the valve feels smooth and you don't need a lot of force to use it. I'll post updates as time goes on about valve operation. But I think you will be pleased with the quality of this valve. And if you don't have a hand shower to use it with, you can always use it as a plumb bob because it's that heavy.",

These are extremely expensive fixtures.  I have the bridge faucet, the tub faucet and hand shower and the entire shower group (temperature valve, volume valves for the rainhead shower and the hand held shower).  Within about 2 weeks, the fixtures in the shower began to tarnish.  Within two months, they looked like tarnished silver with water spots.  I tried to clean and polish them with the suggested polish (Simichrome), but it made a HUGE mess and nearly ruined the tiles in the shower.  It also did not work very well.  Upon contacting Rohl, I was told to wash the fixtures with dilute dish soap and immediately dry after EVERY USE!  So ridiculous!  The sink and tub fixtures look better, but they are not constantly exposed to water.  The sink drain looks like old aluminum, due to the effects of toothpaste.  I was told that there is no defect in the finish.  Seems that it will look great in a showroom, but don't use it or expose to water unless you have a full time staff to take care of it.  Bad product and a very bad company, customer service wise.",

Surely, these cost more, but if you want something you won't have to replace--or have to replace washers and so forth--this is your item.  As with many items--it's pay me now, or pay me later.\n\nWe installed these ourselves and were amazed with the quality.  They are heavy with wonderful built in O-rings to prevent any possible leaks.  Logical.  The style went beautifully with our remodel and keeping with the year the home was built.  These are classical, beautiful, easy to install, heavy and high quality.

                "review_body": "Wow, this thing is an elephant trunk. I was aware of the dimensions when I ordered it, but it's something to behold once it lands on the doorstep.\n\nAnd that's the thing with Kohler -- some of their stuff is relatively run-of-the-mill, like their hollow, stainless spout I'm replacing (didn't match my chromed-out scheme, oops). It's almost a shame to have to permanently attach this spout to the wall, because never again will anybody using it be able to appreciate the sheer gravitas of the solid brass construction (save for the plastic aerator in the tip). It's quite the piece of art.\n\nInside the back end are the options for a slip-fit onto a 1/2\" copper pipe, or a more conventional threaded connection to I/2\" brass. The slip fit connection provides quite a bit of installation leeway in determining the length of copper pipe protruding from the finished wall. The threaded connection provides a stronger connecting piece, with a little more headache in determining what length nipple to purchase, but preserves some flexibility in swapping out a different threaded connection down the road without tearing into the wall (though I think that's maybe an unlikely scenario?). Either connection should be fine; I went with threaded, but the slip fit would truly have been just fine for me if I hadn't already installed a threaded elbow.\n\nThe threads, by the way, are not machined in to the spout. Instead, they're part of a bracket that is slid into the backside, and affixed at three points with screws. The bracket, and therefore the threads, can be rotated into three positions, meaning it's quite easy to ensure the threaded connection is tight enough and the spout is oriented correctly (sometimes you'll reach full tightness but the spigot will be pointing straight up, or off to the left).\n\nWith the spout mounted, it's quite unique looking compared to your average Joe bath spout, but short of using it as a step to access an overhead storage compartment, I don't think its solid brass construction will every be appreciated by anyone other than those handling it prior to installation. And so goes the life of monumentally unappreciated bathroom fixture.",

However, you must measure the clearance it requires (about 3 inches) for its lever handle.

Once you get by the non user friendly installation directions the installation wasn't all that bad.  Just take your time so that you know you are doing it correctly the first time around.  Once it was installed you can really see what makes Grohe so good.  The components glide smoothly and the features are awesome.  Like the gliding faucet.  Real nice feature!  The finish on it is also top notch.  Easy to clean and leaves no water spots.  Grohe is the star of my bathroom!",

Yes, some of them are, like make sure the water lines are not twisted, pinched, or bent at very tight angles, but would it have hurt anything to include a short text blurb?\n\nFor step 1, there is 1a, 1b, 1c. 1a and 1b look like they pertain to the optional metal plate at the base of the faucet. But is 1c optional? Then there's 2a and 2b. If I chose to keep the metal base plate (1a), do I only do 2a? The problem is that the diagrams show the top pull",

                "review_body": "This fixture is awesome.  I wanted a tall faucet because I frequently wash my hair in the sink, and this one works beautifully.  It looks super handsome with the gleaming starlight chrome finish, clean lines, and a very modern style.  The ability to swivel the faucet head right or left adds to the versatility.  The quality level is excellent too, and I expect this well-made piece to last.  Unfortunately there are a few things that keep it from perfection.  First, the lever on the back of the faucet for raising and lowering the pop-up drain looks surprisingly chintzy.  I realize you don't really see it all the time, but it doesn't match the rest of the fixture in finish or looks.  Second and more importantly, the installation manual is not good at all.  It covers two faucets with different designs, so you're continually having to determine which pictures to try to follow.  The pictures themselves - there is no text or written instructions - are hardly better than technical parts diagrams and should be better considering that this is a $250+ fixture.  Grohe has a few install videos online but they're not product specific and weren't helpful for my faucet.  My install was further complicated by the fact that I put this single hole fixture on a vanity made for a 3 hole fixture.  No problem, as I ordered an escutcheon plate from Grohe that covers the two unused holes.  Unfortunately the plate didn't come with instructions at all, despite having multiple pieces that need to be installed in the proper order which isn't self-evident.  Then I discovered that the metal pipe tube at the base of the faucet and which must go through the counter top was bigger than the hole in my vanity.  I was able to grind the hole bigger but only after a trip to Lowes to buy a special rasping bit for my drill.  A very long review to say that the faucet is fantastic, but installing it wasn't.  Please improve your instructions, Grohe!",

BTW forget about any customer support from GROHE, that's not happening.\n  So in a nutshell, if you happen to read this before ordering I can save you a headache by letting you know that they have instructions (generic) for two DIFFERENT faucets (*other one is: GROHE 33170003 Plus Single-Handle Bathroom Faucet S-Size, Starlight Chrome ) in the one pamphlet, yeah wasn't that swell??\n  I really don't think this is worth this price unless you need it to complete your bathroom look with another of their bath shower fixtures that coordinate with this. We were mixing and matching, the coordinating shower fixture was about double this price and didn't even include a tub water spout. I am still so aggravated about the bad directions and lack of support I don't think I will ever get another GROHE fixture again. Wish I could find some made in the USA products!

This gives it visual interest while keeping it from feeling too bulky nor too thin.\nThe curved areas lend a softer feel to what otherwise would have been a hard metallic angular design.\nEven the drain pull adds its own distinctive element with it's small cylindrical shape.\nThe build quality is as usual for Grohe, second to none. Silky smooth valves that are quiet with great precision.\nA uniform and flawless finish. Easy to keep clean and beautiful to look at. This one is when paired with the right design elements can make a statement. One of my favorite faucets by Grohe. 5 stars.",

I'll never go back to any other brand now, I'm a Grohe convert!\nThe finish on these truly is exceptional- sure, it looks like chrome like all of them but it's different. It cleans perfectly and easily and has a depth to the shine that the other brands can't pull off. It's hard to describe, but you'll notice it instantly.\nThe build quality of this faucet is fantastic as well. It's really heavy and solid. The way all the parts move is smooth and firm. There's no mistaking that this is very high end in every way. This particular faucet has a rotating feature which is unusual for a bathroom fixture but I love that feature. With the height and rotation feature, it makes for a more versatile sink. My master bathroom is being renovated now, with the floors being done this week and all the plumbing next week- including a complete Grohe makeover with shower controls, towel racks and everything all matching. You just can't beat this stuff- and I anticipate it will last forever.",

                "review_body": "The Grohe Single handle bathroom faucet is a feast for the eyes \u2013 although the style should be compatible with other fixtures in your bathroom. It\u2019s modern, fairly angular, and might not look right in your bathroom.  This faucet is designed as a one hole installation \u2013 I bought a Grohe plate to cover the two holes in my sink that would otherwise have been uncovered. (Since then, I\u2019ve removed and re-installed it without the plate, putting a soap dispenser in one hole and a faucet for purified water in the other hole).\nWith that warning, let me say that this faucet has features that few others (aside from Grohe) provide \u2013 the faucet swivels \u2013 if you want to direct the water anywhere from either side of your sink, to the center of the sink, this will do it. Why would you want this? There are times when you might get things on a side of the sink, and not want to put your hands into the sink to move it \u2013 think toothpaste, for example. This faucet takes care of that right away.\nTemperature settings limit how hot the water will become \u2013 you don\u2019t have to worry about getting burned by hot water when you use this faucet.\nThe faucet has a feature that is disappearing from many made by other manufacturers \u2013 a pop-up that can be controlled by a lever on the faucet, instead of a pop-up that you must press to open or close. I prefer being able to open and close the pop-up using a lever, rather than putting my hand into hot, soapy water to open the pop-up.\nIn addition to having great features, the chrome finish on this faucet is probably the best that I\u2019ve seen on plumbing fixtures.\nIt\u2019s expensive. It\u2019s got a style that you either can\u2019t use \u2013 or you can. It can cost you a LOT of money \u2013 because you may want to upgrade your vanity or the rest of your bathroom to do this faucet justice.\n\nI'm deducting a star because the installation instructions are too generic, covering many of Grohe's faucet models, and providing little specific guidance for THIS faucet. I've installed many faucets, so this wasn't a major problem, but I can see how it can provide a challenge for a person with little experience installing faucets.",

The internal solid brass and occasional peripheral high impact or composite support seem the same across the full product range. The Grohe ceramic cartridge moving-part is the best in class from my perspective.\n\nGrohe \u201cSilkMove\u201d delivers a best in class water temperature mix across water volumes. It is a premium mixer available in top faucets from Grohe.\n\nI install a lot of plumbing fixtures across the range of product prices. It\u2019s a no brainer distinguishing among low-cost, quality, and premium fixtures. There does exist a category of very expensive super-premium that I infrequently install. Super-premium is twice to three times more costly than Grohe. Unless it\u2019s a specific external appearance you want to pay super-premium for, the super-premium\u2019s have the same premium innards as the Grohe.\n\nGrohe has been a consistently premium fixture in the quantities I\u2019ve installed. Once installed, Grohe doesn\u2019t fail to achieve appearance, fit, and function, and for years. I have had to replace the Grohe ceramic cartridge in homes that have super hard water. On installation, I do advise the client that the ceramic cartridge is subject to future replacement due to hard water calcification. Calcification is the destroyer of plumbing fixtures inside and out. A house full of 5-year-old calcified, crusty fixtures costs a whole lot more to maintain and replace than the upfront cost of home water conditioning.\n\nI can't speak to the step by step instructions some have cited as a problem. The dimensional data I need is spot on. Some Grohe's are new to the US market and this might be one where the translation from German might be improved and I'm only guessing.",

                "review_body": "My bathroom sink had been there for like 25 years. Still worked, but looking at it each day consciously reminded me that I should replace it. I finally got that chance when I was able to review this. I know my comparison chart is only one, but what I can vouch for is the great quality of Grohe faucets, and specifically this one.\n\nFirst of all, I got the shiny chrome-like finish, which was what my old faucet was. I didn't have a choice, but if you do, I would recommend you to get the brushed nickel finish if you don't like wiping down your faucet daily because you hate water spots. The shine looks great, until it doesn't, which will last you about a week at most if you're like me and love to splash water everywhere when you wash your hands and face. But nonetheless, the chrome version looks good when it's clean.\n\nI didn't want to touch installing it with a ten food pole, as I'm all thumbs when it comes to plumbing, so I had a professional friend did it for me. Hopefully you are less useless as I am and can do it within an hour, as it took the pro about 40 minutes to do mine. I couldn't see what he was doing really, as he had to lie on his back and really dig in there underneath the sink cabinet. Lord knows I can even see what's what and where's where, let alone know what to do with anything. However, once done, it works like a charm. The knob controls both the hot and cold water, and it's easy to turn and use - the mechanism is smooth and easy. The faucet raises about 7.5\" off the countertop, and provides almost 7\" of clearance room, so it you feel very comfortable using it and not have to worry about not having enough space to wash your hands or other things that you can fit under it. My old faucet kind of just juts out like a bridge, so the clearance room was very low and it was a bit annoying using it. Finally, the fit and finish is top-notch. It looks and feels like a luxury, premium faucet through and through. Grohe has an excellent reputation for their faucets, and this one is no exception.\n\nI know this is not a cheap faucet. My old one probably cost $50, so I can't really compare the two. But if you have the budget for it, you will not be disappointed. If my old one lasted 25 years, this one should outlive me.",

                "review_body": "I bought this faucet in March 2013.  For the first year, it worked great...no complaint and I would highly recommended at that time.  After the first year, I began to experience some minor problems such as the spout loosened and the water dripped very fast (I didn't measure the rate) and another minor problem that I can't describe.  My husband tightened the spout and the drips stopped plus he resolved the other problem for me.  The problems were insignificant and I would still recommend it.  We are going into our 4th year with the faucet and I am very unsatisfied with the faucet.  Here are the problems I have been experiencing since August, every time I turned on the hot water handle half way, the whole faucet shakes violently.  I can feel the vibration when my stomach touches the counter in front of the sink.  In the last two weeks, the shaking doesn't occur every time I turn on the hot water handle.  However, on several occasions, the hot water drips even when I turned it to the max.\n\nMy husband diagnosed the problem and said something is wrong on the hot water side.  Unfortunately, I can't remember exactly what he told me.  To get it fixed, we would have to get a plumber out.  Unless, the situation is critical I don't like to call people out because I don't like strangers in the house.  He said he can change the faucet so now I am looking into a new faucet.  The specialist in a home improvement store recommended me to call Moen first to see if the company try to make it right by us.  Will try to update later.",

The instructions show how these parts are to be used.  I contacted Moen support.  They told me they no longer include these parts.  My faucet was packed with outdated instructions.  Installing the faucet without these parts left the spout wobbling on its base.  The set screw that is supposed to fasten the base is poorly made and strips easily.  The plumber did his best, but with incorrect instructions and a product that was indifferently packaged by Moen, he did not stand a chance.  DO NOT BUY FROM MOEN!  They do not live up to their reputation.\n\nFebruary 28, 2017 update.  If I could give this faucet a rating below one star, I would.  Now, after only a little more than a year installed, the hot water valve leaks.",

                "review_body": "After 22 years installed our old kitchen faucet gave up the ghost.  It had been a really good faucet and had many features we liked, so I had hoped that it had remained in production for all of those years, but it hadn't, and I'm glad.  This new one is considerably better.\n\nOne of the challenges with something being in place for 22 years is that it doesn't often come out the way that it went in, as demonstrated in the second picture.  It's never a good day in plumbing when a hacksaw is required, but required (and effective) it was, but any hope of repairing the old faucet was squarely out the window at this point in time.\n\nOne of the features we really liked about the old faucet was the high arc of the spout, and the ability to swivel between the two basins in the sink we have, so any new faucet needed to have those same features.  It also needed to be a 3 hole installation.  I added a Water Nymph sprayer in place of the stock aerator to add some flexibility in directing the spray, I'll review it separately.\n\nAnother thing that 22 years allows for is for things to improve, and in today's world I know that's not always true.  For the most part products I buy for our house are either outrageously expensive to match the quality of the rest of the house, or just cheap (and not in the good way).\n\nThis Moen Faucet surprised me with its amazing high quality, (see all brass fittings in the third picture) and its fair price.  The improvement over the old faucet comes in terms of user serviceability, all of the parts for this are available separately, so if something goes wrong I can fix it, and installation.  The old faucet was a complex installation with several hoses and fittings running under the counter from each of the individual pieces (the two valves and the spout) to make them all work together.\n\nThis faucet has a solid brass valve body, adjoined with an undersink \"bridge\" made from copper,  with all of the items at the correct spacing.  The bridge was slightly bent when I opened the package, but the soft copper was easy to realign so that everything fit perfectly.\n\nWith the helping hands of my 13 year old son only needed to get the valves installed to the countertop, the installation was smooth and easy, and the result fantastic.\n\nI really like the tactile feel of a good valve operating properly, and this faucet has that in spades.  The valves provide the right resistance to feel subsatantial, but don't bind.  The same is true with the spout swivel.  Smooth and well engineered.\n\nThe faucet flows a good amount of water, making it useful in the kitchen, and it looks great.  It is highly recommended.",

And if (like me) your cartridge is installed with stripped screws, you probably won't be able to unscrew said cartridge and (like me), you'll probably end up throwing this in the trash.

                "review_body": "I bought this because of the reputation of the manufacturer.  I also thought that the pop up stopper control looked like it would be easier to deal with than the lever system on most pop ups.  This was a BIG MISTAKE.  After I got the faucet and drain installed, as soon as I attempted to hook up the pop up stopper the mechanism fell apart in to several tiny pieces.  It took me half an hour to figure out how to get all the pieces together in the proper sequence.  A VERY FRUSTRATING EXPERIENCE.  Even afer I managed to get it to work the stopper does not pop up sufficiently to allow maximum water flow.  Also the stopper mechanism that is attached to the drain is on there very tentatively and I'm sure it is only a matter of time before it falls off or gets knocked off by someone rummaging for something stored under the sink.  The threads on the mechanism are cheap plastic and do not hold well to the attaching point.  I was also not impressed with the build quality of this faucet.  It looks nice from above, but the supply hoses were very small in diameter and were almost impossible to keep from kinking when tightening the connecting nuts.  I'm not a plumber but I've installed many faucets before in kitchens and bathrooms and consider myself a fairly proficient DIY person.  Do yourself a favor and STAY AWAY from this product.",

The standard 7/16 or 1/2 inch nuts used to mount a faucet are replaced with large plastic/steel mounting nuts that are finger tightened instead of having to fight to use a small wrench or extra long socket while you are lying inside the cabinet on your back.

I appreciated that you can install the faucet without the need for plumber's putty. Some people don't like the quick connect for the pop-up but I find it much easier to install than the traditional pop-up which requires you to get underneath the sink and try to attach the pull to the drain. This system is much easier but you do have to be careful not to disturb the connection on the tail piece or it might come apart. Installed easily without leaks around the water supply or the drain.

Visual improvement over the early 90s model with missing/broken popup that I replaced. You have to remove your P trap to install the drain/popup. I broke the galvanized pipe of the old p trap (it corroded almost all the way through and I finished the job during the install) and had to make a hardware store run anyway for a new P-trap (I bought plastic). So maybe look at your P trap at the time of purchase and if it is looking old and corroded plan to replace it at the same time too. I'm sure Amazon sells those as well. ;-) I had a 1.25\" OD P trap.",

FYI: Moen faucets (which I also have) come with a rubber sealed base plate. Also it is a bit larger than it appears in the pictures so make sure you have enough room (counter/back-splash clearance) for your installation.\n\nOverall, this is a really nice faucet with a lifetime warranty.\n\nNote: If your drain installation is not correctly aligned (must be straight up & down), your drain stopper may not seal properly.",

This is a great feature, as in most cases, you wont need to do any messing around cutting supply hoses or make additional trips to the hardware store.\n\nAnother comment is just about the American Standard brand in general.  I tend to have better luck with American Standard than other big brands such as Moen.\n\nWhat I don't like is that \"fancy\" pop up valve design, and you can't convert it to a regular style either, as the hole in the faucet will not line up.  This affected me because I needed to use a \"non-overflow\" drain instead of the overflow style drain that came with the faucet, and now I am stuck without a pop-up.  I didn't bother to return, as I don't really use a pop-up that much anyway, and just wanted to get the 1/2 bath project over with.\n\nTwo more annoyances, and then I will pipe down.  The flat style handle is not as easy to grab to turn on quick as the faucet in my other bathroom, which sports the traditional style handle.  There's that, and this faucet seems to really show the water spots fast and obvious.  After a couple days use, this faucet is really ready for a wipe-down...",

The cons: you'll probably need a new drain pipe extender (not included) and instructions/parts on how to install if the center sink hole is too small. The second con happened to me. My fifty year old American Standard sink has three holes, but the middle one is 1/2 inch in diameter. Each water line is 3/8 inch and the drain cable is about a quarter inch; they can't all fit through that small hole. Here is how I installed this unit. (1) remove the drain cable from the faucet. Note that it is reverse threaded! (Thank you customer service). (2) Put this cable through the small center hole and reattach. (3) Put each water line through it's corresponding (large) hole and mount the faucet. (4) To secure the faucet with the wing nuts, get the largest PVC coupler  that when cut length wise will fit under your sink (my clearance was 2 inches; I just used some 1 1/2 PVC pipe I had laying around). (5) Drill a 3/8 inch hole in the split coupler and install on the threaded rods in the faucet allowing for the water lines to pass underneath. (6) Tighten using the wing nuts.",

The water supply lines for this faucet are permanently attached by the manufacturer and are not removable. The fittings on the ends will fit a standard water supply line but the ones in a mobile home are a different size so cannot be connected.  The installer was not able to complete the installation with this faucet so, with my approval,  he went to a local hardware store and bought a faucet that he was able to attach using the original supply lines. I had to pay an additional; charge of $75 for labor to complete the installation. I have returned the unused faucet to Amazon. Adapters for the supply line are available but the hardware store didn't have any.  They might be available from a store that has RV supplies.\n\nA further note:  The Amazon referred installer's charge was $98.95 plus an additional $75 labor for the extra time it took to install the faucet from the hardware store.  I previously bought a faucet from Amazon and had a local handyman install it.  His labor charge was $100 and he furnished the required adapters at no charge. So this installation cost me more than it would have if I had used the handyman again. Lesson learned !  I",

I gave it 4 stars based on it's competition in the same entry level price range, not overall which would be a much lower score. It's of better quality than a Moen Chateau or any entry level Delta faucet. I'd rate this about as good as a Kohler Coralais. Having said that none of these top brand faucet bodies are made out of brass or even diecast metal but plastic as are all basic faucets. You have to spend more to get something that is even made out of low quality diecast(which disintegrates over time when exposed to water). If you want a brass(the best time proven material) body faucet then you'll be spending top dollar on the most expensive faucets these days. Unfortunately, only the internal water channels are made out of brass on cheaper faucets.\nThis faucet features a plastic body, diecast handle, brass water channel, plastic mounting nuts, and flexible hoses.\nThe best feature is obviously the braided stainless hoses. To put it in perspective, Delta uses very stiff and overly long solid plastic hoses on even their higher level faucets.\nThe weakest features are the plastic and diecast main parts and the poorly made mounting nuts. The nuts consist of a 1/4\" regular steel small nut encased in round plastic. They do not allow to be tightened very well since you can't really put a basin wrench on them to get them secured sufficiently. The are made to hand tighten only.\nOverall, it's better than most basic faucets under $100 but you're not getting anything to brag about here. If you want something to last for decades this isn't it. You'll have to spend $200 or more to get something that has a shot at lasting these days. Oil rubbed bronze, satin or polished nickel, etc will always cost significantly more for a real quality faucet.",

                "review_body": "I installed this faucet 6 months ago and the chrome finish still shines up well. The price is good, although I notice the Amazon price has increased since a March, 2020 when I bought it. The installation is easy because of the built-in water supply hoses (see comments below). The pressure washer secures the drain well without needing plumbers putty and the drain plug installation is simple (see comments).\nCons: if your water supply valves are on the floor like mine you\u2019ll need extensions as others have mentioned. The pre-installed supply hoses will only reach if the supply valves come out of the wall. This was annoying because all they had to do was make them about 6 inches longer. So it took a trip to the hardware store to buy the supply hose extensions. Also the drain plug doesn\u2019t always go down by pulling the handle. Sometimes  I have to push it down. It does come up though using the handle. The single handle works smoothly turning the water on and off, but stiff if turning from side to side to adjust hot/cold.\nI still rated the faucet 4-star because it looks good and does the job pretty well for the price.\n\nSome comments after 8 mos. use:\nIf you want to remove the stopper (to clean hair out of the drain) without having to remove the plunger assembly, install in the \u201cunlocked\u201d position. The \u201clocked\u201d position would be useful only if you don\u2019t want your kids to pull out the stopper and shove a toy down the drain!",

For me the whole point of satin nickel was to reduce the visibility of water spots, compared to a chrome finish.  That's not the case, this satin finish spots easily and now people don't think it's a new faucet, after a couple of days of use.  Sure, I could wipe it down with a clean paper towel after each use, but I wanted something that would not spot as easily to begin with.  Other than that, it's a high quality product, very easy to install.  Larger and bulkier looking than I imagined, it probably won't go well with a small sink.

The flexible water lines were very convenient but the best feature was the unique \"speed connect\" drain.  There isn't any need to use plumbers putty to install the included drain body to the existing drain outlet because it has a foam gasket that works like it is supposed to.  The additional feature is the cable connector that allows you to hook up to the pop up drain so that I now have a sink stopper that actually works.  The pop up sink stopper was always a source of leaks for me so, to avoid the frustration in the past, I often did not connect the lift knob on the top of the faucet and resorted to operating the sink stopper manually. This meant I really didn't have a functional stopper if I wanted to fill the sink with water.  Thank you, American Standard!  I wish there had been a choice of brass or bronze finish but the brushed nickel is still attractive.  I will purchase another for my other sink.",

                "review_body": "and looks too big on my tiny vanity that's in a tiny bathroom. It's probably (personal taste here - don't be insulted!) one of the ugliest faucets I've ever purchased. I bought it because I love the speed connect drain/pop up and I have to have the nickel finish. I installed a  different style years ago in the house I moved out of and knew I wanted another one for this bathroom.  I wanted a single handle control knob and had a hard time finding a speed connect drain with a single handle.\nI settled for this design and truly regret it. It's ugly. IMO\nI intended to install this myself and had the entire old faucet out except for the final piece - the cold water supply line wouldn't budge so I had to call a plumber. Grrr.\nTwo young plumbers, who didn't bother to read the installation guide, installed the drain completely wrong and insisted the issue with the pop up not working was because of American Standard QC. ??\nAfter they left, I looked at their install and the drain was installed so the pop up cable was on the right side instead of facing the rear of the sink. So I pulled out my wrench, loosened the drain, twisted it to where it was supposed to be - facing the rear - removed the cam cover and cam, turned the pop up to the \"unlocked\"  position, put the cam in turning completely clockwise until it couldn't turn anymore, reinstalled the cam cover and screwed the pop up cable on and low and behold!!! the pop up works PERFECTLY and I can remove it for cleaning. American Standard QC is just fine. It helps to read instructions! Swallow your pride and just read them. Seriously.\nThe faucet is heavy duty. All metal. And functions perfectly. I just don't like the style so I'm on the hunt for another single handle speed connect nickel finish faucet. It will be an easy swap since the drain is already installed.\nI do think this has a more masculine feel with the chunky size and would look better in a man's/boy's bathroom or even a laundry room where only you see it.\nIt's great quality if you like the style.",

Comes with the drain and popup controlled with a newer style cable.  Never had one of these before so I hope it holds up as well as the lever type.  Got this installed and looks good. It is a big faucet compared to most others so I would consider the size if you are not installing in a large sink/vanity area.  Reading other reviews I would recommend only hand tightening the water line hook ups.  If that is not tight enough, quarter turns with a wrench, bit by bit to seal the fitting.  You don\u2019t need much to tighten them.  Also, the tailpiece is 4\u201d, I had to buy a 6\u201d tube.  No biggie but check what you need.",

This was the easiest facet install I have ever done.  The color and finish was quite nice.  There was a seam on the underside of the water supply projection, but it was hardly noticeable.  In order to make a faucet like this at a price that is reasonable, there will be seams to install the parts the faucet is made from.  I like the ease of function this faucet provides.  You can tell  this faucet was made from metal not vinyl.  I have a sink that is not very deep from back to front, so I could not get an over sized faucet that would spray to fare out and would not look to large for the install.  Although this faucet is larger than the one it replaced, the soft lines and great design do not overpower the sink and is pleasing to look at.

                "review_body": "This is an excellent faucet that is really easy to install. I bought 3 (satin nickel versions) to replace all the faucets in my bathrooms and they all went in without a hitch (well, except for me accidentally detaching one of the sinks from the countertop when I tried to remove the old faucet). The drain setup has to be the easiest thing ever. I was worried that it would leak since they said it didn't need any putty, but the foam \"washer\" and tightening it appropriately has led to zero leaks and quick installation. The stopper itself was also unexpectedly easy. There's no manipulating of the rod and screws to make sure everything lines up properly. You just screw in the adapter on the back and you're done.\n\nThe faucet looks great and when it gets a little dirty, I just splash some water up on it and wipe it down with my wet palm. I haven't seen an unexpected amount of water spots (we have extremely hard water and no room for a water softener), and any that do show up are easily washed down using the method I just mentioned. I never dry the faucet unless I'm doing an in-depth cleaning of the bathroom, but certainly not for normal use.\n\nMy only complaint with this faucet is it can be quite noisy when running at a lower pressure. If I only turn on the faucet half way, it has quite a whine in addition to the sound of the water coming out. Once I open it up all the way, the whine goes away. This happens on all 3 of these faucets, so I imagine it is something inherent in the product. However, this minor annoyance isn't enough for me to mark this down. If I had additional faucets in the house, I wouldn't hesitate to buy this again.",

The black band, silver case, white face and uncluttered display are very pleasing to the eye.  I found the BM clasp a bit fiddly at first, but now I have adapted and enjoy the flat buckle fit.  Although I didn't realise it at the time of purchase, it has a 24 hour subdial, with a secondary time zone hand - an unexpected bonus.  Very happy indeed.",

I did so because they added one year to the warranty and do all of the repairs and maintenance (if needed) on site.  In addition, they did give me a nice reduction in price, which I have found is not unusual for upscale watches.  Okay, it isn't as good a price as I could get on line, but this is not a gray market watch and comes with a full U.S. warranty.  Often, the discounted watches are gray market and do not come with an American warranty.  I looked at other watches, including one by Tag Heuer and also Mont Blanc.  But when I saw them in person, I found that they looked like very expensive sports watches.  To be sure, they were very fine looking.  But for me I find that the Baume & Mercier looks more elegant.  This is a watch that I will not wear daily (I am very active in the high Rockies ... wearing a Baume & Mercier while backcountry skiing at 12,000 ft altitude is sort of over the top).  I have recently purchased a watch winder so that the watch will not loose time while it sits in its case.  This has been a great purchase, looks wonderful, and is a great anniversary gift for me!",

                "review_body": "This is a really spectacular watch.  I wore a Submariner no date for years, and it was a great watch, but I didn't like the newly updated version with the ceramic dial (a nice upgrade) and the bulging body (blingy and unbecoming for a Rolex). This watch combines the best attributes of both Submariners (a classic design with a nearly indestructible ceramic bezel), with Omega's terrific co-axial caliber 8400 movement, which keeps time as well or better than any watch I've owned. The photos do not capture how well the polished links and bezel elements pick up the light and contrast with the matte black bezel with vintage style lume (though do be prepared to wipe it regularly, the mirror like finish does pick up finger prints quickly).  And if you don't want to deal with fingerprints, it also looks great and understated on a NATO, as seen in James Bond Spectre.  It's just an overall stunning watch in person that immediately displaced the rest of my collection as my daily wearer, and yes, it will go SCUBA diving with me soon enough.\n\nI can say I would take this without hesitation over the new SubC and it has (at least for now) relegated my older Sub to the closet. The Jaeger Tribute to Deepsea and Blancpain Fifty Fathoms are very similar looking; they obviously have a rarity factor that the Omega doesn't, but I'm not sure they're better watches, espeiclaly when you look at things like the 8400s unique co-axial technology and 15,000 gauss anti-magnetic protection. Throw in a not insignificant price difference and it was an easy call for me.\n\nHighly recommended.",

The watch is of a timeless design and is of very high quality and build. The Swiss ETA movement is the finest such Quartz movement available today and the case is equal in quality to most all of the finest Swiss manufacturers. The face of the watch is a perfect size and the Genuine Crocodile Leather Strap is elegant and a keeper. Considering the watch is being sold today at 55% off list price; this represents one of the best values out there. A similiar Baume Mercier or Oris Watch would run about $1,300 to $3,500. The overall look and quality is better than similiar Tissot Classics especially the movement itself. This Raymond Weil has an inspired look of a Patek Phillippe yet retains the elegant casual look of a Baume Mercier Watch. Amazing looks, great value and a great addition to any collection!!!",

I hesitated by sending it back due to the timing that I received it and decided not to. I will give him the option later. The quality of the watch is unmatched. It also came with a note from the seller \"I hope you enjoy\"!! The band is genuine leather and very durable. Overall I like it a lot and I hope he will be pleased a well.

However I started running into problems about two months in when it stopped ticking while still on my wrist, suggesting that the self winding movement was going through some problems. However this eventually went away and I thought it some sort of clockwork hiccup. About 4 days before the return deadline it completely stopped functioning; no amount of winding, or moral encouragements could get it to tick again. I didn't spend close to a grand for a lackadaisical watch, although I suppose that could add some character. Whether this is Amazon's handling/QA fault or Raymond Weil's is the question. Either way, my refund was not processed because while I dropped it off at UPS 2 days prior to the cut off, it didn't arrive until a couple of days later so buyers beware.",

This comes from spending 2 years in watchmaking school, studying directly under the guidance of a certified master swiss watchmaker who came here from Europe.  Watches, especially mid to high grade swiss watches, are a passion of mine.  I am not loyal to a brand or a style or anything else.  I judge them for what they are, in terms of quality, function, construction, and style.  A watchmakers point of view.\n\nThis said I will tell you that this particular watch is what I consider to be a \"best kept secret\" sort of watch.  This is an AUTOMATIC watch (read: Mechanical - NOT Quartz), and of CHRONOMETER grade function.  Chronometer as used here is a measure of accurate timekeeping, not quality - a point often misunderstood - and is used mostly from a marketing point of view by companies such as Rolex.  HOWEVER.  This movement in THIS watch is actually EXCELLENT in terms of quality, time keeping ability, and construction - easily comparable to other Swiss made movements from other famous manufacturers costing several times as much.  This watch, properly serviced, will provide a lifetime of use - and probably more.  Absolutely the sort of watch you pass down to the next generation.\n\nAll in all - and EXCELLENT choice - especially for those seeking their first QUALITY Swiss watch purchase.\n\nDefinitely recommended!",

Reviews should be about the watch, seller reviews should be about the seller. Buying from a unauthorized dealer in Israel and have omega pay for it has nothing to do with the watch itself. Nor does a delivery not happening have anything to do with the watch.\n\nNow for a real review.\n\nThe attention to detail in this watch is on par with anything from a Automatic version of this watch. Only difference is the movement. Other than that they are the same. Being a person who owns a couple Rolex autos, omega autos, the fit and finish of this Aqua Terra and rivals\nAny of them. What you are getting here is a watch with the build quality Omega is known for.\n\nThe new Quartz versions of this watch are not made as well as this one here. They have painted on indices, not applied, painted logo not applied. Here is a fast fact. They are not making anymore of this version of the Aqua Terra with the same build quality as the autos. The new ones compared to the Autos are made to look cheaper. These are not.\n\nOmega is one of the top brand of watches in the world, period. Easily on par with Rolex, and in some cases surpasses them. Google a Rolex Sub vs a Sea-master and look at the comparisons. This watch is going to go up in value, since they don't make them anymore.\n\nThe watch face is 39.2 mm, compared to the newer models of 38.5mm. The movement in this is the Omega is the 1538 a rhodium plated 6 jewel movement. It has a independent hour hand setting for traveling which is convenient. I own a quartz Bond Sea-master and a 2016 Planet ocean auto. My seamaster with a 1538 quartz movement is accurate to 00.8 seconds a month! This is straight from Omega after a overhaul. My planet ocean isn't close to that and it has a Co-Axial 8500 movement which is considered by many as one of the most accurate on the planet, even surpasses the 3135 from a Rolex sub! Not that I am expecting a Auto to be as accurate as a quartz, since buying a Auto with the accuracy of a quartz isn't why a you buy a Auto. You buy a Auto for the craftsmanship and art of the movement. A quartz is bought for accuracy and convenience.\n\nThe band of the watch is superb, its sliding mechanism makes putting on and taking off the watch a breeze, the case is finely polished and the dial has the attention to detail which is expected of a Omega watch. The band is very comfortable and does not pinch the arm or gets uncomfortable after extended wear. My only gripe is that the clasp sliding mechanism could be a little shorter and it tends to make the weight of the watch a little uneven depending on where you have links removed. But hardly noticeable. Not a deal breaker by any means.\n\nOmega's customer service is second to none. When you go to a Omega Boutique they have a sitting area with Cappuccino, Espresso, and your snack of choice, cookie, shortbread etc. You get pampered and are shown respect. Any thing I asked them to do they did happily! Never in the 15 years of owning a Omega have I had a bad experience with them. Now am i saying they don't mess up. No. They do. Everyone does, but they make it right in the long run. It's how they tackle and fix problems, not the problems themselves. That is a true mark excellence in my opinion. I get treated better by Omega than by Rolex.\n\nNow is this a replacement for a Auto, no. It's not meant to be. But if you want a well made watch this is more accurate than any auto, has the build quality of Omega is known for and a customer experience to back it up. This Aqua Terra is a good choice.",

Watch was exchanged and after 3 weeks of usage same issue re-occured already on new  watch.\n I took this upto Omega and Local  official dealer and explained, that I expected something more durable and honest starting from buying and  throughout  usage of \"luxury\" product\nSolution from Omega? Take same watch 3rd time! For me twice was enough and I asked for some better solution and compensation for  my disappointment and dealer agreed to give me watch of ... TISSOT as a compensation. I was shocked and amused.\nAttempt to explain difference between Omega and Tissot buyers profile were fruitless. Official dealer did nto agree to upgrade my watch to another Omega one for unhonesty of their shop during purchase and product  bad quality.\nAt the end, after  3 months,  my purchase was refunded, watch returned  and I was granted to pick up complimentary SWATCH  watch for all the inconvenience  :-)\nOffical Omega? No response at all.\nSo for me and my family members Omega is the sign of bad quality, ugly customer support and not understanding their customer profile. My advice to collegues and friends - never buy Omega, especially in Israeli \"Impress\" shops and \"Roltime Ltd\" dealer.",

I prefer larger watches because I have large hands, but I'm not crazy about having a heavy item strapped to my wrist. --->Finally, Breitling has designed a watch perfect to my needs. It's a 45mm watch that wears more like a 44mm. It is titanium, which is substantially lighter than stainless steel, and has a 22mm canvas strap that tapers down to 20mm. It has a rubber inlay which keeps the watch from sliding up and down the wrist, holding it in one position throughout the day. I love it. I'll come back in 6 months to provide an update on the build quality of the strap, and give an honest opinion on my first, post honeymoon, Breitling experience.",

What came was a red faced watch with a small U on the face with the feather heading off to the side. They did correspond with me at the end of December (when it should have been already sent/received) letting me know that the watch I ordered was out of stock and gave me the option to upgrade or wait. I told them I would wait because I wanted the smaller faced watch than what was offered with the in-stock upgrade. The watch received today is a larger faced watch (bigger than 28mm). I love the simplicity of the watch shown. It looks nothing like this picture. But because my son already has waited far too long for this purchase, we will keep. However, we will more than likely never do business with these people again. =(",

I had a dressy type of UM logo watch but it was not appropriate for every occasion.\n\nMy biggest fear prior to ordering this watch was that the face and strap will be too small for a man.  I ordered another brand in the past and ended up giving it to my girlfriend because it was made more for either a woman's or child's wrist.\n\nThis one arrive in great shape and well packaged in a plastic case.  The face of the watch is still not as large as I prefer, but it is acceptable (I enjoy wearing large face sports watches).  The strap is a bit short for a male's wrist, but I ended up pulling the Velcro strap through the first opening of the fastener and it works just fine.  So far so good on quality and durability, and I've worn it to a couple of football games.\n\nThe biggest take-away is to give this watch second thoughts if you have a large wrist (unless you do not mind purchasing a new strap for it).  Otherwise it is a good buy at $27.  I will provide an update towards the end of the football season.\n\nGo Tigers!!",

It's a perfect size watch for medium wrist sizes. It's comfortable to wear and the crown does not get in the way of wrist motion. The crown has the GS logo. The GMT bezel is indeed bi-colored which does not appear in the stock photo but when you view it from PoV of your eyes it will refract the light such that you can tell the daylight half. It has an opencase back. It's a limited edition.",

There are hundreds of Stuhrling designs out there and reviews are overwhelming positive, especially on the skeleton watches. This is my son's second Stuhrling and his first (two years old now) is still in great condition. Note that he is a 17 year old and generally hard on his things. I'll update my review if after he receives the gift, we find any problems.",

The description boasts of fine Swiss design, Swiss quality, and produced with strict oversight by Swiss engineers, but the one tiny sticker I found which was the ONLY place anywhere that said where it was actually made...\"Made in China\". The leather band was horribly fake plastic looking, the metal feels cheap, and....this is the capper....the minute hand wasn't even attached!

Does not require a battery to run just need to ensure you wind it twice a day or so, I find i do it quite often now out of habit. A few complaints I have so far is the minute hand seems to fall behind every few days where I find myself resetting the time after it starts to fall behind a few minutes, I'm not sure if it's not counting seconds properly or what, I don't claim to be a watch expert.  While the band had a leather smell to it and still seems to be holding up so far, however the 2 straps that you tuck the excess band into do not seem to be made out of leather as I can already see a bit of wear on them and they definitely are not as shiny as the rest of the leather band. I don't wear it in the shower even though it's supposed to be water resistant just out of caution and the inner side of the band is more porous and has a slight odor with sweat after the 3 weeks of wear.  Unlike most other watches I have worm in my life this does not snag on my wrist hair like most metal watches do. The face and metal still show no visible scratches on the glass which makes me hope it's good quality.  Most watches I've ever owned usually have scratched faces after only owning for a week or so. I'll update in a few weeks.",

Blue, red and green. I was fortunate enough to see all 3 models in a Houston store. I also own the red. The green model is super kewl, but it is GREEN, GREEN, GREEN.\n\nI recommend this watch to everyone who wants a watch that is unique and different. However, I can only rate this watch at 4 stars because of the strap. It looks beautiful, but is stiff as plywood. I wore for a month, but still had to fight taking it on/off. Not kewl for this price.\n\nI ended up buying an alligator strap with deployment clasp off Ebay for $15 as a replacement. Now I wear both watches all the time.\n\nOne last comment. The Apocalypse series is the Epiphany Collection not Special Reserve. Check out the other Apocalypse models at sturhling.com. They are all awesome!",

Not using the recommended tools is a bit of a risk, but I was able to take a slat off of each side with not much frustration and thankfully no scratches.  The Ceramic Slats are way cool.  They aren't as smooth and glossy as the pictures show (thank God).  More like a black stainless steel.  They look kick-ass.  The bezel is fairly flat, but not nearly as flat as my old Movado Museum.  On some of the higher-ended Rados, they have the ultra flat, low profile bezel/crystal (that's the 'wow' factor I was talking about above that is missing somewhat with this watch).  The black on black with red highlights are what appealed most to me about this watch.  I grew up in the 80s when Swatches were the thing.  This to me, has that same kind of look but with more modern high tech components (Ceramic, Quartz and Sapphire Crystal).  I am interested to see how well it keeps time over a period of a few months.  That will be a big factor.  But for now, I'm happy after nearly a week.",

This watch is a perfect size, it\u2019s relation to Rolex is obvious. I am not a gold fan on wristwatches but the very subtle outlines of the dots and hands add some great sizzle to this piece. I own three black bays - one with the older ETA movement, and two with the new movement. If there is one thing I am not crazy about it\u2019s the riveted bracelet but apparently I am in the minority on this. The older versions have the bracelet with no rivets which I think is cleaner. Howeve of the three I won this one gets the most wear.\n\nThis is the best value for the price for any luxury timepiece out there. By a mile.",

But I had reached that point where you're just committed; you've made the decision in your mind and you're like, 'alright, I'm doing this' and you can't back down because if you go back on what you've decided in your mind, what kind of man are you? I mean, if you can't even stick to your own ideals, what can you stick to? So I had reached that point and realized that I didn't have the money. Well now it became a problem solving venture. I had to figure this out. I could sell the house, but then how could I keep my investment safe? I could sell my truck, but I gotta get to work to pay for the insurance on it. I could have sold my kids, but you know, future of the nation and all. So I finally settled on selling my wife. They are renewable resources as far as being able to find another and continue to do god's work. Luckily, I was able, through thrifty money wrangling, to make a decent profit, even after purchasing the watch. Now, the watch itself is a fine piece. The hands on the face a clear and easy to see. It keeps time well, although you do have to set in manually. The back is pretty neat; being able to see the workings and all. The band could use some improvement. The material is rather warm and the color isn't my cup of tea. If only my wife could have seen it. Oh well. I'm thinking of purchasing a second one to keep in a lock box. Oh, if anyone is interested, I have for sale a sturdy, hardworking personal assistant. He is about 13 and is capable of traveling at 8 mph and has a range of 80 miles on a single fill up. He is capable of lifting almost 130 lbs, but that can pushed to 160 lbs with the use of included cattle prod. If interested, feel free to contact my sales agent.",

And to make matters worse, the crystal on the face has an unusually elevated, dome-like shape to it, which looks awkward and also distorts your view of the face when looking from certain angles. Not a terrible watch, but the bracelet doesn't justify buying a watch with a face like this. I guess you could say this watch is a butterface. Heyo.",

The watch is beautiful, when you can see it. The numbers disappear when not in bright light. It is not comfortable to wear and is the heaviest watch I own. For reference my Tag Heuer  F-1 auto chrono is the most comfortable bracelet watch I own. The Breitling bezel seems thick and the dial seems small, given it's a 45mm width. The reason I have this is because I went for the Super Avenger chrono, but at 48mm it was WAAAAAY too big for my smaller wrist. There is no denying the quality you will get with an authentic Breitling. I do love this watch and have worn it a few times already. I have quite a few watches so it's more of a round-robin situation for me. The volcano black dial is very black, but not shiny. There is just enough red to add interest, but avoid fashion fatigue. The stencil like numerals give it a tougher look. The watch sits high above the wrist and is very thick.",

Now, on to the negative.  I researched this watch for hours on the internet before buying and seen very few negatives about the watch.  One of my main concerns was the quality of the crystal.  This watch (supposedly) has a Krysterna crystal which is one of the strongest crystals a watch can have.  They're supposed to be basically indestructible.  I've worn this watch almost everyday since owning and wear it to work and in casual settings.  This watch did NOT get abused in any way.  I noticed one day though that there was a scratch on the crystal.  I was furious, as I'm sure most would be.  So, I took it off and the next day I looked at the watch again and it had cracked the ENTIRE way through from side to side.  My watch now needs a replacement crystal, which I'm sure isn't cheap.  The crystal is NOT covered through the warranty.  Stuhrling claims to sell \"quality\" pieces but I beg to differ.  So, stay away from this watch, or at least buying through amazon (I now question if the watch was authentic).",

They have:\n\n- Ruthlessly basic quartz movement\n- Very little heft\n- Very little in the way of build quality\n- Very little in the way of features\n\nWhen you actually hold them in your hand and examine them, they compare equally to unbranded/generic Wal-Mart/Target watches in the $20-$30 retail range. I certainly wouldn't pay more than that for this watch.\n\nAnd frankly, you'll get a far better watch spending $30-$40 on a Timex, which while basic and meant to be, is built to a generally higher quality level. Do not pay MSRP on these for any reason ($300 range is laughable) and do not even pay the Amazon price without handling one first, as you're likely to imagine that you're getting more for it than you actually are.",

The movement has been so perfect with timekeeping (i am not sure about seconds gained/lost).\nI've been getting lot of compliments when i started using it. And so i've given 5star rating",

The craftsmanship seems pretty good, but not quite as good as a Skagen, which is what this reminds me of. The clasp was hard to adjust but once I got it set it seems fine. Hoping it'll hold up, but so far, normal wear hasn't caused any scratches or damages to the band or crystal. Overall, happy with the purchase!",

I don't understand what people are expecting from this dark-themed watch. It is all black, from the case to the minute and second hands. The picture tells, everybody. Look at the picture. If you don't want a watch that you can't see under decent light source, so do not buy it. It is not for you. But because of this design, this watch looks very cool and minimalist. Very. I still get compliments to the watch. It is a two-in-one, decent watch and wrist band. I would give this 4 stars because the case is brushed metal and I wear it upside down of my arm, so the corners and metal around the face got a little worn-off as I rub my arm to table and different surfaces. I wish it was painted well enough to hold its color a little longer. Other than that, I am very satisfied with this purchase and thinking about getting the winston royale silver one.",

                "review_body": "This watch is beautiful. I've been looking for a green face watch, and although I saw this first, I actually bought an MK watch. But due to an incident the watch did not come and I ended up buying this one. At first, I was surprised by how big it was as I have really skinny wrists (it says it is unisex), but everyone loved it on me and I grew to love it! The green is beautiful and so is the gold (although at times it looks like a fake gold to me, but I don't care so much). The only gripe I have is the latch to undo the watch. After constantly readjusting the watch to fit my wrist, putting the watch on, then removing the watch, my fingers stated to hurt since it's kinda tough to undo. That's probably a good thing though, as you know it won't unlatched itself easily. But man...my fingers hurt. I love the size now, but I might have loved it even more if the face was a bit smaller.",

I shopped for weeks looking for something in my price range with all the correct features.\n\nThis watch caught my eye because of the color and I appreciated the concept of the hybrid electromechanical drive. As an engineer, time accuracy is important. I didn't want a strictly automatic engine because of the annoying minor time drift most suffer from. Adjusting the watch becomes more of a hobby than it needs to be and I am sure I would obsess about it.\n\nThis watch is substantial. It has the nice, heavy feel I enjoy having on my wrist. The band is wonderful. I looked at a few Breitling watches, but the bands turned me off because of the way they tear arm hair out. The Tag Heuer band does not. It's bright and shiny and reflects light in a most enjoyable way.\n\nI will likely use the chronograph features of this watch only a few times a year. Unlike a lot of chronographs, the timer functions on this watch are unobtrusive. (It uses the clock hands for timing at the press of a button!)\n\nIt's a little tricky to set this watch up. It has \"modes\" of operation unlocked based on the position of the sweep hand and the crown stop. The calendar is perpetual. That's a welcome feature. You set it and forget it. No more being bothered by having to manually adjust the date at the end of months of less than 31 days. It's Leap Year aware as well.\n\nIf you are looking for a quality luxury watch at an affordable price point, you can't go wrong with a Tag Heuer like this one.",

                "review_body": "A short review of this watch:\n\nWeight:  It was not as heavy as I expected (even though it is quartz and I knew it would be lighter than an automatic), but it has a substantial quality to it. If you are new to the luxury watch market and are worried about getting used to the weight, this might be a good selection. For those that love a big heavy watch, this is probably too light for your taste, but like I said, still substantial.  I like a heavy watch, and while this is far from the heaviest that I own, I'm still pleased with it from this aspect.\n\nSize: With dimensions of 43mm and 13 mm, I again was surprised by the relative size. As with the weight, the size is substantial, but it's nowhere near the size of another 43mm and 13mm watch that I have. (yes, it measures the correct dimensions, but this watch is crafted in a way where it tapers from the middle to the top and bottom in a very stylish manner making it appear smaller than the dimensions would otherwise lead you to believe.) Again still substantial, and a good comprise between the understated nature of a Patek and the monsterous quality of a Breitling (and yes, much cheaper than either of those as well, but just an example for purposes of comparison).\n\nOverall on size, I think it's a good balance. I would not imagine any adult male complaining about the watch's size (too big or too small) after a week or so of wearing it.\n\nBracelet/Band:  Looks like the picture. This particular band has 2 additional flat surfaces on each shiny link (the shiny center link is squared at the top and the bottom) compared to other watches that i own/have seen. It catches the light more than your standard band of this style which I like.  At a glance it looks a little different than the more common type of this watch band where the center shiny links have rounded edges. Admittedly, this is a very subtle difference.\n\nPerpetual calendar: Had to read the manual to figure out how to change the time, date, year, but once you figure it out, it's very logical. There is even a \"cheat sheet\" engraved on the back of the watch to remind you when the season's change and you don't feel like digging up the manual. The perpetual calendar is a nice feature so you only have to set the date once (and then whenever the battery runs out.) The bottom half moon dials tell you the date in regular time mode.\n\nChronograph: This watch uses the main hands as its chronograph which makes it very easy to read.  A little different than most other chronographs so a nice change if you collect watches, or if you hate all of the dials on the face of the watch but still want a chronograph.\n\nRagatta function: This is basically a countdown mode. It uses the hour and minute hand moving together counting down on the hours markers from 10 to 0. The thought here is that you get 10 minutes to set your boats up in a boat race and this watch counts those 10 minutes down for you. There is also apparently an additional 5 minutes that you get in the race that the watch can also countdown.  In all likelihood a completely worthless feature from a functionality perspective for nearly everyone who buys this watch, but its something your boss's watch probably won't do, for what that's worth.\n\nOverall:  The only complaint that I have is the type of links this watch uses. They are nearly impossible to remove yourself without risking bending a pin. Take it to a watch store to get that taken care of. The watch itself is very nice, and for amazon's price, I think you're getting an extremely good deal. Own a lot of watches, and spent a great deal of time researching this purchase, and I'm very pleased.",

                "review_body": "This watch is different. There is no manual adjustments. Everything is electronic and runs off the battery. Even the crown doesn't move the hour and minute hands. It has dual motors in it that perform all the movements. Everything is set by pressing the buttons and the battery in this is larger, and harder to find than most as a result. I had to go to batteries+ to get it.\n\nThis watch is on the lighter side but still heavy enough to indicate that it is solid. The dial does not move. It is for this weird regatta countdown that only is useful for people who sail and participate in sailboat racing.\n\nI do like the feel of this watch. The latch is nice and tight. The bracelet is very sharp looking and shines quite well after every polish. This watch will not scream luxury - it is more casual.\n\nWhat I don't like about this watch is that it gets out of sync and gets misaligned often. This is a problem for many people. I bought this over ten years ago and sent it in twice to get realigned. Turns out there is a factory reset function that allows you to realign all the hands to the zero position. Again, all done electronically. As simple as that might be, it does take about ten to fifteen minutes to do it and set the time again.\n\nI would not buy this watch again, and I don't think they even sell it anymore. It is a unique concept but a watch that costs this much should not need to be re calibrated a few times a year. It appears that Tag Heuer tried too hard to make all of this electronic and the complication of how to set it, multiple countdown functions, perpetual calendar, etc. and it didn't work out perfectly.",

The packaging is very well equipped I knew my watch was not damaged on the way and what was super cool is they sent me a FREE band to interchange!  My favorite thing about these watches is the low cost but high end quality. The one thing that stood out to me was the sapphire face on all their watches (scratch proof!!) while my other brand watches that are more expensive do not have this feature. I also found out that all the bands with Jace watches are interchangeable giving me more options of a different look with my watches. They are also waterproof! I don't have to worry when washing my hands, taking a shower or even swimming for that matter lol. And to put the cherry on top it meant a lot to me to know that they are donating proceeds to charities around the world. I also had questions about all the details to the watches and their customer service was great with fast response, I even got to speak with the guy who created the line of watches himself!! You will not be disappointed.",

                "review_body": "I have always been a fan of Rado timepiece.  I also owned a few other Rado watches.  My wife bought me this item as a gift.\n\nChoosing a timepiece, like clothing, is something very personal.  To me, the design of this watch is just irresistably beautiful, and the finish is flawless.  It immediately attracts eyes of my friends and colleagues at work the first day I wore it.  While it is not the cheapest timepiece around, it is \"only\" 1/6th of the Rolex Daytona Chronography that I was drooling.\n\nThe materials used in this watch (mostly high-tech ceremic and sapphire) is so hard that even after wearing it for a few months, it is still like new.  Not a single scratch yet.  I also have a similarly priced and equally beautiful Tag Heuer Carrera Carlibre 16 Automatic, which I wear it the same way (for work and during the weekend).  It is not as scratch resistance as this one.\n\nThe material is also very skin-friendly.  I am allergic to nickel-ricked stainless steel watches which cause rashes.  This one if fine for me.  It is an alternative to leather strap.\n\nThis watch is 45mm in diameter and is quite big and heavy.  It is suitable for rugged use.\n\nThe display has a faint luminated effect.  It grows in the dark and you can read the time even light is off.\n\nIt is an automatch watch, and it relies on our wrist movement to power the watch; otherwise, manually winding the watch is required to prevent from depleting the power reserve.\n\nWhen it comes to time accuracy, I start it together with the Tag Heuer (which also uses movement from the Swatch group, same company as Rado) that I own and measured them my mobile phone.  This Rado seems to be consistently a bit quicker after just a week (e.g., 30 seconds ahead of my mobile phone time and 10 seconds ahead of Tag).  I was told that it is as accurate as a PP, VC, AP, ALS, Rolex, etc., which each is easily about 6 - 20 times the price of this watch.\n\nThe stopwatch function is as good as any other high-end chronography watches in the market.  Nothing special.  It is comparable to the Tag Heuer that i owned. Some people may said it makes the dial a bit too busy for easy reading of the time. It is a personal preference and a matter of getting use to.\n\nPros: -\n1.) Beautiful design and finish;\n2.) Afforadable/value for money;\n3.) Friendly to skin (the back of this watch is sapphire crystal and the bracelet are made of ceremic) if you are allergic to stainless steel watches;\n4.) Scratch resistance;\n5.) It has a faint luminated effect on the dial and can tell time even in the dark;\n\nCons:\n1.) Big and heavy (unlikely to be an issue for those who have a big wrist);\n2.) It is an \"automatic\" and requires constant movement of wrist to power the movement (or you need to manually wind it regularly or get a watch winder);\n3.) It is a chronography watch which the dial-display can be a bit too busy for some people to read;\n\nGo down to a Rado shop and hold it in your hands.  You will want to take it home.",

He is an engineer and loves how this watch works.\n\nIt keeps pretty accurate time when it is moving. If you take it off and don't wear it for awhile you will have to reset the time. But once it's moving its accurate within a minute. He did have to take it to a jeweler to remove the extra link. They have instructions on how to pop it out but it is much more difficult than it looks. It's easier to have someone who knows what they're doing take it out.\n\nA great buy for the price.

The small second dial on the front is  a nice touch. It would have been too plain without that. The crown is marked with the RW logo, as is the back. Nice leather band, marked with the logo, as is the buckle. This watch is a winner and I highly reccomend this brand. Ive  been buying watches for 40 years.

I'd go as far as to say this is my favorite watch in my collection. As another reviewer said, pictures do not do it justice. It's very refined looking and elegant in an understated way. It's is a large watch but not it's uncomfortably large or heavy. However, it is large enough to make buttoning the sleeves of some brands of dress shirts almost impossible (no problems with French cuffs though). Not really an issue for me,  I just pick a shirt that works with the watch.\n\nThe only thing I really didn't like about this watch was the band. I don't have a really large wrist but the stock band on this watch looked tiny and cheap. Not what I'd expect on a watch that supposedly retailed for $1,250.00. Perhaps I got a watch set up for a market other than the US, I'm not sure. However, I swapped it out for a Hadley Roma contrast stitch band and it completely transformed the watch. Made it super stunning! Issue solved but that's a one star deduct since I had to buy a band for a brand new watch.\n\nThe only real problem I've had in a year of ownership is with the durability of the inner works. The watch slipped off my bed and fell onto a rug that was on a hardwood floor. That two foot fall knocked the hands out of alignment and jarred something inside that made the watch completely stop. I took it to my jeweler and he got it working again but now it's randomly stopping so it's back at the jeweler again. Hopefully he can find the problem and get it resolved this time. Since I caused the  issue I'm not deducting any stars but buyers need to be aware that these watches are quite fragile.\n\nOverall, I love the watch and if this one can't be repaired I'll consider buying another. I'll just be a lot more careful with the replacement.",

He's very picky about watches and after losing his Rolex didn't really want to replace it with anything that didn't match up to his eclectic style. He actually guided my decision with the style of watch he was looking for. I ended up choosing this one for the watch band. It arrives in a long wooden box which makes it look suspended in the air, which was a really nice touch. The watch itself is beautiful. The internal workings are interesting and enchanting, and the colors really play well off each other. It's fun that you can wind the watch, but you don't even need to do that because it works off the movement of your hand. My husband has yet to let it unwind completely. It's waterproof, he's worn it in the pool without damaging it.\n\nThe only minor complaint is that when the watch isn't snug against his wrist, the ticking can get pretty loud. Nothing deafening, of course (it's only a watch), but you can hear it when you're next to him on the couch.\n\nThis is such an awesome watch that I'm hoping Rougois makes a more slender version with a bracelet strap for me!",

The older version of the watch was quite finicky and i had to send it to a watch repair shop in Boston twice. It is chinese made with a fancy sounding european name \"Roujois\". It is nontheless a chinese made watch. After i had the watch store in boston fully tear it apart ,clean all components and put back together i never had another problem with it....until i lost it. I loved the watch so much i bought another one. It has a nice rhythmic licking sound when you hold it up to your ear, you an hear all the gears ticking etc. A nice watch if it holds togeher. unfortunatey if it breaks the only option you have is to mail it a a true watch repair shop. you can not take it to any jewelry store to have htem fix it",

Perhaps a note of caveat would be that the Kristerna glass is not as hard and shock and scratch resistant as one would expect given the manufacturers description of it. That aside, St\u00fchrling makes very reliable, elegantly designed and sturdy watches at a comfortable price range.\n\nThis unit, however, beautiful as it is, broke the pattern. I just retuned it four days ago because the chrono second hand would not zero at noon. On a subjective note, it was hard to read at a glance in lighting conditions less than bright. It is for this reason I haven't yet decided to order a replacement.",

The dial is fantastic, I couldn't tell beforehand if it was white or silver, and in person it is much the same. With daylight directly on the dial it's obviously silver, but in other light it typically looks white, giving the dial a bit of intrigue. The movement is fully decorated, with every visible surface dressed in some type of finishing. The circular cotes de Geneve on the backplate are mesmerizing.\n\nI opted for the bracelet, which is the most comfortable bracelet I own due to the small links.\n\nThe finish of every surface is flawless, and dial can be viewed nearly sideways through the domed sapphire crystal without interference.\n\n100% happy with my purchase. Bought this for myself to commemorate my Bachelor's degree, and I feel the level of quality is absolutely up to pat for such an occasion.\n\n- Update 7/2016 -\nHave had the watch for a fee months now, it is keeping excellent time. I do keep it on a winder when not in use. Also bought a 21mm leather strap that compliments the watch nicely.",

I had to buy out of faith and I'm satisfied with my descision. The only thing I would say that is misleading about the advertising is that the watche's face or background (the poppy flowers) is slightly different on the watch than the picture. To be more specific the \"ZIZ\" logo in the photo is on the top right. On the actual watch it's on the top left, the flowers aren't the exact same as shown in the photo, and the hour markers in the photo are black dots with white centers. In reality they're just black dots. Overall it's a decent watch for the price you pay because the face isn't really important when buying a watch.",

The warranties on gray market watches come from the seller, not the manufacturer.  What you have to ask yourself is this:  Do I want to purchase a special, \"limited edition\" (10,007 watches were produced) that doesn't have a valid Omega warranty card with it?  This is not to say that there is anything at all wrong with the watch.  But Omega won't fix any problems with it.  And you are totally dependent upon the seller for service.  As for myself, if I were going to purchase a limited edition watch, I would want ALL of the paperwork to come with it, to include the original warranty cards.  I understand that purchasing a \"gray market\" watch can save you some money, but the savings may not always be worth it.  I've never purchased anything from this seller, and have nothing negative to state except that I don't think that a \"collectible watch\" that was purchased on the gray market is going to hold the same value as one with the original warranty card.  It's also a lot of money for a watch that no authorized Omega service center would work on.",

I bought a 19mm originally, and it didn't fit properly.\n\nIt's super minor, but that one extra millimeter of empty space was the only thing I could focus on whenever I looked down, and it pissed me off for weeks until I caved and bought another band. ??\n\nNeedless to say, amazing watch, and has done wonders for me.

It was a lovely watch with the perfect color combination. It came in the Lamborghini box with its own certified accessory and manual. I was very skeptical about it when I saw the picture, but the watch was beautiful. The dealer of the watch was also very very helpful when I called them about information, and he was very assuring about quality and genuinity. My husband loved the watch. Thank you for all the help.

I love the physical appearance of the watch, the bright orange bezel, the beautifully made dial and luminous Super-LumiNova applied to the indexes on the dials and hands which shows up nicely in the dark. My favourite part of the watch is it has a transparent sapphire crystal case back to see the co-axial 8500 movements which personally is a nice feature. It has automatic winding in both directions and has a Power reserve of about 60 hours which is great as I wear this watch most days! It looks nice on my wrist, feels great and is quite weighty. I have received a lot of compliments at work from customers and collegues since purchasing it.",

I have been wearing it every day and it's been very accurate, I did have omega regulate it to run +1 sec a day and it's been very precise. The quality is superb and feels very sturdy, pretty heavy but not too bad. There was a few things I didn't like at first but now I'm fine with them. The bracelet couldn't fit my wrist perfectly since there isn't a micro adjustable clasp. It was either too tight or too lose. I had to buy an extra half link from omega in order to get the right fitment. Now all is well. Second thing is, the anti reflective crystal can easily smudge but it looks amazing when it's clean. I also hear it the AR coating can scratch but mine has been okay so far. I have a tint scratch in the middle that is only visible with certai. Light/angles so it's not bothering me at all. Overall, great watch. Lived up to my expectations.",

This is not the first stuhrling watch I have purchased, and so far I haven\u2019t had problems with the quality. This watch arrived in a think orange sturhling box. It\u2019s padded to protect the watch during shipment and it makes for a nice presentation if you\u2019re giving the watch as a present. The watch face is also covered with plastic to protect it from scratching.\nI gave this to my boyfriend as a birthday present. He loves it and get\u2019s compliments on it every time he wears it. The look is so classy and I like watching all the components of the skeleton watch. Also, because the arms of the watch are blue they\u2019re very easy to see so you can read the time. I feel like if they were silver they would get lost on the watch face- so I think the color is a great touch.\n\nThis watch is an automatic watch, which means it doesn\u2019t have a battery and it needs to be wound. This watch is kinetic, so as you wear it throughout the day the watch automatically winds itself which is a neat feature. The downside of this is that if you let the watch sit for too long, it\u2019ll stop and you\u2019ll have to reset the watch.\n\nThe one thing I will say is that this watch face is on the large side and because the band is also metal it\u2019s a pretty heavy watch. The metal band is also big, we had to remove a few links for it to fit him well and he\u2019s a fairly large man. If you have small wrists I wouldn\u2019t recommend this watch, but otherwise it\u2019s fantastic.\n\nOverall I think this is a great product and it would make a fantastic gift. I\u2019m very happy I was able to purchase this watch at a promotional rate in exchange for my honest review.",

                "review_body": "Its a looker of a watch, and is extremely reliable.... when its working.\n\nPurchased in June, 2014 through a cruise line, and the one I got out of the box was defective.  It simply would not keep time correctly at all.  So when I got home, I called up Stuhrling customer service, and they were very nice and extremely helpful.  As long as you are within 90 days of purchase, Stuhrling will replace your watch, no questions asked, and will cover the full cost of shipping, so for those purchasing on Amazon, that is a very nice backup to have.\n\nThe replacement I got works very well, and keeps impressively accurate timing.  The only drawbacks I've seen are if you keep it in one position too long (especially if the face is horizontal) it will stop, so wearing it overnight sometimes will lead you to having to set the time in the morning.  However, for the most part it usually behaves extremely well, and does a good job in keeping itself wound through the course of the day.  The automatic ticking of it isn't too bad, and you rarely hear it during the day unless it catches your ear at the right angle, but it can be a little annoying at night if you don't have any white noise to drown it out.\n\nWith all that said, the one I got has a different face than the one shown here, despite being the same model.  The innards of mine are all silver, and not the Rose gold seen here.  I suspect this is an error in the photoshopping of the watches when showing the different colors available.\n\nIn the end, I absolutely love this watch, and recommend it to anyone.  I rarely go out and not get a compliment on it by those who see it.",

So, the company did not stand behind its warranty and charged a fortune for the repair.  As a pilot for many years I was excited to get my first Breitling.  Now I'm afraid to wear the watch for normal everyday use and will attempt to trade it in for a more durable timepiece (and will never purchase another Breitling).

One is the material of the bezel which is very sensitive and scratch very easily. I do care for my watches but it is surprising how easily can scratch. The other issue has to do with the accuracy. It is very fast on my wrist and slow on the auto winder. Of course it is a mechanical watch but 5-6 seconds a day is not what someone expect when buying a Breitling. My Omega Planet Ocean Big blue is more accurate. And even my Raymond Weil Freelancer is also very accurate, of approximately 0-1 sec per day. So careful when you decide to buy. Big caution to avoid scratches, although in the course of time inevitably several will occur.",

                "review_body": "If you are like me, then you enjoy researching big ticket items as much as the purchase.  I can't say that it eliminates buyer's regret but the hangover doesn't last nearly as long.  I purchased the Omega Planet Ocean 6 months ago with some trepidation because of the price and a bad experience that I once had with a Rolex.  I was concerned about the price because it cost considerably more than the Omega Seamaster.  The Seamaster is also a diver's watch and has a proven track record.  In fact, the watch that James Bond* wore in Casino Royale was a special edition quartz Seamaster. In this review, I will attempt to answer the following questions:\n\nIs it worth paying more money for a Planet Ocean, than for it's predecessor, the Seamaster?\n\nHow does the Planet Ocean stack up to more expensive competitor, Rolex Sea Dweller?\n\n*Note: James Bond wore the Planet Ocean in a Quantum of Solace.\n\nWhile conducting this review, I'll also try to educate the novice on the basic components of a watch: bezel, movement, band, crystal, case, and the face (dial, marker, hands).  Without understanding each of these components, you cannot accurately compare watches. Of course, there are other factors as well as intangibles to be taken into consideration (warranty, prestige, price, etc.).\n\n1.  The crystal is the transparent cover that allows one to view the time while protecting the face of the watch from damage.  The difference in quality and price varies according to the scratch resistance (hardness) of the crystal and the anti-reflective coating that have become standard on high end diver's watches.  Any watch costing more than $150 will generally have one of three crystals: Mineral, Sapphire, and Ceramic.  All Rolex and Omega watches come with Sapphire or Ceramic.  Ceramic (yttrium-stabilized zirconia) is the newest and most technologically advanced material.  For the sake of concision, the minor advantages of a ceramic bezel aren't worth the premium price at this time.\n\nThe Planet Ocean and all of the competing diving watches in this class come with sapphire crystal. Sapphire crystal is aptly named because it's literally a lab produced corundum. For those of you who are not gemologists, sapphires and rubies are fancy names for red and blue corundum!  Corundum has a 9 on the Mohs hardness scale (diamond = 10). Ergo, nothing below 9 on the Mohs hardness scale should easily scratch it.  I'm very hard on watches but still haven't managed to scratch the P.O.'s sapphire crystal.  The harder a substance, the more brittle it is, therefore, you're be just as likely to shatter a sapphire crystal than scratch it. If the crystal is raised (i.e. Sea Dweller), the exposed edge is also susceptible to being chipped.  Fortunately, this is not a problem with the Planet Ocean since the sapphire crystal sits flush with the stainless steel bezel (replaceable).\n\nBesides the way the sapphire crystals are mounted, the chief differences between diving watches involve the anti-reflective coating, or lack thereof. The Omega Seamaster and the Rolex Sea Dweller both put the anti-reflective coating on the inside of the crystal while the Planet Ocean has translucent blue tinted anti-reflective coating on both the outside and inside of the crystal. Note: You can only see the 'blue tint' by tilting the watch at an angle.  Before purchasing this watch, I read an amateur review from a Sea Dweller owner who stated that Omega made a mistake because the exterior anti-reflective coating leaves noticeable marks when scratched.  I've found that criticism to be highly exaggerated. In fact, I wear this watch daily and have put some scratches on the band but cannot find any marks on the coating.  If you are actually going to use this watch for it's intended purpose (scuba diving), then you will absolutely want to have this exterior coating because it works much better than the interior coating alone!  IMHO, I love the crystal's signature bluish hue because it's the simplest way to distinguish an authentic P.O. from a cheap forgery.\n\n2. Movement is the 'motor' of the watch that keeps the time, date, etc.  Each separate mechanical function of a watch is called a 'complication'.  With premium watches, you generally have three choices when it comes to movement: Quartz, winding, and automatic.  Quartz watches are more accurate and less expensive, but require batteries.  Question:  Why would anyone with half a brain want an automatic watch then?  Answer: Multiple reasons! While automatic and winding movements are less practical and generally require more maintenance over the long haul, the difference is the artistry, ingenuity, and elegance of a mechanical movement.  This is where the Omega Planet Ocean surpasses virtually every other watch out there including the Rolex Sea Dweller. The Caliber 2500 movement is based on an ETA 2892-2 (ETA is owned by the same company, Swatch group that owns Omega).  Several innovations make this 27 jewel movement extraordinary.  Due to the 'Co-Axial Displacement' the self winding (automatic) movement has managed to substantially reduce friction, thus requires much less lubrication than any other automatic movements manufactured today! What that means to you, my friend is that your new Planet Ocean watch will not require expensive servicing for 10 YEARS! FYI, that's twice as long as any Rolex. The drastically reduced friction within the movement also doubles the lifespan of the watch! Additionally, Caliber 2500 movement has been equipped with a 'free sprung balance' that's a 'state of the art' simplified regulating system which greatly improves the COSC timing precision.  In other words, this watch keeps exceptionally accurate time for a mechanical watch.  In my experience, this watch has kept almost perfect time +/- 1 second a day and under 2 seconds a week.  FYI: All mechanical watches tend to run fast by a few seconds per week during the first 6 to 18 months because of the initial factory lubrication. As the lubrication thins and spreads, high end mechanical watches generally become more accurate. Since the P.O. doesn't need as much lubrication, the accuracy out of the box is amazing.  It's the only mechanical watch that I've owned that's lived up to it's billing when it comes to keeping time.\n\n3.  Case:  The Omega Planet Ocean's case is beautiful, rugged, and well designed with twice the water resistance rating of the Seamaster at 600m/1200ft. While that's half of the water resistance of the Rolex Sea Dweller, it's a moot point since the diving depth record with a breathing apparatus is only 313m!  To give you a reference point, the most advanced atomic submarine (US Sea Wolf class) has a maximum diving depth of 500 meters.  Omega invented the helium release value that made watches better suited for longer deeper dives.  Without it, the pressure change upon returning to the surface would pop out the crystal. On the Planet Ocean, the release value is manual and looks like another winding clasp but is inscribed 'He' (the scientific symbol for helium). FYI- the safety value doesn't need to be deployed for normal swimming and diving.\n\nOh yeah, I almost forgot to mention the beautiful depiction of the Omega sea monster [hippokampoi] is on the case back.  Not only is it attractive, but it's the easiest way to determine if the watch is a genuine Planet Ocean.  While counterfeit watches don't seem to have trouble imitating the Rolex green hologram sticker, I've searched the internet and have never seen a convincing forgery of the Omega sea monster on the back case.  If you don't believe me, then go to the fake watch sites on the internet and do a comparison.  The counterfeiters know that most people who purchase counterfeit watches are only interested in fooling passive onlookers.\n\n4. On the Planet Ocean, the bezel is the black or orange 'coin edged' unidirectional rotating stainless steel ring that surrounds the crystal.  The Omega Planet Ocean's 'easy grip' bezel has 120 clicks (stopping points) stopping precisely on the markers.  FYI:  If you are diving with this watch, then the bezel is one of the most important features. For others who simply enjoy the styling and durability of a diving watch, the bezel provides a quick way to determine the quality, precision, and attention to detail that was put into the watch.\n\n5.  The band is the least important feature of a watch as far as I'm concerned.  The band can be changed and will probably be replaced long before the watch dies of natural causes.  Nevertheless, an expensive watch should come with a solid clasped high grade stainless steel, gold, or titanium band (I abhor leather and plastic).  The Omega Planet Ocean's band is first rate.  I found the it to be very comfortable and secure with no sharp edges. The clasping mechanism works flawlessly. Being that it is a diving watch, the clasp has a clever mechanism that painlessly extends the band to allow it to fit over a diving suit (or jacket sleeve). Fortunately, the band is brushed stainless steel so it doesn't show scratches like the polished case.\n\n6. Face (dial, marker, hands)-  The Planet Ocean's hands and makers are coated with Superluminova resin.  That means that when you turn out the lights, you do not have trouble making out the time for 30 minutes or so.  The arrow tipped hands distinguish the Planet Ocean from the Sea Master and the Ocean Dweller. Another cool feature is that you can distinguish the hands from one another even at 12:00! The date does not require magnification.  I've always felt that magnified dates aka cyclops interferes with the elegance of a watch. While this is a matter of personal preference, many people must agree since Rolex does not include the cyclops on the Sea Dweller.\n\nFinally, I must mention the size.  The Planet Ocean is a relatively big watch at 45.5mm and weighs 9oz.  I like bigger watches but it's a matter of taste.  I'm a large man (6'3\" 210lbs) so it fits me proportionally.  For someone with a smaller frame or thinner wrists, Omega makes a slightly diminutive version (42mm) of the standard PO.  Whichever version you choose, the Plane Ocean will never be mistaken for a lady's watch!\n\nCONCLUSION:  While the PO does cost more than the Seamaster, I believe that it's well worth the extra price because of the improved movement and styling. You are also paying $5000 less than the Sea Dweller. I love my Planet Ocean and highly recommend it.",

This comes from spending 2 years in watchmaking school, studying directly under the guidance of a certified master swiss watchmaker who came here from Europe.  Watches, especially mid to high grade swiss watches, are a passion of mine.  I am not loyal to a brand or a style or anything else.  I judge them for what they are, in terms of quality, function, construction, and style.  A watchmakers point of view.\n\nThis said I will tell you that this particular watch is what I consider to be a \"best kept secret\" sort of watch.  This is an AUTOMATIC watch (read: Mechanical - NOT Quartz), and of CHRONOMETER grade function.  Chronometer as used here is a measure of accurate timekeeping, not quality - a point often misunderstood - and is used mostly from a marketing point of view by companies such as Rolex.  HOWEVER.  This movement in THIS watch is actually EXCELLENT in terms of quality, time keeping ability, and construction - easily comparable to other Swiss made movements from other famous manufacturers costing several times as much.  This watch, properly serviced, will provide a lifetime of use - and probably more.  Absolutely the sort of watch you pass down to the next generation.\n\nAll in all - and EXCELLENT choice - especially for those seeking their first QUALITY Swiss watch purchase.\n\nDefinitely recommended!",

                "review_body": "I have a couple of luxury watches - a Girard Perregaux that I use for formal occasions and a Tag Heuer for everyday use. The steel band on my Tag broke, and I used that as an excuse to finally upgrade. I considered a Rolex, Cartier (Roadster), Breitling, Omega, or another GP. After prowling around luxury watch forums/reviews, I settled on the Omega SPS as having the best value for the money. Rolex makes great watches, but they're so ubiquitous with so many fakes floating around that it doesn't feel \"special\". Cartier seems to be widely panned by luxury watch afficionados - apparently its mechanism is so sensitive that it must be sent in to Cartier for routine maintenance every 3-5 years at a cost of $700 a pop!! The Breitling models I liked have monstrous sizes...they looked incongrous on my 7\" wrist. In the end, I settled on the Omega SPS - and I believe I made the right decision. It's gorgeous - it looks and feels substantitive without looking pretentious. The red/orange 6, 9, and 12 numbers on the dial catches the eye. I think this is a great luxury watch for everyday use. It certainly feels like it can take a lot of abuse.",

                "review_body": "Make sure to get the one with non-red markers, James Bond wears the version with all white markers.  James Bond also wears the XL version (45.5mm case)  And obviously, he doesn't wear the one with the orange bezel (yeeech).  There are two versions of this watch coming out just like for the last James Bond watch.  But seriously, do you think James Bond would wear a watch that says \"Quantum of Solace\" or \"007\" engraved in back of his watch?  Seriously.  Do yourself a favor and get NOT get the limited edition, but the regular model.  But I guess people buy for different reasons.\n\nHaving said that, this is a great, practical watch for everyday wear if you want to look cool with a touch of class.  I would not wear this for sports or to the gym because I like to keep my watches in near mint condition.  The price is not awfully expensive as a Rolex but works possibly even better and looks just as great as a Rolex.  I'm very suprised how much the Omega Seamaster is beginning to look more and more like a Rolex Submariner.  The last Seamaster is quite distintive in that it's Bond version has a blue face with a nice geometrically carved bezel and intricate bracelet band (but not to everyone's tastes).  Now, for the Planet Ocean, we see the famous fluted bezel that is signature of Rolex.  We see the Bond version is all black a la Bond Rolex Submariner.  And gone also is the intricate-looking band which now looks very much like the Rolex Oyster bracelet with just a slightly different line of design.  There are some differences.  The PO case is quite elegant and very reminiscent of car body design.  However, the side profile of the case still lacks the elegance of Rolex.  Another obvious difference is the size.  The Rolex Submariner is 40mm which is perfect for any wrist.  Last Seamster Professional was 41mm which is still perfect.  This watch?  A whopping 45.5mm!!!  It's huge.  Make sure you are fine with the size.  With a large diametered case also comes the added weight!  I love the nice heft but this may not be suitable for everyone.  Although many of these differences are quite subjective, what is pretty much objective is the clasp of these watches.  Time and time again, people complain why the most famous all watches come with a flimsy, cheap clasp?  Omega Seamaster clasp totally blows it away as it is very solid and quite easy to operate.\n\nSo now we have an Omega that looks and feels much like a Rolex.  Omega is like the Lexus of watches.  It does a lot of things great and maybe even better but it will always be second status to Rolex a la Lexus to Mercedes.  No matter how hard Lexus tries to be a Mercedes, it will always be a Lexus.  With that said, both Lexus and Omega make solid, quality products with a more affordable price tag.  Give this, I would wear an Omega practicially everyday and just leave the special occasions for my Rolex Submariner.  However if you are really particular on wanting the very best, you may want to be a bit more patient in saving for that Rolex.  I gave so many reasons to buy this watch but the only reason to buy a Rolex is because it's a Rolex!",

                "review_body": "I love this watch. The 2201.51 (black bezel / orange numerals) was given to me as a gift and I have not taken it off since I received it. I don't track how accurate it is to the second like some people do, but suffice to say that it is very very accurate, and I believe what others have said about this movement.\n\nThere are three things I absolutely love about this watch.\n\nFirst, the clarity: It is about as clear and easy to read as I have ever had. Irrespective of light, a quick glance will always tell me the time. In dark light, the superluminova makes it very easy. I suspect this has to do with antireflective coating on both sides of the sapphire and all that tech stuff but frankly, all I care for is the end value to me.\n\nSecond, the fit and finish of the case and bracelet are absolutely top notch. Its almost a work of art because of the amount of detail in the watch. Everything from the hippocampus engraving in the back to the placement of the crowns. Everything is \"just\" right and it feels very natural.\n\nThird, despite the fact that this is technically a sports watch (I swim once in a while and keep it on), I wear it to work and dressy occasions. Since its not super flashy and I usually wear long cuffs, people don't usually notice  it. Frankly, I like that it goes under the radar like that. That said, twice someone did comment on it, and both times they knew exactly what it was! Must be watch affectionados.\n\nNeedless to say, I love this watch and wear it everyday. If you have the money, it is definitely worth the price of entry. I'm not a collector so for me, I don't think I'll be purchasing another watch anytime soon.\n\nUPDATE AFTER 1 YEAR: Still loving this timepiece. It ticks away and is quite accurate. I have made the mistake of trying to reset the time (while travelling) near 12 and the watch gave me a warning sign with a \"click\"...so I'll be careful not to do that anymore. The 48hour charge is accurate. When I leave it sitting, it will go about 2 days before stopping. Outside of that; it ticks away quite reliably. I must say that over the course of the last year, this watch has really grown on me. I am enjoying it more today than I did when I first got it...which I believe is a testament to the seemingly obsessive workmanship that goes into its production.",

                "review_body": "Just got this over the weekend. Looks very majestic, feels great to wear. Looks way better in hand than what the picture at the Amazon site shows. The dial is more Platinum-silver in color than what looks like pure white in the picture at site. The watch gives an impression of aristocracy and fine craftsmanship. How it performs over long period is something to be seen. I'll post updates here later. There are are a lot of sites that sells this watch. But buyers beware as internet is washed with counterfeits. I bought it from Amazon because I trust Amazon. So should you.\n\n07/02/15: Update - I've been wearing this watch all these months. Still looks as elegant and great as did when it was brand new out of the box. I don't wear it all the time but at least for 3 days a week, to match with rest of my outfit. I use other watches on other days. Here are few observations to share. When it was brand new out of the box, the leather strap was very stiff to wrap around the wrist. It took quite a bit of wearing to get the strap to conform to my wrist shape. While on that topic, because the watch's leather strap is traditional buckle type, you need to be careful when wearing it or taking it off, as it might slip off and fall to the ground. I dropped it twice that way but luckily, it fell on carpet and the watch didn't sustain any damage or scratch from that. You don't want any damage to happen to such a fine, expensive timepiece. Also, I suggest you invest in a good watch winder to keep it on motion when you are not wearing for few days or so. I use the Brookstone's winder. Very quiet machine. Another thing I have noticed that it gains a minute or so every 30 days. This is not unusual for automatic watches. I have another Tissot automatic watch and that gains about 2 minutes every few weeks to a month or so. Bottom line, this is a beautiful piece of jewelry for a man to own and wear.  Two thumbs up from me.",

This Seamaster 300m Co-Axial Chonometer is a great luxury watch, stylish and manly.  Be careful to learn about Authorized Dealers vs. \"Grey Market\" watches.  ALL Omegas sold online are \"Grey Market\" since Omega does not allow internet sales, hence your warranty will probably not be honored by Omega directly but by some watch company (beware!).

The customer service was very helpful, they insured the Omega international warranty (which was very important to me) and everything is perfect. The watch itself is gorgeous: the blue waves are great looking, the luminescent hands and markers work even in the daytime and the bracelet is extremely comfortable. I highly recommend buying this watch especially from timepiece trading, because they are the only online dealer that actually has the OMEGA warranty, not some BS of their own.",

I probably wear it 60% of the time.  I feel complexity reduces reliability so I chose this over watches with more funtions.  It will initally feel a bit heavy but you adjust to that very quickly.  I have had absolutely no issues with it.  The rotating Bezel does require more force than you expect.  I'm sure that is by design.  The glowing hands are great for the movie theater.\nOmegas are a bit different.  Other Omega watch wearers will say things to you about it.  There is sometimes an expectation that you know something about your watch and other watches if you wear an Omega. Not a lot but it happens. People who are just interested in the Jewelery tend to go another way.",

First, my watch shipped from Amazon, so I can't vouch for watches that come from Amazon's partner websites.  In short, the watch arrived as I expected new in the original box with all docs including the warranty card and operating instructions.  As others have mentioned, Omega might not acknowledge the warranty on this watch because it was not purchased through an authorized dealer.  Instead, Amazon provides a 2-year warranty.  I decided the price difference between amazon.com and an authorized dealer was significant enough to justify going with Amazon.  The watch is 100% real with serial numbers intact.  Overall, this is a beautiful watch; I've even received compliments on it from strangers.  If you are looking for a full sized sports watch, I'd recommend this Omega; you won't be disappointed.",

I took it to the Swatch Service Center in Toronto, and in 20 minutes they had it adjusted perfectly--for free, as it was in warranty.  It now gains 1 - 2 seconds a day, and that's outstanding accuracy for a mechanical watch.\n\nThis watch is very handsome and has an easy to read dial.  The band is very comfortable, and is noted for not pulling hairs like some watch bands.  The watch does not \"wander\" on your arm like some; it stays perfectly centered on my wrist.  The sapphire crystal shrugs off encounters that would leave an ordinary watch crystal dinged or scratched.\n\nI think the movement is the most advanced of any mechanical movement in the world.  It is accurate and requires less frequent maintenance than similar brands.\n\nOmega has hit a home run with its co-axial escapement movement and its Seamaster series.  I have the \"Quantum of Solace\" Planet Ocean Seamaster model, and it is also superbly accurate--and handsome.  I don't see why anyone would want to pay thousands more for a Rolex, or for one of those \"avant garde\" pieces that no \"man of action\" would be caught dead wearing!",

This comes from spending 2 years in watchmaking school, studying directly under the guidance of a certified master swiss watchmaker who came here from Europe.  Watches, especially mid to high grade swiss watches, are a passion of mine.  I am not loyal to a brand or a style or anything else.  I judge them for what they are, in terms of quality, function, construction, and style.  A watchmakers point of view.\n\nThis said I will tell you that this particular watch is what I consider to be a \"best kept secret\" sort of watch.  This is an AUTOMATIC watch (read: Mechanical - NOT Quartz), and of CHRONOMETER grade function.  Chronometer as used here is a measure of accurate timekeeping, not quality - a point often misunderstood - and is used mostly from a marketing point of view by companies such as Rolex.  HOWEVER.  This movement in THIS watch is actually EXCELLENT in terms of quality, time keeping ability, and construction - easily comparable to other Swiss made movements from other famous manufacturers costing several times as much.  This watch, properly serviced, will provide a lifetime of use - and probably more.  Absolutely the sort of watch you pass down to the next generation.\n\nAll in all - and EXCELLENT choice - especially for those seeking their first QUALITY Swiss watch purchase.\n\nDefinitely recommended!",

For me - the most recommended watch ever in it's price-range.\nIts insanely beautiful,it's very solid and reliable mechanicaly, it's very,very well built on the outside too, it's infinitely more recognizable and prestigious(if that's what counts for you)then anything(I mean watches) you can get for this amount of $$. It's less then 1/2 of the price of a basic Rolex(hey! don't lough at Rolex!)\nSpeaking of prices:\nDo shop around! It's not a new model, prices vary greatly. Even here on Amazon it changes a lot.Used to be 200 bucks less a couple of months ago as far as I remember.Maby they found a more reliable dealer,or maby for other reasons.Buy online without a warranty? Your decision.These are reliable, meticulously tested watches,but still..Buy internationally?get the international warranty then.\nI got my 2220 here in Poland.It sells usually for the company's sugested price:3,300$ or a little more. But you can get discounts up to 15-20% if you ask for it.Mine was an exposition piece for 15 months, in perfect conditions though(fingerprints of customers wiped away)and since the dealer was certified by omega:with all the warranty cards and the chronometer certificate card and whatever else.\nI got 30% discount on it (paid about 2,400 US$).This way I saved about 950 dollars which will be spent for presents for the less economicaly lucky members of my family. But that's already a different story.\nI hope that helped.",

                "review_body": "I recently purchased the Omega Seamaster 300m Chronometer from a local certified Omega dealer so my review is for the watch not the company who sells it.\n\nThe weight and feel of this watch is perfect, it is well balanced and it doesn't wander around the wrist like cheaper watches do.  The watch is not light but I wouldn't call it heavy either, especially for a 300 meter dive watch.\n\nThe watch is a work of art; the lines and details are fantastic.  In photos the bracelet looked a little too busy to for my taste so I intended to buy the Planet ocean, after trying both on I changed my mind, the comfort, style and the streamlined feel of the 300m sold me.  There are a million Submariner look-alike watches in the world, the Omega Seamaster is NOT one of them, it is truly unique.\n\nThe mechanical movement has been great (adding about 2 seconds per day.) the clasp is solid and built to last, the bezel feels great and I love the wave-cut design around the edge.  The 41 mm face is the perfect size for me, it will be the standard for any watch I purchase in the future.\n\nTo me the negatives are small but they include the hands and the lume.  The Skeletonized hands look great and make for a clean watch face but they are difficult to read at night.  The Illumination is average and the small lumme points on the hands are nearly unreadable in the dark.  Nevertheless I love this watch and I am very pleased with my purchase.",

I have never owned a more accurate mechanical watch in my life. It is a medium sized watch in stainless steel with the dark blue bezel. I never take this watch off except to sleep. I bought a watch winder but this runs 3 days without. Someone might tell me that spending this kind of money on a watch is a mistake. The only mistake I made was waiting this long to buy one. Look at what you spend on watches in a lifetime, cleaning, service and repairs. This is the last watch you'll ever buy. Nothing else comes close. This is the watch that the sattelites check.

I have sent the watch in to Omega for its first 4 year service. They did a great job polishing and rebuilding the movement so it is back to COSC specs. I own another Omega Spedmaster, I feel that Omega makes a high quality timepiece that is worth the price. I prefer the Omega over the Rolex submariner.

                "review_body": "I actually own this specific watch (#2220.80.00) and is my 2nd Omega (have five year old Speedmaster). It is a beautiful watch and like other Omegas you get comments on it. If you have not owned an Omega then you will be impressed by the feel and quality of the watch. For these kind of watches it doesn't feel heavy at all but a comfortable feel to it when wearing. Accuracy? Let's face it, a cheap $20 quartz is more accurate but it is rated a chronometer (don't confuse the term chronograph with lots of dials) and I gain 2 seconds a day. This is good because it is easy to update but stopping the clock a few seconds a day and watches tend to slow until the next cleaning. The Co-Axial feature is not a gimick (look at the Omega site for an animation on how this works) and results in the watch being certified a chronometer. Compared to my older non-coaxial Speedmaster (new ones have coaxial) here are my observations:\n*With my older automatic you could feel the automatic movement as it spun around when wearing it. The Seamaster doesn't have that moment and is quiet. When listening to it much more pleasant than the Speedmaster but I know most would say who cares.\n*With my older automatic when you did rewind it it would offer a lot of resistance and almost cut into your thumb. The new one offers just a little resistance but rewinds the watch. You could wind it all day without getting callouses.\n\nAs for as warrenty: Others have pointed out that you lose one year of warrenty if you buy it through Amazon. I also think you may not get the card that certifies it is a chronometer which may be important for some and not for others. I bought it through the Navy exchange military store but of course not an option for some. The advantage is that the military is a certified Omega seller.\n\nOnly negative (maybe not for some): The watch dial is really more black than blue as shown in the picture...looks more like black wave not blue wave. OK, maybe it is a dark Navy blue. Still not a deal breaker for this watch. Good value for the price. I've found I didn't really need all the \"bells and whistles\" of my chronogragh Speedmaster. If you need reading glasses nice to have big broad dials such as this watch which is easy to read.",

                "review_body": "I have been looking at this watch for quite sometimes now. I was having difficulity deciding between the Automatic and Quartz versions. The advantage of this one is that I do not need to replace the battery every 1-2 years. Amazon seems to be out of stock for this one for quite sometimes now and I do not trust the third party sellers since buying from the internet void the Omega warranty.\n  I went to a local jeweler one day and it happens that they are having a sale. The local jeweler can be found as an authorized dealer on Omega and fully cover by the Omega warranty. I decided to bite the bullet and bought it. I am glad I did. Here are a few thought on the watch.\n\n- The watch is very solid and robust\n- The watch seem a little bit heavier then my previous watches\n- The watch is very accurate so far. only 1 -2 sec runs faster then the atomic clock every day.\n- The color and style stands out and it can be wear on any occasion. causal/dress suite\n- This same exact watch worn by James Bond in Casino Royale when he was playig poker at the casino ( the beginning of the movie he was wearing the Seamaster Planet Ocean with rubber strap)\n- According to omega you only need to service it every 4- 5 years for normal use.\n- Bracelet has a quick extension feature to accomodate diver wetsuit.\n\na few things to keep in mind - note these are not negative thoughts\n\n-Like any automatic watch it will not be always accurate. Many owners on the Internet have reported their Seamasters often far exceed COSC standards in daily use. Be prepare to adjust the time every now and then. In reality we have the adjust twice a year for day light saving time anyway. I do not mind at all\n- May need to manually wind it if you dont wear it  for long period of time. I recommend buying a watch winder for people who wear the watch occasionally.\n- the helium relief vaulve is useless in my opinion even with the any form of normal suba diving. but it is a unique feature to the watch so I dont mind.\n- may be expensive to service the watch and may require sending it to authorized omega repair center.\n\nOver all this is an excellent watch. I would highly recommend this watch to anyone who is looking for a watch in this price range",

                "review_body": "I've owned my \"James Bond\" Automatic Mov't Omega for 9 years.  I own 1 other Omega, but this one is my everyday watch.  I've had no problems at all.  It's never been serviced and still keeps near perfect time, gains 2 or 3 seconds every 6 or 7 days.  I have had it pressure tested twice over the years.  The last time was 2 years ago.  Still as tight as ever.  My only complaint.  The rotating bezel on mine is extremely stiff and somewhat difficult to turn, and the edge bevels are not really pronounced enough to give you good grip.  The only evident wear and tear on mine is typical hairline scratches on the band and clasp.  The watch case, crown, and crystal still appear flawless, and this is my everyday watch.  A few comments about the warranty.  The Standard Manufacturer's Warranty is only 1 year, after that your own own, unless you purchase the extended Amazon Warranty.  Personally, like most extended warranties, I don't think it's necessary.  If the watch works when you receive it, then it will still be working a year later, 2 years later, etc.  And note that the warranties do not cover accidental breakage or damage.  I also feel the same way about \"General Maintenance/Servicing\". If it's not broke don't fix it.  If it's not keeping good time, then look into getting serviced.  The recommended \"service intervals\" are just a good way to lift some money from your pocket.  \"Grey Market Vendors...\", I see no problem in purchasing from an internet vendor as long as you do your research and know they are reputable.  You will save plenty over what you would pay in a regular store front jewelry store.  I purchased mine over the internet and saved $800 over what the local jewelry stores were charging, plus the savings on sales tax....  I decided not to worry about not having any true warranty because the vendor had a 30 day money back gurantee.  Like I said, if it works when you get it, it will still be working a year later.  The money I saved more than outweighed the 1 year manufacturers warranty.  One last note.... You will probably need it sized to your wrist.  If you purchase from the internet, then just find a local watch repair shop that services higher end watches, they will do it for you.  DO NOT GO TO a Mall Kiosk like Watch Works, etc!!\nWear it and Enjoy it.  You can't take it with you!",

                "review_body": "I got this watch as a gift from my wife earlier this year in June.. Absolutely love it! Being a big James Bond fan, I was glad I finally have this watch! Growing up watching Pierce Brosnan playing Bond, I fell in love with the watch he wore which was similar to this. Beautiful blue bezel and dial. The one worn by Brosnan was the older 2531.80 model. This is a very nice revamp of that model but with the Co-Axial movement and the applied hour markers so it looks much more grandeur than the older one did. An instant classic... And Daniel Craig did wear this same model in Casino Royale!\n\nThe overall looks of the watch is really good and the wave patterns on the dial looks great under the light. The watch feels very well made, not surprising coming from a brand like Omega. The luminosity of the watch is pretty good and can last all night, bright enough to tell the time in the dark. Its neither too heavy nor too light, with a perfect weight that feels good around the wrist without it feeling too heavy. The bracelet, although complex and complicated to resize by yourself, is extremely comfortable and is probably the most comfortable stainless steel bracelet there is out there right now.\n\nIt also has a nice brushed finish with smaller links that are polished. A very nice looking bracelet that looks dressy enough to be worn formally and casually. The clasp however scratches easily. The scratches will appear no matter how well you take care of it and I feel the scratches will add character to the watch.\n\nBeing a watch aficionado, I wear this watch more now than I do my other watches. This is really a beautiful looking watch! Omega is discontinuing this model soon, so grab yours before it is gone. Currently, it is one of the most affordably priced Omega watch out there in the market when compared with the other Omega watches. Highly recommended! Especially if you are a James Bond fan!",

                "review_body": "I own two of these watches; the mechanical one pictured here (in black) and a quartz model in blue.  The watch is, in a word, a work of art.  A couple of things you should know about it, though:\n\n1)  This model has been discontinued, and the replacement model does not have the iconic \"wave dial\" that sets this watch apart.  The new model has a ceramic bezel and the watch face is a glossy blue or black.  I personally think they ruined the watch by getting rid of the wave dial, both because it was beautiful and because it set this watch apart from other dive watches.  I ended up buying mine from the 'secondary market' (i.e., an authorized dealer who was selling out existing stock), but if you want one of these treasures, you should buy it quickly while there are still a few around.\n\n2)  Do not buy the watch from this site.  You can buy this watch from various sources for around $2,700.  Authorized dealers who still have some in stock have been allowed to offer deep discounts given that this model has been discontinued, and at least for now, there's a decent number of pre-owned but mint condition watches out there.\n\nPrice isn't the only reason to avoid this site.  When you buy a watch from Amazon or any other non-authorized dealer, the manufacturer warranty is void and the serial numbers have been scratched off the watches.  That's why you see these items advertised with something other than the manufacturer warranty.  The serial numbers are scratched off to prevent Omega from getting these watches and identifying the original authorized dealer.  The watches are 100% authentic (some people have erroneously said they're fakes), but because they've been sold through this gray market, there is no manufacturer warranty and you will find it considerably more difficult to sell this watch second-hand if you ever want to.",

                "review_body": "This 2006 edition of the famous James Bond watch made its debut in the movie Casino Royale.  Actually, there are two Omega watches in the movie; the limited edition Omega Seamaster Plant Ocean Big Size 2907.50.91 and the limited edition Omega Seamaster Chronometer 2226.80.00.  The watch offered here carries on the James Bond style without the limited edition price tag.\n\nThis style of the James Bond watch first appeared in the movie 'Golden Eye' (1995) and is still available as the full size gents model 2531.80.00.  The new 2006 model 2220.80.00 has several refinements that you should consider over the previous (but still available) model.  Most notably, the automatic movement now has the newly designed Co-Axial escapement.  The Co-Axial Technology reduces sliding friction compared with the lever escapement in the previous model and ensures greater accuracy over time.  More importantly, it doesn't require servicing for 10 years versus 2-3 years in the previous model.  Servicing a luxury watch like Omega can be expensive.  Bear in mind that any Omega watch purchased on the internet voids the International Warranty, so read the seller's warranty terms carefully.  This watch is also available in a quartz version as model 2221.80.00.\n\nThe other big change is the appearance of the watch face.  The blue wave dial is a deeper shade blue with a more distinctive wave pattern and the Seamaster script is a subtle red.  More apparent is the hour markings are now encased in stainless steel mountings instead of painted on as in the previous model.  This alone cleans up the watch face and makes it look like it costs thousands more.\n\nIf you desire a James Bond series watch with a true Swiss movement, this is the one.",

I would highly advise buying these only from Amazon directly, and not through the Z shop. If you buy it from amazon, there is a 2 year limited warranty. I have copied and pasted the amazon warranty for everyone's convenience.\n\n\"The Amazon.com Two-Year Limited Watch Warranty\n\nAll of the watches from the Amazon.com Collection are genuine and authentic with serial numbers intact. We work hard to bring you high-quality products at competitive prices. Amazon is an authorized dealer of many brands of watches. As an authorized dealer, we can offer you a watch with the manufacturer's warranty in place. Amazon also buys watches from other authorized dealers, distributors, and other established lines of distribution within the watch industry. A benefit of buying through these alternative channels is that we are able to offer you a highly competitive price. The manufacturer's warranty on these watches may not be valid. In the case that the manufacturer's warranty is not valid, Amazon.com offers an industry-leading 2-year limited warranty to cover your watch.\n\nWhat the Amazon.com Limited Two-Year Warranty Covers Our warranty will cover the watch in the event that it stops moving due to a defect in the watch's movement mechanisms. Before you try to service the watch, make sure that the battery hasn't died. Your watch will come with a warranty card listing the terms and conditions (as stated below) of the Amazon.com 2-Year Limited Warranty.\n\nWarranty Terms\n\nDuration and scope of the limited warranty: This limited warranty lasts for two (2) years from the date of purchase and covers watches purchased from Amazon.com LLC in the continental United States of America, Alaska and Hawaii.\n\nTHE MANUFACTURER'S WARRANTY DOES NOT APPLY TO THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE WE ARE NOT AN AUTHORIZED RESELLER OF THIS WATCH. THIS WARRANTY IS THE ONLY EXPRESS WARRANTY COVERING THIS WATCH AND WE DISCLAIM ANY LIABILITY UNDER THE MANUFACTURER'S WARRANTY.\n\nWhat is covered?\n\nAmazon warrants that the internal movement mechanisms of the watch are free from defects.\n\nWhat is not covered?\n\nThis warranty is limited and does not cover any damage to parts not used in the movement of the watch, including, without limitation, watch bracelets, straps, crystals, finish, batteries, crowns/stems, or cases. This limited warranty does not cover any damage (1) if there is evidence of excessive wear and tear, (2) if there is evidence of intentional or accidental misuse or abuse, including, without limitation, abuse related to servicing not carried out by authorized service centers, or (3) if used under conditions which exceed the watch manufacturer's water resistance guidelines.\n\nExclusions and conditions:\n\nCONSEQUENTIAL AND INCIDENTAL DAMAGES ARE NOT RECOVERABLE UNDER THIS WARRANTY OR ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\nIn order to have coverage under this warranty, the serial number imprinted on the watch casing must be clearly legible and no part of the original watch back or original number has been removed, changed, altered, replaced, erased or defaced.\n\nIF ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS LONGER THAN THIS TWO-YEAR EXPRESS WARRANTY, THE IMPLIED WARRANTY IS LIMITED TO THE TWO-YEAR PERIOD OF THIS WARRANTY. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\nHow state law applies:\n\nTHIS WARRANTY GIVES YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS, AND YOU MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER RIGHTS, WHICH VARY FROM STATE TO STATE.\n\nWhat Amazon.com will do:\n\nAt Amazon.com's choice and cost, Amazon.com will have your defective watch repaired or replace your watch, or refund the amount that you paid for the watch to you.\n\nHow to get service:\n\nTo obtain instructions on how to obtain service under this warranty, contact customer service at 1 (866) 548-0880 or visit [...] You are responsible for postage charges and any insurance for shipment to the service facility. The repaired watch will be returned to you at our cost if the return address that you provide is in the continental U.S., or Alaska or Hawaii, or at your cost if you provide a return address located outside the continental U.S., or Alaska or Hawaii. When you send the watch to the service facility, please include a brief description of the problem. \"\n\nThe watches are much \"prettier\" in person. Keep in mind you will need to service these watches every 5 years (10 for the automatics), and service costs about $200+.",

There is a 3 year warranty on the watch through the seller, WatchMaxx.

They did not disappoint yet again!!!!\n\nI received the watch via UPS and the packaging was neat and complete.  To erase all doubts about the authenticity of the watch, I took it to an OMEGA boutique store and had them inspect he watch.  Although they could not officially \"certified\" the watch, the boutique manager had no doubts the watch I purchased from Amazon was authentic.\n\nI have been wearing the watch for about one month now and I am glad I went with Omega.  The watch keeps its time well as I wear it everyday.  The design fits well with any setting.\n\nI have no regrets purchasing my first high end watch through Amazon!!!",

I was a Bond fan like any red-blooded American boy, and so when I saw this watch featured so prominently in the laser cutting scene on the train in Goldeneye...well, you get the idea.  I ended up buying one much later when I was in high school, but it was a model from the 1980s and I tried to flip it on eBay.  I got it for $450, which I thought was super cheap.  Ended up selling it for $450.\n\nWhen I was applying for real jobs after a stint in the IDF I told myself that as soon as I could, I would buy this watch.  I saved and saved, and the time came.  I ended up first getting the mid-size version off a really good eBay deal.  Well, I am 6'4 and 200 pounds.  So, I'm not a small person really.  The mid-size should be avoided at all costs - it's not the watch you want.\n\nLook, I could write a novel about my Omega that I purchased here on Amazon.  I bought it back in 2012, and it has been a workhorse ever since.  I only take it off to exercise, sleep, and serious manual labor.  I love wearing it when I shoot guns or do manly stuff, just like Bond would do.\n\nThe 2220.80 is amazing, and Amazon gives you a mint, brand new, in box, absolutely legit model.

The watch fits my wrist well.  I really like the push button style clasp.  I was very apprehensive about buying this watch from Amazon, but decided to give it a try due to all the positive customer feedbacks.  I'm so happy that I did.  I saved a bundle.  The watch arrived the next day - all documentation was there - including the Omega certificate.  I took the watch to my local watch shop and had the bracelet adjusted.  Cost $15.  All in all, I am very happy with this watch and with the Amazon buying experience.\n\nUpdate (Feb. 2010 - It's been over a year now and I still love this watch.  I am very impressed by the accuracy - I'm getting about -1 second per day.  Not bad for an automatic.  After a year of daily wearing in all sorts of situation - swimming in the ocean, doing yard work, computer work, etc - not a single scratch on the crystal.  However, the watch band (bracelet) and bezel are prone to scratches.  I wish the bezel has a coin edge like that of the Rolex'es.  The  scalloped edge is hard to turn.",

I didn't wind it too hard or too much but at some point the watch stopped working. I thought I had overwound it--which it's not supposed to be possible with self winding, automatic watches--so I left it to rest for a few days and lo and behold the watch started to work again! However, I've noticed that the crown has a lot more resistance than before plus it recoils a bit when being wound. Yes, Omega makes one heck of a product but I'm disappointed of the 2500 C caliber.  It's basically an ETA-based model. Although heavily modified, the ETA movement that Omega based its 2500 caliber on is only worth about $129 retail! Granted, Omega turns this movement into a COSC-certified chronometer--and I must say a very accurate one (it runs only 4 seconds a day fast, which falls perfectly within the COSC specifications).  Other than the movement though, the quality of the case, dial, hands, and bracelet is unmatched!  I just wish Omega would have matched this model with a slightly higher quality caliber.  All in all, it's a beautiful time piece to look at.  You'll never get tired of looking at it--even when it doesn't work. As I once read on a quote, with this time piece \"time is just an excuse.\"",

                "review_body": "Well, I guess I was supposed to have this watch.  I had always wanted a Seamaster Cronometer Automatic, but never saw myself spending this kind of money, not to mention the price at an authorized dealer.  Amazon sent me an email a week or so ago that had special 12 months no interest on select watches.  I looked and looked and finally pulled the trigger on this fantastic blue face large size automatic.  Actually, I ordered on July 31, 2009 and for $6.99 extra with Amazon Prime had it at my door before 10:00 a.m. this morning.  It's a good thing I took advantage of the offer, because as of today, the \"12 months\" offer is no more and the price has actually gone up!\n\nI had somewhat of a concern by ordering a \"gray market\" watch, but I had ordered a Luminox ETA automatic from Amazon about 4 or 5 years ago and had good luck with it and also saved about $200.00.\n\nI read all of the reviews here on Amazon and even went to watch forums such as [...] and read reviews.  The folks on timezone appear to only purchase through authorized dealers.  Fortunately by going to a forum I learned about some very important things surrounding the watch such as serial numbers and a little \"red dot\" that Omega applies to watches out of the factory.  I had concerns about this and thought that if I saw anything suspicious that I could just return the watch to Amazon.  Man was I happy after inspecting it!  Sure enough, all of the serial numbers were there from the multiple cards that come with the watch to the little \"medallions\" that are tied to the watch upon opening.  The watch itself has the laser engraved serial number in the appropriate place also.  I had heard that some \"gray market\" watches do not come with everything, from what I have seen, my purchase from Amazon did.  I realize that it can only be covered under warranty through Amazon, but by saving hundreds if not close to a \"grand\" that's fine with me.\n\nNow to that little \"red dot\".  Sure enough it is there and it acts as a tiny little \"bridge\" between the case and the screwed on case back.  It tells you if anyone has opened the case since it came from the factory as the little dot will break upon opening the case.  I guess if someone really wanted to take the time they could \"paint\" it back on, but it would be difficult as I'm not sure it's exactly paint.\n\nThis is the new \"007\" watch with the Co-Axial movement in it and it is super quiet!  If I didn't know that it was an auto, I'd think it was a quartz.  You can't feel it moving around either on your wrist.\n\nThe fit and finish of the watch is second to none.  I'm really not sure why Rolex charges as much as they do, the Omega seems like a bargain actually, even though it's still an expensive watch.  So far, as I write this review at 4:31 p.m., it seems to be keeping fine time.  I'll have to wait and see how it is tomorrow.  When I received my Luminox I had to take it and have it calibrated as it was way too fast upon arrival, it keeps perfect time now.  I'm hoping that this Omega Chronometer will not need adjusting.  You'd think since it is a \"certified chronometer\" that you would not need it, but I've read of several people having to have theirs adjusted, even folks that bought from authorized dealers.\n\nI can see why this model is so popular, it's just a really fine time piece.  Those luminous hands and hour markers as just as stated, they glow bright and for a long time!\n\nI know that some say that they would NEVER buy \"gray market\", but I've always had excellent service with Amazon and since I had no issues with my first watch from them, I'm sure glad I took advantage of their offer and purchased this fine time piece!  All in all, for the savings it was worth it and I'll continue to purchase my time pieces from Amazon.\n\nHope this review helps anyone with reservations about purchasing an expensive time piece from Amazon.\n\nTake care\n\nUPDATE: December 13, 2009\n\nMerry Christmas all.  Just wanted to give a short update on my SMP 300.  As You can see, I purchased this watch back in August.  This has to be one of the finest watches that I have ever purchased hands down!  It keeps perfect time.  I can set it to an atomic clock and it will still be within 1 second 72hrs later.  Amazing.  Again, by purchasing mine through Amazon, it came with all of the cards, boxes, matching serial numbers, red dot on caseback in tact, everything!\n\nSeasons Greetings!\n\nUPDATE 10/24/2010 - This still has got to be one of THE best purchases I have ever made!  This watch is just truly fantastic.  I have had zero problems with it and it just keeps fantastic time.  It's amazing that a mechanical watch can keep this good of time.  The watch is just plain solid and wears extremely well.  I wear this thing everyday to work and to work out in the yard in and it still looks brand new.  If you've been contemplating this watch and Amazon is offering it directly, then you will not be sorry if you purchase it.  I stress though, I would only feel comfortable purchasing it though if Amazon were the merchant and not a 3rd party.  I realize that there are fine and honest 3rd party vendors, but with Amazon, you know that they will take care of you.  It also comes with all cards, papers and such from Amazon.  I love this watch!\n\nUPDATE: 12 Years Later - August 2022\nWatch is still just as perfect as the day I received it.  Have never had to have it serviced and keeps extremely good time.\n\nIt\u2019s a shame that some people have had problems, in addition to receiving a used watch, it appears.  I made certain to buy mine directly from Amazon as the vendor rather than a 3rd party.  Not that it would have mattered; I don\u2019t know.\n\nIt\u2019s still a fantastic watch that I bought for $2150 here on Amazon.",

Returned for fu refund.\n\nMy dream watch with box and papers on Amazon for a reasonable price.  To good to be true.\n\nRecieved watch which was is a more modern Omega box which was the first warning sign.  With no warranty card, manual, or papers.  I took to an Omega dealer who authenticated the watch for me to find that it was real and was +10 sec a day (in need for service ($600)).  Watch came with a scratched bezel and polishing wheel marks and rounded edges on the braclet (as a sign of a poor polishing job).  Furthermoe, the 12'oclock marker on the bezel did not match up with 12 o'clock marker on the dial.  These idicators clearly established that the watch was in fact USED and not in new/unworn condition.  Bracelet was missing numerous sizing links which would have required approx $200 - $300 in additional cost just to be able to wear it.  I returned the watch for a full refund with very responsive customer service.\n\nFound same watch on ebay in better condition with all sizing links for 25% less.  Would not buy from this vendor again.  Buy with caution, to good to be true.\n\nPhoto's are off watch imperfections and fake warranty card wallet compared to a real one in an Omega boutique.",

The watch itself is pretty comfortable, but it took me a day or so to get used to. I have the blue version. It has a butterfly clasp for the bracelet. I like the finer details of the watch as well, like the fact that the second hand has a subtle red tip. This watch is a fun watch, it's not small, but as you can see from my photos, it's not huge either. I have a very small wrist, so if you have even a normal-sized wrist, it should wear a little smaller. Great watch and I've had no issues so far. Did not buy through Amazon.",

                "review_body": "I'd had my eyes on a Rado R5.5 for over 3 years when I finally decided to reward myself for a personal Christmas present. This is the most expensive thing I have ever bought online so naturally I was nervous, but the good news is that you literally can't go wrong with Amazon. With the steep discount, zero taxes, and free two day shipping, I'm left feeling stupid for paying full msrp in the past on my other Rados in brick and mortar stores. And rest assured, this is 100% real, validated by the local watch technician.\n\nI chose this particular model because it has a cleaner look than the models with the two additional timers and buttons on the side. When worn, the solid black looks sharp and contemporary , so this may not be a \"shorts and t-shirt\" kind of watch. Also, one thing I didn't realize is that the links get substantially narrow on the inside which causes the R5.5 to feel more delicate than some other watches, but then again I only wear it to dressier occasions so it's not really an issue. Overall I couldn't be happier with the look and the value I received purchasing this new Rado. I will definitely consider buying from Amazon again.",

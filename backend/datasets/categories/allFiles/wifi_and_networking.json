Having 3 separate zoom calls in parallel was impossible. 2 was barely possible.\nThen I decided to plunge into the deep end with this, and... this 3-pack has totally changed our online lives! 4 full video calls in parallel, 4 phones, 3 iPads, assorted appliances,... blazing through without a hiccup! The WiFi signal is amazing and I know it is quite an overkill for a 3-pack for the size of my home but... I\u2019ll do it again in a flash!\nInstallation was not problem-free and the distance sensing function in the app was not working. Skip that and the rest is smooth. For the first router, a firmware download was needed, that was over quickly. Just look at the flashing light color to know what step to take next. This was even easier than adding the XFINITY pods!",

The firmware update was very easy. The app told me there was an update available and you just select to update. It automatically updated each device with no issues.\n\nI have just completed the setup so I can't speak to reliability yet. That will come over the next couple of months.\n\nThe coverage is a drastic improvement from my previous setup. I had a Spectrum supplied modem/router combo before. I purchased my own modem and added the TaoToonics mesh system. My house is around 3500 SF and our wifi signal in the basement was spoty at best. I placed one device in the office connected to the modem. The second device is wired backhauled from the living room. The third one is in the basement. I now get speeds of 250 from the basement. No more buffering while playing games or watching Netflix/Amazon Prime/Youtube.\n\nAnother nice benefit is having wifi coverage on the patio. Due to having one of the devices in the basement, I get great coverage sitting on the patio. Now when we're outside grilling or sitting around a fire, I can stream music via Wifi and not use my Cell Data.\n\nHopefully I'll still be happy with the product in 6 months. Fingers crossed.\n\nI like being able to turn off the LED lights on the device. This would come in handy if you happened to have one in a bedroom.",

So, I accepted the spotty coverage throughout the house and the slow connections to devices. Was I annoyed? YES, but I knew it was the best available, so I put up with the crummy service from the router.\n\nI\u2019ve had my eye on upgrading for years now and I finally melted down because the poor coverage of my Asus router and started looking for a mesh system. I started by researching the major brands and didn\u2019t like the mixed reviews I was seeing. So complicated with lots of criticism of tech support told me that most of the systems out there have problems and you need to call tech support\u2026 Not what I needed right now.\n\nEnter TaoTronics Mesh Wifi router. Compared to other brands the feedback and user experience outwardly seemed rigged. I must admit I was suspicious, but I bought their 3-unit system for my home. It arrived quickly and I found the units to be stylish and fitting for home d\u00e9cor. I followed directions to a tee and my install was very easy. I won\u2019t get in the bit-n-bite of the install because it was just as easy as following their simple directions.\n\nHolly smokes, you\u2019re going to love this unit\u2019s performance! It 100% exceeded my expectations for speed and coverage. And one more thing\u2026 Their mobile app they have is a dream to use by comparison to the clunky interfaces of old. Simple, straight forward and easy to use.\n\nBottom line\u2026 Get this system and save yourself money over the name brands while getting performance and coverage you\u2019ll be amazed with.",

As it was still under the 2 year warranty, I contacted the manufacturer. Customer service was ok; they sent me a new power adapter but that didn't work (as they probably knew it wouldn't, based on other similar reviews that this product is going dead in a year). So then they sent me a \"new, thoroughly tested unit\". Set the next one up, and guess what? Just a month shy of a year, the unit fried again (same awful burning rubber smell). Only this time customer service REFUSED to honor the warranty as they said my original purchase (in 2019) was 2 days over the 2 year warranty. I tried to explain that the replacement unit (received in 11/2020) should be covered with the same 2 yr warranty but they said no and offered to \"repair my unit at a reasonable cost to ME\" or give me a \"30% discount\" on a new one.  I declined and instead bought the Orbit 57946 B-hyve Smart 6-Zone Indoor/Outdoor Sprinkler Controller instead. Glad I did; the Orbit controller has a much more advanced digital display and interface...and it cost me the same as the NxEco. Would NOT recommend you waste your time and money with this NxEco product as it is NOT built to last.",

Still works well and does the job. App still crashes a lot but Android phones allow to FORCE close it without needing to log on again.  Customer technical support is very fast and attentive.

                "review_body": "I bought this to replace an 5 year old WRT-54G.\nThe device looks slick ... but it's in a cabinet ...\nAs always easy setup with Linksys devices. I am glad I read about the local vs. web based setup before I installed it because it was confusing at first.\n\nThe throughput is much better than the previous router. I don't have numbers but everybody in the house (3 teenagers!# happily streams Netflix and hulu etc. and I still have bandwidth for my work.\n\nThe previous Linksys routers all had decent parental controls. I could create rules and activate them based on time. This device has extremely rudimentary controls. Essentially not usable. You can't block multiple devices or multiple sites at the same time. The control allow the user to pick on/off times for each rule on a nifty time grid, but each rule can only affect one device or one website.\n\nThe connected device manager is an improvement over previous versions but it still could be better. I have devices show up multiple times #same MAC#. Some devices don't show up #only 4 of 5 Sonos components show up). I like that I can name each device and give it icons.\n\nI really like the GuestNet feature. Super easy to set up. Your guest just connect to your network and automatically get asked a password (which you can set, and which is NOT your regular Wifi password) and they're connected to the internet but NOT your network. I like this for three reasons: 1) I can change my guest network if I'm worried about neighbors or WiFi hijackers. 2) I can make my regular WiFi password much more complicated and thus stronger because my guests don't have to type it in; and 3) My guests can't get access to my files so I can remove one level of password protection from my networked computers. This is a great feature.\n\nThings I would like to see improved:\nThe web interface is incompatible with IE11 !!! Had to re-install Google Chrome!!!\nThe interface WAN speed check app is iPad incompatible! It's flash based.\nThe parental controls need to be improved. I would like to see the ability turn multiple devices or websites on and off at different times. Then I would like to see a master list of rules with an on/off button next to them. I have three daughters each with a computer, phone and ipod. Each has different needs for internet access because their school times are different and website access and times are different for different ages.\nThe speed check utility needs to run on ipads.\nThe device list manager needs to work more reliably, i.e. show all devices and then only once.\nI would really like to see a network map.\nGuest Network is great! I would love to see an email notification service so I get emails when guest sign in or out. Similar to my NAS sending me error messages.\n\nOverall I think this is a well functioning device. I am a very advanced and picky user. I have had good luck and experience with Linksys and cisco hardware. I have not really found better parental controls. I hope Linksys can improve that some.",

                "review_body": "Bought this EA4500 to replace an old WRT54GS. I use linux (Ubuntu 12.04).  I *did not* use the Cisco Connect software at all. Never even took the CD out of the packet.  Just plugged it in to a spare network port on my linux box which DHCP'd and came up fine. Pointed my Firefox browser at [...] and immediately got the familiar old interface with lots of new goodies. 7th heaven. After setup, it worked fine. My one N capable box ran at 150 mbps downloading a big file. Really!  19 Mbytes/sec. Faster than the 100mbps *wired* connection! (from a box with a 1 gbps wired connection). My other 2 wireless boxes also connected fine. Perhaps better then the old WRT.  Caveat: I don't stress the range on my small premises.  Did not try the 5ghz band at all.\n\nThen I made a HUGE MISTAKE. I pushed the button to upgrade the firmware from 2.0.? to 2.1.38.138143. This is just too convenient. What could go wrong? And right there is the button to revert to the previous firmware ...\n\nAfter doing this, you can't even connect directly to the router anymore with a web browser.  Instead, you MUST go through something called ciscocloudconnect.com.  You MUST setup an account there before you can even talk to your router!  Well actually you can get *limited* access to it if you unplug from the internet first. Just enough to piss you off.  So now the *only* way to change anything but the most basic configuration items via the web interface is to do it essentially from the outside in by going through this ciscocloudconnect.com.  Is that secure?  Well, it certainly opens some sort of hole from the outside. And you have to give your router password to Cisco. I am *sure* they store it away safely right?\n\nPerhaps the Cisco Connect software (not to be confused with Cisco Cloud Connect) can do more in this situation, but I couldn't try it since Cisco doesn't support linux.\n\nThis new interface is also just plain dumbed down. There is no other way to describe it.\n\nAND to top it all off, while the original 2.0.? firmware had an option to revert to the previous firmware, that option is GONE in the new firmware. There is no way to go back (confirmed by 2 Cisco Tech Reps).\n\nI cannot comment on possible benefits of Cisco Cloud Connect. It might be handy for some people who aren't anal about security.\n\nBottom line:  If you like the old fashioned, well designed, functional web interface and you don't want obscure holes punched in your firewall and you don't want to give your router password to Cisco and you are lucky enough to have an EA4500 with the 2.0.? firmware, then don't upgrade it, and turn off the \"automatic upgrade\" switch. Of course if that firmware turns out to be buggy then all us old crocs are out of luck with Linksys routers.\n\nBack to Amazon for an exchange. Hoping the 2nd one has the older firmware.  Thank you Amazon!\n\nUPDATE: 1 day after I posted this review, Cisco/Linksys responded via Amazon and added the original firmware (2.0.36) and an update (2.0.37) as well as the Cloud Connect firmware (2.1.38) in the Download tab of their EA4500 support page. They also added rollback instructions for those who don't like the new firmware.  I was able to rollback my original router to 2.0.37 and when my replacement arrived with the initial firmware (2.0.36) I was able to upgrade it to 2.0.37 which appears to be just some bug fixes.\n\nTheir customer support never did get back to me. I guess an Amazon review gets their attention more then a call to India.\n\nWith 2.0.36 the router seemed to work fine for me, but I have only a couple of days on it so far. Just upgraded to 2.0.37 now, so no experience to report. I am hoping that the newly alleged \"Big Brother\" monitoring only occurs with the Cloud Connect firmware, but I can't confirm that.",

                "review_body": "Setting up the router is about as easy as it gets.  I could explain it here, but it's really not much more than plugging it in and running the setup program on the included CD.  You get a random network name, and have both secured and unsecured wireless capabilities that it separates out into different VLANs.  One note about the random network name, if you reset the router, you will get a new network name.  I found that out the hard way, when I had to reset it when troubleshooting a wireless network issue (which may not have had anything to do with the router, itself).\n\nI gave it a 5 star rating for range, but in truth, I'm not sure what the total range is.  I do know that I lose a bar (in my Dell laptop, using the built-in wireless... as well as my wife's iTouch) when I go upstairs (router is set up in the basement).  I get a good signal throughout the house, and on the back patio.  For me, the range is plenty good, and the speed is plenty fast for browsing the Internet and sending e-mail.  I haven't tried networking games via the wireless yet, nor have I tried streaming high-def content to my blu-ray player or Xbox 360.  Still need adapters to get those up and running on the network.\n\nThe gigabit backplane is nice, as well, since I plan on purchasing a NAS for my home office that I'll be backing up to.  100mb speed is just too slow for backups of large amounts of data.\n\nAdvanced settings are easy to get to and set.  To play with these, you'll want to at least have a clue about basic networking before diving in.  I've looked at it, but haven't yet had a need to customize any settings.  I'm sure that will change, but the basic installation through the gui will do the trick for most users.\n\nAll in all, I'm pleased with the router.  I really like the dual band capability and what that brings to the table.  I love having a guest network.  Note that this network is password protected, and you need to select it then open a browser on your laptop which redirects to a page that allows you to put in the password to your guest network... only then are you able to use this network.  This was a gotcha for me early on, probably because I didn't read the manual.  ;)  The guest network is separated from your secured network.\n\nThe wireless seems pretty dependable, overall.  I have experienced few drop-outs, though some drop-outs seem to be the rule, rather than the exception when it comes to wireless connectivity, and to be honest, I'm not certain that the drop-out is on the router side, either.  This will become more obvious one way or the other as I \"plug in\" more wireless devices into the network.\n\nYou can get a less expensive router, but most don't have dual bands that run concurrently.  Many don't have a guest network built into it.  And many aren't nearly as easy to set up.  While more and more newer models include a gigabit backplane, if you go for a cheaper model, you're not likely going to get this, either.  I guess it all depends on your budget and needs.  For my future wireless plans, this was a good purchase, and worth the extra money.",

                "review_body": "The AC1750 is a good entry 802.11AC router with dual band (2.4 & 5 GHZ) support. As I looked at buying this there were a few things that were most important to me. Range, speed, setup ease and dual band performance. So, I'll try to cover each in the review.\n\nRange - I have the router setup on the top shelf on the first floor of my home which is about 3300q ft. I receive the 2.4 GHZ signal throughout the house (3 levels) and well into the back and front yards. That's the good part and better than expected/needed. Unfortunately the 5 Ghz range is not so good. I can receive the signal as long as I remain in the center of the house but wander out of the center and the signal drops off quickly. Outside of the house, no 5Ghz signal. I have to say I expected it to cover at least the entire first floor and much of the second. I'd give it 2 stars on range only because the 2.4 range is better than my old router.\n\nSpeed - When you can get a 5Ghz signal it rocks. I just did a speed test and had 61M down and 12M upload on wifi. On 2.4 it was 48M download and 10M up. Really good considering my old router was at 32 and 9. Quite a speed boost. theoretical 450 Mbps on the 2.4 GHz band and 1300 Mbps at 5 GHz are stated to be achievable through the routers 5 antennas. But theoretical and real life are far different as you can see. Given the real life boost I experienced, it's 5 stars for speed.\n\nSet-up- It comes with a CD that will walk you through setup. When I say walk I mean crawl. My 70 year-old mom could follow this one with only 1 or 2 phone calls to me. So, for me, a bit tedious but for most beginners great. The entire setup process took exactly two minutes from connecting the router to my DSL modem to having a Macbook Pro connected to the SSID. Few consumer routers this powerful, make setup so easy. One feature that sets the AC1750 apart is the easy setup and flexible management capabilities. The cloud as management console raises the bar for router management and that capability is great. Setup is definitely 5 stars.\n\nDual band performance -A big positive about this router is that you can set the 5ghz network to broadcast only 11.ac. The speeds are much faster on the 5ghz space and 11.ac is the fastest of the available technologies so you can dedicate a network and never have it step down to a slower speed. I assume that's why the 5ghz speed was much better. in the speed test The downside is that slower N and lower devices will only connect to 2.4ghz. But I felt the speed was worth the trade-off. Of course, you can set it up differently.\n\nTo wrap it up, 5 stars for everything except 5ghz range. Understand that 5ghz will never travel as far as 2.4 but it should reach more than 25 - 30 feet from the router. So, overall 4-stars.\n\nI hope you find this helpful!",

                "review_body": "Just got the router (Linksys 1750, EA6500, V2)\nThese are my first impressions. Very easy installation - as easy I have seen. Took maybe 1 minute to go through the setup. Connect the router, navigate to lynksissmartwifi.com (local to the router) and follow the prompts.\nThe speed in the same room for the 2.4Ghz channel was 40-50MB/s. Now is 55-60MB/s. Interestingly the speed did not increase on the second floor - it is still 25MB/s to 30MB/s. This is the reason I purchased it in the first place but did not seem to increase the speed there. We will see if the speed increases as I explained below for the my testing in the room where the router is (this is why I give it 4 stars for now and not 5).\nAnother interesting fact is that first time the speed test was very disappointing - about 10MB/s (lower then with my old router which was showing about 40MB/s). However with a few more tries it kept increasing until reaching the max of 55-60MB/s. So currently the speed is 10-15 BM/s higher then with the old router. Not sure if this is by design.\nTesting the speed in the same room at the 5GHz channel - it started at 50-60MB/s the first test but kept increasing and is now reading 130MB/s.\nNot sure if this is from router or my internet provider (have not tested direct connection with the modem).\nSo this is double than my previous router (that did not have 5GHz channel).\nThe router tends to run warm but not hot (for now). I will be watching it being aware of what other users said about overheating.\nCouple other interesting facts - the Lynksis testing software tends to show higher numbers than when I use Speedtest.net. Not sure why.\n\nOverall very good experience so far. Will update as I continue using it.\n\nBy the way nothing on the box says V2. But it listed the USB3 port which I think is the difference between V1 and V2. So I am pretty sure I got V2.\n\nDay 2\nOk so did some more speed testing today and amazingly my 2.4 Ghz channel now has gone to 75-90MB/s (from the 50-60MB/s it was showing on day one). The 5Ghz channel still reads ~130MB/s. Not sure if these are daily variations from my ISP, Xfinity, but this is pretty amazing, compare to the maximum of 40MB/s I was getting with my old Belkin Surf N300 router (even in the same room with the router).\nThe router continues to run warm but not hot.\nMy iPad 2 is the only device I have still stack at 20-25MB/s (but it may be limitation of the iPad design).\nI am upgrading my review to 5 stars.\n\nUpdate about 5 days later.\nThe router continues to run very well. However checking the temperature shows that the bottom is pretty hot. Seems the metal plates on the top and bottom are heat sinks. The one on the bottom is much hotter than the one on the top and a little too hot for comfort.\nBefore getting a laptop cooling pad to put under the router I decided to just elevate it on a stand I have around (about 2 inches above the ground) that allows the free flow of air below the router. That seems to help to decrease the temperature. Right now even the bottom feels warm but not too hot. Will wait and see if this keeps it at comfortable temperature (although I am not sure what the right temperature needs to be)",

                "review_body": "I purchased this router from Amazon.com last week and it arrived in less than two days using the free ground shipping method, so kudos to Amazon for setting the bar very high and exceeding my delivery expectations.\n\nI received a WRT610N version 2 (v2) router. I installed the router in the exact same physical wiring configuration as my existing router which it replaced. Then I popped in the CD in my computer and ran the setup.exe and clicked next through all of the useless wiring diagrams which I had already done. Turned on the router when it asked me to, helped me setup network names for both 2.4ghz and 5ghz frequency, router password, and wpa2 encryption on each radio frequency in just minutes. Cisco Network Magic was also installed which can prove to be a useful tool to use but it's not essential in my opinion. There's nothing that I can't manually configure in my router that Cisco Network Magic requires a paid software license to do for you through an application interface and system service. Either way, I'll use it until the free trial expires.\n\nI was up and running in about 10 minutes using two laptops wirelessly to the network and several hardwired devices. I also followed the advice of some other users and changed the wireless configuration to change the radio band on the Linksys WRT610N router from Auto to the Wide-40mhz channel (for the 5ghz network only, leaving the 2.4ghz wireless network setting to Auto-20mhz channel). In the web interface under the wireless menu, you can switch to \"manual\" to input these settings. I use the 5ghz spectrum for one of my laptops which I use as a wireless media server on my network to stream content to my PS3 using MediaMall's PlayOn software which I highly recommend (and it no longer hiccups while streaming data wirelessly to the router since I'm now using wireless-N instead of wireless-G as well as using the 5ghz spectrum).\n\nAlso, I had to buy a dual-band half mini PCIe card for this laptop so that I could use wireless-N on the 5ghz spectrum since my laptop only came with a 802.11b/g half mini PCIe card. You will not find half mini PCIe cards at retail brick & mortar stores. After some research, I went with the Intel Wifi Link 5300 chipset half mini PCIe card(this does not work on all laptops, read the specifications on Intel's website as to which system board chipsets it supports. Also note if your laptop uses a mini PCIe form factor or HALF mini PCIe form factor as mine does. You can get this information from the laptop manufacturer if you are unsure). Since my laptop also only had two antenna leads built in and the Intel 5300 dual-band half mini PCIe card had a 3rd lead, I installed a Tyco mini PCIe antenna that I purchased from Ebay for under $3.00. This allows my PCIe card to more efficiently utilize MIMO on the router and increase my signal strength and throughput.\n\nFor most of you, you might just prefer to use an external PCMCIA, Express card, or USB dongle to accomplish this task (and most dual-band cards already have 3 internal antennae). As for me, I wanted to have everything built into the laptop directly so there is nothing hanging out the sides. It's simply a preference. If you go with PCMCIA/Express/USB dongle, you can disregard the paragraph above.\n\nOverall, I give this router 5 stars for ease of use and performance increases over my previous 802.11g connection. I will post my old and new router wired and wireless speed test results in the upcoming weeks.",

                "review_body": "Linksys BEFW11S4 - I received this unit from my wife for Christmas in 2001.  I had it connected to my cable modem on the 26th.  The documentation was a little sparse, but I was able to get the thing going pretty quick.\nWhen I first had it set up, I was able to see the internet on all my machines, but they could not see each other.  Turns out having Windows XP Professional on all the computers was part of my problem...File sharing and permissions have to be set up correctly for the computers to share their info.  Let's blame that one on pilot error :-)  Visiting Microsoft's ExpertZone for networking tips led me down the correct path.\n\nI encountered troubles on my second day of ownership when my Cable Modem provider, Comcast, switched over to their own service from @Home (Which is going bankrupt).  I was still able to see my network in the house: One laptop with a wireless PC card from Orinoco, my desktop which was connected to the router directly, and my daughter's desktop downstairs in the kitchen with a Linksys Wireless USB adapter (See my review on that puppy, awesome) So I knew the issue was in one of my new settings with Comcast's distribution of IP addresses.\nGoing into the setup, I found that even though I had told the router to obtain an IP address automatically, it would not, or could not.  It just told me my WAN address was 0.0.0.0  Not a good address for the `net.\nHooking my cable modem directly to my computer instantly allowed me to obtain an IP address and Internet connectivity.  I used IPCONFIG in a command prompt to get my new IP address, then went into my Network Connections to get my physical address (MAC address) of my network card.\nI then hooked up my router to the computer and the cable modem to the router.  I used the Linksys control screen advanced settings to clone my network card's MAC address (In case Comcast needed the actual address of the card they supplied).  I then manually entered the IP address and DNS I found earlier with IPCONFIG and Network Connections.  Bingo, I was on the `net, through my router.\nKnowing my IP address said the lease was set to expire in one week, I didn't want to wait a week and have to do this all over again.  So I reset the Router to obtain an IP address automatically, and powered down my entire computer, cable modem included.\nPowering back up, the router found a new IP address, and my entire network of three computers was set up and running on the Internet.  I am not sure if spoofing my MAC address was really necessary, but I left it as is and the network runs great.  Wireless is the way to go if you can spare the extra money when compared to pulling wires.  I get about 5 Mb/sec connectivity from my daughters desktop down ion the kitchen one floor down, while the Linksys router is upstairs in my office.  I get the same for my laptop when I am down on the couch in the living room.  When it warms up here in New Jersey I'll think of heading into the yard with the laptop to check on connectivity range outside the house.\nRonGoltsch at Hotmail dot com",

                "review_body": "This router replaced my old G+ MIMO router from Linksys.  The old one was just having issues freezing up and had to be re-booted at least once a week.  I bought this one on recommendation from a friend, and so far, it has met my every expectation... save one... RANGE!\n\nThe router out of the box is easy to set up, and activating/deactivating the 5GHz channel is as easy as adding or removing a check-mark.  I left the 5GHz channel running so I could get the benefits at close range, but very few of my devices support 5GHz, so I may change that channel back to 2.5GHz and be done with it.  The good news is that all my laptops, etc. have excellent data speeds now, even at 2.5GHz!\n\nMy biggest complaint thus-far is range.  My old G+ was in the same location, but I could get good signal nearly anywhere on my property (even the gazebo ~100' away from the house).  Not so much with this router... I'm struggling to get a signal in my driveway which is one wall and 60-ft from the router, and get NOTHING at the gazebo.  Even signal in the farthest bedroom is spotty (40' and two walls).  I've called Linksys about it and they suggested moving the router to a different location, first of all, that is not easily possible, and secondly, the old one worked GREAT in that location... I'll try moving it at a later date, but if it does not make it better, I'll have to ask for a warranty replacement, as I feel something is wrong with this unit.  I'll update this review afterwards.\n\nUPDATE:\nAfter speaking with Cisco support via phone and chat several times, regarding channel settings, etc., I've played with settings until I've found a channel combination that seems to work much better for my home.  I've disabled the 5GHz (switched it to 2.4GHz), running dual-band 2.4Ghz, and also re-enabled the 5Ghz band in my quest for better range.  I've continued to tweak channels and found two channel combinations that seem to provide better range for my wireless devices.  If you have range issues with this router, switch the channel selection from \"Auto\", and give each channel and frequency a test to see what works best for your home/business.  It will take a little effort, but if \"Auto\" is not working for you, this is the best option for finding the best range and speed (reduction of interference).\n\nI still like the router, and Cisco/Linksys customer support has been great to work with, but honestly, out of the box, I expected better function and range... and right now, I'm still not getting the range I received from my old WRT110 G+ router.  Yes, the router is a good router (no crashes, lockups, bottlenecks, etc.), speed is better than my old router (wired or wireless), but range is still not in my \"happy-zone\".  Raised review to 4-stars from three, because of customer support help, and the fact that it does work!",

                "review_body": "I reviewed this product on Linksys own site.  However, they did not see fit to publish it.  Judge for yourself, this is the review I submitted:\n\n\"Needed to replace my WRT54G which was dropping my wireless connections as I was adding more of them. Purchased a WRT3200 which looked like a perfect replacement. I like the looks of that unit, it looks like a bigger WRT54G with all of the status lights in front and the same general appearance. However, it turns out that the WRT3200 will not downgrade to WEP/WAP. In my case, I have a number of WET54G and WAP54G (configured as a wireless bridge) units on my network. They primarily connect data collection devices such as weather data. I'm not overly concerned about the lower level of security that WEP/WAP provides in this case. I did not want to have to replace all of these bridges. Returned the WRT3200 and purchased the EA7500 instead. The WET54G bridges worked fine with the EA7500, however, Linksys tech support told me the WAP54G unit will not work with the EA7500. I found an inexpensive IOGEAR GWU627 Wi-fi N adapter to replace the WAP54G. The GWU627 works great. The EA7500 has performed well so far. I have the unit's back facing the front so I can see the status lights. With the WRT3200 you get to see them on the front. Also, the EA7500 does not have the eSATA port or USB3 like the WRT3200. It does have two USB2 ports. I connected a hard drive to one of them just to see it working. Haven't decided if I'll actually make use of them as I already have a NAS device. I don't have an opinion on the dual band functionality as I found that none of my wireless devices can connect on 5Gz. The EA7500 is an improvement over of my WRT54G. My wireless connections appear solid. One thing I didn't like in this process was the tech support from Linksys. Of the four tech supports with which I communicated, only one did not have an accent. One of them spoke with such a heavy accent, I had to virtually get her to repeat everything twice. Also, the Linksys tech support appears to want to push new/replacement products more than finding a solution to the problem. Also, they assume you have a low technical knowledge and will try to tell you tell you things that technically are not entirely true or irrelevant for the problem in hand, that is, suggesting costly equipment upgrades rather than a cost effective solution to the problem.\"\n\nI am so glad I purchased my router through Amazon.  I was able to return the WRT3200 with absolutely no problem.  The return and my purchase of the EA7500 was accomplished within a week.  All I got from Linksys was a hassle,  all of their offers/solutions would have cost me more money.",

In last 7 minths I have tested several aspects of this router and no wonder it is still at almost same price and a top-seller. Here is my review:\n\nSetup & install: Super smooth, simple, and easy, no hiccups at all.\n\nGuest Access: You can create a guest network separate with a simple password (optional) when you have visitors. You need not to share the password of your own network. You can turn on or off the guest network whenever you wish.\n\nConnecting to the network: CISCO Connect is a great tool to manage your network. It makes a USB drive which once inserted in to any computer can set it up on your network.\n\nDual Band Networking: E3000 provides you two separate networks. One on 2.4GHZ and one on 5GHZ. 5GHZ band is less crowded and hence is better for streaming online content. Keep in mind that not all devices are equipped with a 5GHZ receiver/wireless adapters. Most notebooks have only 2.4GHZ adapters. However, media streaming devices like Blu Ray players (",

                "review_body": "I bought this Linksys WRT54GL router to use purely as a Wireless Access Point on my existing wired network.  The process was simple (in general terms, don't connect anything to its WAN port, give it a new IP address, turn off its DHCP Server, and set its wireless values) and the results great (excellent connectivity throughout my house).  My wireless needs are very low (basically, a Wi-Fi connection for my Kindle and for the occasional cell phone).  So, this router (on sale) fit the bill.  Unless and until something unforeseen pops up, I'm rating this at an Excellent 5 stars out of 5.  If anyone's interested in the technical specifics of my process, here they are:\n\n- To avoid conflicting with my existing wired network, I plugged the WRT54GL into a power supply and attached the provided 5 foot long CAT5E network cable to an isolated computer via one of the numbered LAN ports (not the WAN port -- don't use that for an Access Point).\n- Upon booting up the computer, I opened my browser and went to the default router location of 192.168.1.1 (the default password is \"admin\").  This brought up the Setup | Basic Setup tab.\n- In the upper right corner, I noted that the \"Firmware Version\" was 4.30.14.  Previously, I had checked the Linksys support page and downloaded the latest firmware (4.30.15).  So, I went to the Administration | Firmware Upgrade tab and upgraded the firmware.  When that was done, I reset the WRT54GL to it's factory defaults by holding the reset pin on the back for 30 seconds.\n- My existing network router/DHCP server is at 192.168.1.251 and manages the IP range from 192.168.1.100 to 192.168.1.149.  So, once I was back at the WRT54GL's default page, I changed the \"Local IP Address\" from its 192.168.1.1 address to something within my existing subnet that wouldn't conflict (192.168.1.10).  I also Disabled the \"DHCP Server\" and set my Time Zone.  I then hit the \"Save Settings\" button at the bottom of the screen (I won't include this \"Save\" process in the rest of my bullets -- just assume it's there).\n- After it was done, I unplugged the WRT54GL from the power and the computer, and turned off the computer.  I connected the cable from the WRT54GL's numbered LAN port to a port on a switch on my wired network (a port on my router in my wired network would also work), plugged the computer back into the switch, too, and powered everything back up.\n- This time, I browsed to the WRT54GL's new address of 192.168.10, went to Administration | Management and reset my \"Router Password\" to a good, strong value.\n- On the Wireless | Basic Wireless tab, I changed the \"Wireless Network Name (SSID)\" to a good, strong value, Disabled \"Wireless SSID Broadcast\", and changed the \"Wireless Channel\" to what I wanted.\n- On the Wireless | Wireless Security tab, I set the \"Security Mode\" to \"WPA2 Personal\" and entered a good, strong \"WPA Shared Key.\"\n- That's it.  The WRT54GL now functions as a Wireless Access Point.  Since nothing's hooked to its WAN port and its DHCP Server is disabled, all the IP addressing for everything coming through the WRT54GL is handled by my wired network's router/DHCP server.",

                "review_body": "I upgrade from the notorious Linksys WRT610N Simultaneous Dual-N Band Wireless Router, since the first day setup, it only work on the same draft-N items for N speed, the G band has no problem at all; but its software setup is totally mess, I even have my IT(20 years professional Microsoft Certified, Novell, Dell authorized local specialist) to setup for me, normally I can make it work previousely in any wireless router setup myself, but this WRT610N is a totally not working product, no matter from their installation CD or Web advanced setup. I think the major reason is the draft-N, not a standard certified N band(at that time it purchased, it is still a draft-N band); eventually when it setup after couple hours screw around, call Linksys Technical support or online chat, fianlly make it work by have to manuel delete/recreate every connection TCP/IP PC or wireless Notebook, then it will work normally, but still in G band, even tablets or smart phone wi-fi connection, still in G. Been use PC for almost my life, plus 7 years in University study for Mac, Linksys/Cicso is a pretty solid reputation brand for network products, But this WRT610N make me wordering they did a lousy software drive router product(even Cnet recommend WRT610N in 2009, Editor Choice!) I alredy make up my mind this router gotta to let go, fopr so long time suffering its mild-speed connection, finally see the E4200 v2 and EA4500 coming out, E4200 v2 is earlier than EA4500, but EA4500 let you control everything to the router by smart phone app or remote reboot, this a plus! Remind all of you like to setup EA4500 router, it is an EASY, EASY, EASY, WONDERFUL process that I have ever setup for a wireless router, Compared with WRT610N and this EA4500, it is a degreed of Hell and Heaven experience. Pop CD into your PC FIRST! No need to reconnect directly from Cabel Modem or DSL to your setup PC, you can just unplug the old router network connection, after CD program shown, plus EA4500 Internet(yellow) connection, then YOU CAN PLUG your HUB SWITCH CONNECTION into 4 of 1-4 blue connections behind the EA4500(this is a totally new process than previous Linksys setup, the previous setup required Modem-Router-PC connection, it can not connect any hub connection between PC and yor Wireless couter), then let the program run, it only pop up onece to let me confirm the SSID and password of security setup, then it setup and running it all by itself, it took only 5 mins(I got i7-970 Extreme PC with SLI and 8GB ram, duel 600GB Velocity WD 10,000RPM hard drive), then IT IS DONE! Plus it will automaticlaly upgrade and firmware or update software installation. My tablets and Wifi smart phone now got better connection, 2 stories building home now can all covering plus front and back yard all can get at least 3 block of signals, but indoor, my connection are all FULL BARS! 3200 sq/ft of my home now the N speed is all functional, 450MB plus duel bands of older G band notebook, it did a major improvement of the wireless connection. My gigabit switch hub also getting better speed and my sending data for laser printer getting faster printing result. For best result, like me, a nerd with wife and 2 kids, go get the catagory 6 cable, if you want the connection really fly like mind, DO NOT USE cat5 or cat5e, IT DID SLOWING DOWN YOUR CONNECTION, all my home cables are CAT6, when I play Battlefield 3, I am always the first one spawn inside when the map start, OH, Linksys, you guys getting this product DOING RIGHT!",

                "review_body": "After reading mixed reviews I when ahead and ordered this router as I knew I could return it to Amazon without problems.\n\nAs a long time user of Linksys routers I consider them the standard to which others should be measured (a WRT54GS for 9 plus years that is working flawlessly from day one and another non wireless Linksys router before that going back to the late '90's both have served me well).\n\nI was worried about the many negative reviews - if I had problems tech support would get 1 hour of my time and one chance to solve or back the unit goes.  So far I just needed to manually install firmware update - if that is daunting to the less tech inclined then you may want to pass on this router.  Many other reviewers reported the same issue here and I updated the firmware on the other routers from time to time over the years so I can accept that.  I am unsure if I would recommend this or any EA class router for my parents for this reason and they need a new wireless router.\n\nPositives:\n1.  Works well once firmware manually updated\n2.  Apps work on iPod touch\n3.  Easy setup via CD\n4.  Great range - 110 year old 2 story house with metal roof - covers my lot and everywhere I need to go so far.\n5.  Good speed - N is going to be better than G so I cannot say much more - glad I upgraded.\n\nNegatives:\n1.  I did have to manually reset my cable modem several times in the first two days - if this problem continued daily it was going back.  The first time I could understand - new device but my cable modem is in the basement and I dislike going downstairs to reset.  The last problem I had was in fact \"the cable was out\" so it has been great after the first two days.\n2. Cheap ass short power cord from the wall wart to the unit.  I set my router on the top of a hutch/wall unit and I have a power strip mounted to the back of the desktop area to keep cords controlled and out of sight.  So the WRT54GS has a 60\"-70\" cord enabling me to grab the unit and pull it down to work on it without disconnecting it from the cable.  The EA4500 power cable is maybe 42\"-50\" - not even long enough to pull the unit to the front edge of the hutch.  This still pisses me off - for a $150+ unit you would think they would spend a few cents more to give enough cable to plug the router power supply into a wall outlet and set on top of a bookshelf for improved range - if this matters to you think twice about this router.\n3.  Runs hot but as I must climb on a chair to check so I have not be checking that often.\n\nI am still evaluating the USB connection for HDD and I have not tired the media server but will update once I get a feel for how they function.\n\nOverall it works but was it worth the premium over base models? I am unsure of so far.",

                "review_body": "First our problem, our Motorola Docsis 3.0 surfboard all in one cable modem/WiFi router was constantly needing reset (in the basement hidden in an inconvenient spot with the security dvr no less), plus Netflix and Amazon Prime were constantly rebuffering. These things drove my wife insane, we get a couple hours to unwind after the kids go to bed before we go to bed ourselves and just want stream our shows and check things out on our phones and unwind. To make things worse the kids get to lay in bed and watch tv for 1/2 hour before they sleep also, so 3 TVs streaming  2 iPhones and tablet running at once, possibly more. All but one tv (our bedroom) is Ethernet. Just the bedroom tv and 2 iphones was enough to make the tv rebuffer even with Medicom 60Mbps service. So I read some blogs and articles on fast reliable home internet systems and found I should 1.ditch the all in one modem/router for separate ones 2. Look for units with tri-bands 3. Unit that was 802.11ac 4. Mi-MIMO 5. More Ethernet ports and lots of data streams. I also remembered old blue Linksys routers I had in the past being 100% reliable 100% of the time and thought I\u2019m going Linksys this time around. Also I read a C-Net (I think anyway) article that said it is foolish to not consider buying factory refurbished modems and routers so I did (Amazon certified as well for safe measure). I got this Linksys top of the line (2017) router and an Arris SB6190 near top of the line (2017) cable modem for about half price. We could not be happier! Set up was super easy (my 70 year old Mom could do it, really), the speeds checked by my IPhone went from old all in one of 4 o 5 mbps to now consistant 80-120 mbps (faster than we pay for oddly), but better no rebuffering even at our busy times, all across our system. Amazing in my book! We did buy the Linksys AC1900 seamless WiFi range extender that lets you use the same password and address all across the house since even with all it\u2019s 8 fancy antennas it\u2019s range was a little less than the old Motorola all in one (wth?) we did have a range extender on the old one just for the deck, patio and garage but this one needed it for those spaces plus better signal in far corners inside. But no worries or reduced stars as this is remarkable and a must buy if it\u2019s in your router budget. A note on the AC1900 range extender we connected wirelessly knowing it reduces speeds (1/3 less in our home anyway) but do plan on running an Ethernet cable to it for full speeds across the house soon. We also separated our faster and slower devices and gadgets to different bands (easy to do with the app) I read old 802.11n or g devices slow an entire band compared to 802.11ac?, not sure if it\u2019s true but easy enough to do with this set up. Also old modem counted on Medicom to upgrade the firmware (if they even supported it which I couldn\u2019t find out) and me an average guy didn\u2019t know how to go online and into it to do it manually but this one can be done quite intuitively through the app. I intentionally didn\u2019t get into specs as they are available everywhere. I hope this helps the average joe or jane with a  family and lots of devices.",

                "review_body": "The reason I bought the router was mainly that I wanted to upgrade from my Netgear Wireless-G router because it just wasn't built for gaming. So I purchased this router and I must say that it is impressive, but the router isn't as small as I had hoped, but it doesn't look clunky or out of place either. This router can go anywhere in your home because it doesn't take up that much space at all. This is basically one of the best looking routers I have seen despite it being a tad bigger than my old router.\n\nThe setup was simple, but not without any hiccups. Before I began to setup the router itself, I turned off my modem and my desktop. After I had everything plugged in I turned on my modem and let it establish its connection and then I fired up the router and also let it establish a connection with my modem. First, I tried running the setup disc that the router comes with from my MacBook Pro (running OS X Lion version 10.7.2). Unfortunately, I was receiving a message saying that I was not running the current Mac operating system even though I am running the latest one. I read the box and it seems that the setup disc is compatible with OS X Leopard, Tiger, Snow Leopard but OS X Lion wasn't listed. So I just ran the setup  through my desktop running Windows XP and it worked without a problem. From the setup disc you can change the SSID as well as the password to your network. Also, you can change the parental controls, guest account settings, attach new devices, etc from this setup disc.\n\nThe guest network feature is very useful since guests won't be able to fool around with your router settings via HTTP interface. Something to note, the only way to change the guest account password is to do it from the setup disc that the router comes with.\n\nAfter I had everything setup, I wanted to test the new router especially for gaming over Xbox Live. Unsurprisingly, my old router (Netgear WGR614 Wireless-G Router) wasn't able to handle a direct connection with my PC and Xbox 360 simultaneously and usually the PC would stop connecting to the internet. My download speed with my old router was about 15 mbps and after connecting the Cisco-Linksys E3000 my download speed went to 20-25 mbps over wifi and close to 40 mbps when connected directly to the router (ISP: Comcast). This router can handle a direct connection from both my PC and Xbox 360 simultaneously without a problem. Like I said, I have my Xbox 360 and PC connected directly to the router and my wireless devices include 3 laptops, 3 mobile devices, a Wii, and another Xbox 360 connecting wirelessly. I am glad that I did not have to go through customer service with Linksys or Comcast for my setup as I saw some other reviewers do, but I will see if any problems arise in the coming months. I have also heard of overheating problems that reviewers have commented on. I must admit that the router does get warm, but not it doesn't overheat where it causes a router shuts down or interferes with the wireless connection (Note: I have my router running 24 hours a day).\n\nEverything seems to be running smoothly so far, but this has only been the first few days of owning this router. Since this is the case, I will update this review in a few months to report any problems that arise if any. Hopefully this router still goes strong after several months and lasts me longer then my Netgear router.",

                "review_body": "I purchased this router to replace a previous Linksys Wireless-G router that had gone on the fritz.\n\nWhile this new router looks sleek, I have to admit I was a bit skeptical of its performance.  The device definitely looks like it had gone the way of the cheap build of Netgear devices, and I worried that it would last as long as the router I was replacing (seems everything is getting disposable these days).\n\nFortunately, my skepticism is wrong.\n\nThis router has been a fantastic replacement only making me regret I didn't replace my old router sooner.  I worried a bit about its lack of antenna, but the range isthe same if not better when I look at it in G mode (all of my devices are G-mode devices) compared to the previous router. Unfotunately, the power seems a little weaker, but not enough to really affect my use as I am on a 6MPBs Internet connection  that really isn't affected by my computerworking at a little less than its 54 MBPs rating. Fortunately, I do get the full power for my streaming devices, which are probably most network intensive.\n\nThe setup of the router is 1000 times better than what I remember with my previous device.  I remember having a hard time as the previous router required a wired computer, and my ISP's tricky method of sending an IP address that essentially matches the default most routers used made that old router take 8 hours to set-up and a lot of customer support calls, hacking, etc to change the address of the router (a Linksys flaw at that time).\n\nFast forward a few years, and the device and its software essentially self-set itself without needing a direct computer connection.  The software Linksys provides is likely adequate for most home users, although limits the ability to customize things.  Fortunately, most customization can still be obtained by browsing directly to the router, and all of the typical cutomizable features (security, ports, etc) are there.\n\nThe router has now run for nearly a year with only one drop-out.  The only issue I've had (and it isn't a bad one) is the firewall can sometimes throw a fit and not let one of my devices through when its on.  Apparently, that device when updated changes its signature enough that I need to open the firewall to let it in and then unblock its port before resetting the firewall.  This is a bit of a hassle that I can't really blame directly on the router or the device (probably a bit of both).\n\nUltimately, I think this device is good enough for what it does.  It is the middle of the road model that doesn't interfere with my phone lines and will likely last longer for me than its predecessor did.",

                "review_body": "I have had Linksys WRT54GL wireless routers for many years (these are the previous version, the routers with two antennas) and I have deployed them for lots for friends.\nIn general it has been a good wireless router but the number of maximum NAT rules has been always an issue, at least for me.\nWell, perhaps it was time to upgrade to the EA3500 / N750 and enjoy the 8003.11.n capabilities.\n\nI purchased it and installed with some problems and it has been operational for about 2 months.\nIn my experience, if you have a good and operational WRT54GL Linksys you should ONLY think of upgrading if:\n\n- Your need to create more rules than what your WRT54GL allows you to.\n- You want to enjoy the 803.11n speeds at home (803.11n is basically useless connecting to the internet, ISPs just don't provide those speeds for home customers).\n- IF you don't have any of these needs, don't bother buying this router, there is nothing better in it.\n\nIn my experience, I have actually found more disadvantages than advantages. Some of them are really concerning:\n\n- The new EA3500 / N750 no longer offers the built-in Remote Management option and the ability to change the remote management port. To me that was a great advantage because I didn't need to have ports open (such as RDP), instead, I'll connect from work to my home router and open the port just for the time I'll need it and then disabling it, preventing hackers from brute-force guessing. With the new EA3500 / N750, you need to create an account in this website: Cisco/Linksys Smart Fi-Wi. You cannot connect to your router directly; instead you have to do it via this website. Why do I need to have another account? Also, why is this website becoming the man-in-the-middle between customers and their home routers? Furthermore, Cisco/Linksys now has the username and password to connect to my home router, there is no other way, I talk to two tech support engineers it is what it is. Do you really know what this means? It means that Cisco has a database that contains usernames and password for every Linksys router of users that needed to setup remote access to their routers.\n\n- The EA3500 / N750 has a poor parental control settings. In the previous model you had the ability to restrict 10 Internet Policies, each one of them could be activated or not and applicable to different days or hours. You could also edit the computers these policies apply to, block specific services (protocols) and/or URLs with them. Really fantastic. But with the new EA3500 / N750 these options have been reduced. First you cannot apply policies to the entire network, only to specific hosts, you can allow or deny access to the internet (per computer) and block URLs. So the policies are gone, the computers per policy are gone; the protocols per policy are gone as well. Bummer!\n\nIn summary, if you have a good operating WRT54GL don't buy the EA3500 / N750, Cisco has ruined a good product and successfully managed to get their hands onto the credentials of thousands of home routers.\n\n==============================================================\nUpdate: Mar/26\n\nI have found a kind reply to my post from a Linksys support specialist. Thank you!\nToday I decided to downgrade the device's firmware hoping that I'll get the same interface I had before (with the WRT54GL wireless router) and being finally able to get rid of my account with Cisco Smart Wi-Fi account. I truly would be happy if Cisco doesn't keep my home router credentials.\n\nIf you want to revert the interface, then this is your link: [...] (if while posting my review Amazon will take it, then you can find it on my comments as well).\n\nThe process was very simple, download the previous firmware and the just perform a firmware upgrade from the device. 2 minutes after, you'll have your previous interface restored and to be honest the upgrade process retained all of my settings. I cannot deny that I was very happy.... But!!!!\n\nWith kids around the house, the first thing I wanted to do is to block a number of websites and restrict their gaming websites only to weekends. Also I don't want to block all the computers, just some. With the previous WRT54GL that was possible and easy.\n\nWell, to my surprise and even with the previous interface, the Parental Control are so reduced that the downgrading doesn't really buy you anything. Linksys why did the Parental Controls were significantly reduced?? These are home wireless routers and parents quite often need to enable them.\n\nLet's take a closer look. I have an interface open to the new router on my screen as well the interface to an old router while I'm writing this update:\n\nPARENTAL CONTROLS (Access Restrictions):\nWRT54GL (Old):\n- 10 Internet Policy Access\n- Ability to enable and disable each one of them\n- You can add or remove PCs to each one of these policies, maximum flexibility.\n- Option to configure every day or specific days per policy.\n- Option to configure times per policy.\n- Option to block services: DNS, ping, HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, POP3, IMAP, etc. per policy!\n- Option to define non-standard ports, per policy.\n- Web site blocking by URL per policy\n- Web site blocking by keyword per policy.\n\nEA3500 (this new Linksys device):\n- 1 list of target devices (you can add or remove).\n- Time: You can choose the time of the day these computers will have or not access to internet.\n- Block specific sites: You can add a list of URLs you want to block.\n\nWell, I guess the difference is very obvious, isn't it?\n\nIf you are a parent and you are expecting this device to help you with your battle of keeping your kids away from all the harms from the internet as the predecessor router did (the WRT54GL) then you will be very disappointed.\nDropping Parental Control features was a really bad idea.\n\nI guess the only think that the downgrade process bought me is the ability to access the router directly without this Cisco Smart Wi-Fi website.",

                "review_body": "Works great after 3 hours of setup.\n\nRan the connection utility.  At the end, it said my setup did not complete.  However, I found I could connect to the internet (so something must have worked) where I found instruction to disable my virus-software-provided firewall.  I did that and ran the setup again with the same result.\n\nIn an effort to see what went wrong, I tried to connect directly to the router with the default adress (192.168.1.1) but the address was not to be found (I was now connected with a cable).  I went back to web support and found instructions on how to find the correct IP address.  Sure enough, it now had a different IP address.  So now I connected to this new address but the default login (none) and password (admin) did not allow me access.  Apparently these had been changed too.  I ran the connection software again with the same result.  I did a hard reset (the kind with a toothpick).\n\nNow, starting over from scratch, I ran the connection software for at least the third time and got the same result.  The only input I did was to assign the SSID name and password; these are provided for you but you are prompted to supply your own, if you wish.  In a last ditch effort, I reset the damn thing one more time and, this time, I used the default SSID and password and voila, it worked.  I was still completely disgusted but at least I didn't have to sent it back.\n\nNow I tried to direct connect to the E2500 but the default login and password would not let me in.  I don't remember if it was just a hunch or if something clued me in but I tried again using the SSID as the login name and wireless password for the the admin password and I got in.  I browsed around and changed the SSID and wireless password to my own.  After a reboot I connected wirelessly with no problem.  I direct connected again and the login and password had been changed to the new SSID and wireless password.  This is a MAJOR FLAW.  THE CONNECTION NAME AND PASSWORD SHOULD NOT BE THE SAME AS THE ADMIN LOGIN AND PASSWORD.  I did find an option to prevent administrative functions from being performed on the wireless so that helps some but be forewarned - ANYONE WHO CAN CONNECT WIRELESSLY HAS THE NAME AND PASSWORD TO LOGIN AS ADMINISTRATOR.  This may not be so bad in the home but for a business, even a small one this should NOT be ACCEPTABLE.\n\nWill I keep it?  After that much setup time invested, yes!  I works good and I have had no signal degradation problems like some others have posted; I've gotten 86-99% signal strength from 45 feet away through two walls.  I use it in my home and I disabled the wireless admin feature so I am okay with the security problem but CISCO SHOULD PROVIDE AN UPDATE TO SEPARATE THE WIRELESS AND ADMIN LOGINs.  I gave it 4 stars for the signal strength, guest connection and sturdy hardware; I should have ignored the setup software and went straight to the manual configuration via a direct-connection.",

This is a perfect cheap router for basic home use with those intents.\n\nThere are two oddities relating to the 5 GHz signal, which may or may not be related.\n1. Out of the box, the 5 GHz performance is unstable, varies wildly in speed, and sometimes slows down all the way to zero (with perfect signal strength). Changing the 5 GHz network mode to \"Wireless N only\" and the channel width to \"40 MHz only\" in the firmware settings resolves this and has resulted in fast & stable performance on the 5 GHz network as well as the 2.4 GHz network.\n\nI think (???) this may relate to the fact that...\n\n2. This router allegedly contains the same Mediatek WiFi 5 hardware as the Linksys e5400 router. That is, the hardware is capable of AC (wifi 5, 802.11AC) protocol but is \"disabled\" by firmware and sold as a cheaper router. I am honestly not sure why anyone needs faster wifi than the 5GHz wireless N, but it feels \"dirty\" to sell a router capable of going faster but disabling this possibility.\n\nHowever, out of the box, my computer WAS connecting to this router on an AC protocol, even though the box says the router doesn't use an AC protocol! I suspect that the firmware that is supposed to handicap the router is a mess and instead of simply disabling the AC protocol, it is generally effing up the 5 GHz band behavior. It is for this reason I suspect that locking the 5 GHz network to wireless N only and 40 MHz only improved performance radically over the default settings. It is no longer reporting a connection on an AC protocol but is fast and stable on the advertised 5 GHz Wireless N protocol.",

                "review_body": "I first bought the E4200 from OfficeMax.  I loved the router only to find out that their is a E4200v2 that is out.  When I had the first version E4200 the only thing I would complain about is how slow the web management is.  You click on a setting or page and then you sit and wait sometimes 20 to 40 seconds for the new page to come up.  It just gets annoying when trying to change settings quickly.  Besides that the router works awesome.  The reason I upgraded to the E4200v2 you ask.  Well I had a previous dual band high performance router which was a linksys wrt610n which I also really liked.  When I hooked up the E4200 I noticed the 5ghz band was a lot stronger than the one on my old wrt610n.  The 2.4ghz was a little better range.  So when I saw the E4200v2 with the 2.4ghz band at with 450mbps I was hoping it would give me better range on the 2.4ghz like the improvement i had on the 5ghz.  The other HUGE selling point is I saw that the E4200v2 router had an updated processor speed at 1.2ghz.  The E4200 has a processor that is built into the 2.4ghz band at 480mhz.  So not only is the E4200v2 cpu a lot faster but it also is and independent processor not built into the 2.4ghz radio band.  Once I recieved the new E4200v2 from amazon my plan was to test out both versions and keep the one that works the best.  I had the E4200 for 6 days of use and testing while I was waiting for the E4200v2.  Once I received the E4200v2 I hooked it up and the first thing I noticed was the speed of the web management.  The improved processor and forgot to mention ram pays off huge.  You click on a page and your their.  You change a setting and its done.  Anyone who uses the web management and has had to put up with slow access you will love this router.  Now on to the more important part which is the wireless coverage.  The 5ghz and 2.4ghz bands are awesome.  As I was hoping the 2.4ghz band on the v2 is stronger than the 2.4ghz on the E4200.  I have twc 50mbps download and was never able to get my computer in the den to reach the 50mbs download speed due to the wireless connection.  With my wrt610n it would get me about 20 to 30mbps down.  The E4200 did better getting about 35 to 42mbps.  The E4200v2 gives me the best as it ranges from 49 to 52mbps.  AWESOME!!!!!!!!! Oh yeah my network consist of 7 wirless devices including a ps3,nintendo wii, tablet, pc's, and cell phones.  I also have three satellite boxes hard wired to the router.  The media streaming is awesome and flawless.  The internet is super fast on every device.  And my whole house has awesome full wifi coverage.  As you probably guessed I returned the E4200 and kept the E4200v2.  Not sure what the bad reviews are about.  I would say to those people it is better to match your wifi adapter brand to your router.  For me I have all Linksys wifi adapters and a Linksys router.  Probably wouldn't get the same performance if I was using a netgear router for example.  But I will say that I have loved all the Linksys routers I have owned so far.  Which is now 4.  Thanks Cisco for another outstanding product.  Keep up the great work.",

                "review_body": "*****Update, after a week of use I started to notice dropped connections from wireless devices, just thought it was from moving around but then it started happening more frequently. Tried changing some settings to get better connections, reset router. same problem came back after a day. Going back to TP Link router, that has better firmware support.  I see one question I did not receive since my first post. if you receive a router that is set up already you can reset to factory by pushing and holding down red button on back of router until the linksys name light on top of router goes off. then release the button. this should reset the router back to factory defaults and the instructions are on linksys website to set up from there. Set up through the free app is extremely easy and faster than through a desktop/mac.\n***********************original review from day 1 week 1 of use****************4 star***********************\nFirst I will state the price of this router on Amazon is lower than all competition including directly from Linksys. This router is still selling for $299 on other sites. I had to ask why? after some digging, I took the plunge as this router still meets the needs and replaces my aging tp-link.\n  So far speed is good, I utilize the wired connection ports for gaming and home computers anyway, so I have not noticed significant issues there. Signal strength and range has improved compared to old router. The only thing I have noticed is switching automatically. I have had an issue with Iphone's selecting the best network and staying on the 2.4 channel. I can manually switch the signal so that's not the issue. Not sure if its the phone or the router though. My old router it would switch automatically.\n  Setup- super easy with their free app, can change all the security settings, when connected to the router. I did not create the cloud account to set up as this creates a security vulnerability. With security in mind please read on about best practices. and Linksys over all .\n  I have noticed 5ghz channels do not broadcast well through brick. I can pick up the 2.4ghz ok, just not as strong as expected.\n  Things to know: as other reviewers have stated, yes, the firmware support for this router is two years old now as of 2019. Why? If I had to guess, the issue is aligned with the sale of Linksys/Belkin to Foxconn. Taiwanese Foxconn attemted to secure U.S. goverment contracts by buying California Based Belkin, and planned to build a plant in Wisconsin. Google this, and see the issues that came from this venture.\n  What does this means for a 2017/early 2018 Linksys router?\n  These were the last routers produced by Former owner Belkin, and even though they are still operated as a subsidy; any of working in the business world know a take over instantly results in cost cutting measures. This resulted in stalled support by the way of firmware updates to previous products.\n  In addition, the same time period this router released to the public, several news articles regarding the security vulnerability of Linksys routers came out; and sent consumers fleeing their products.\n  In my research I have found one listing specifically stating this router is vulnerable.\n*** things of note for security- 90% of the security flaws found in linksys routers were reported as vulnerable because  of two key factors.\n1. Owners failed to change the routers WiFi broadcast name.  this allows anyone to see what type of router you have based on this broadcast signal.\n2. it goes hand in hand with #1, owners failed to change the default administrator username and password. Makes sense, they do not change the broadcast name why bother with the username and password. This means anyone can access the https address by simply googling the router model found in the broadcast name to find IP address. With this they can access the login page. from the login page they can utilize the online support page showing the default name and password assigned to the product; basically because manufacturers use the same for their models.\n  From there they can reset the router, change passwords, and and even set up a DNS to filter all router communication.\n\nif you buy what should you do, and what to know-\n1. change default broadcast name to something unidentifiable to the product. And not your address, or apt number.\n2. activate HTTPS in the router settings.\n3. change the default username to something unique, and change the password as well to something with a combination of letters numbers, caps, and special characters.\n4. Turn off guest- WiFi access if no guests in the house - this can be controlled by the app.\n5. Wired connections are generally faster and more secure as you can turn off WiFi when not in use.\n6. since this is its own WiFi router this should already be the first line of defense, however, keep your ISP (Comcast, AT&t, Verizon, etc..) just a modem, not an all in one device as they issue hundreds of thousands of their devices and often same scenarios as above apply. this will be the next thing attackers try, especially if its Comcast because there router/modem broadcast a separate signal to the public to build WiFi Everywhere, and for their Cell phone service. If you have these services, ask for a modem only, or buy your own.",

                "review_body": "This works much better than the eero that my cable company provided me with. My old one would constantly drop signal, this Linksys provides a strong and steady signal. The signal seems to go a bit further if I angle the little antenna out to the side. The set-up was pretty easy as well. It can handle a lot of devices at a time, on busy days it's common to have my phone, my laptop, multiple tablet style devices, a tv, and security cameras all going at once and this router can handle them all. If it starts acting a little laggy I can switch a couple devices over to the 5GHz, I'm honestly not sure if that actually does anything to help but my brain pretends it does.",

                "review_body": "I have to say that I had high hopes for this product.  I have been an avid supporter of Linksys for the past decade.  I have used a multitude of their products with my customers, and in my house.  I purchased two of these routers to upgrade my access point and my father's.  That said, this product while having huge potential falls severely short to the point it is useless.  I will break this review into 2 parts.  1st the product and 2nd their customer service and technical support.\n\nTechnical issue:\nI have 4 different HP Elitebook laptops in the house.  Each of them randomly loses connection to the E8350 router and goes into Limited mode.  When this happens, you cannot ping the gateway or connect to the Linksys router itself.  To fix the problem, I have to disconnect from the channel I am on and join another wireless SSID.  I can then rejoin the previous channel and have full functionality.  The issue appears to happen more frequently on the 5 GHz channel.\n\nI have tried 3 different E8350 routers, all have the same issue.  Each laptop also has different model network cards in them.  The E8350 has 2 channels for broadcasting.  2.4 GHz and 5 GHz.  I have nothing else in my house broadcasting at 5 GHz. In order to rule out interference, I have the Linksys router's 2.4 GHz set for channel 11 as I also have Verizon FIOS Actiontec router that broadcasts on the 2.4 GHz band.  I have the Actiontec on channel 6.  I have tested every channel and bandwidth configuration option on the E8350 to rule out interference related matters, but the problem persists.\n\nI purchased this router to act as a high end access point for increased coverage and bandwidth.  I disabled all routing functionality on the router and hardwired the E8350 into the Verizon Actiontec router.  I have used this same configuration for many years and it worked flawlessly with my past few Linksys routers.\n\nOver the past 2 weeks I have tried multiple options and troubleshot every configuration known to Tier 1, Tier 2 and myself.  Linksys did a RMA and sent me 2 replacement routers to me and the problem is still occurring.\n\nI will be returning these routers and getting my money back.  They are 100% useless and unstable.\n\nCustomer Service/Tech Support:\nLinksysCares is completely useless. All they have done is complicate matters and fail to deliver.  Do not engage with them.  They do not communicate with Technical Support and when they do attempt to take over, they do not follow through.\n\nBelow is a recap of what I have endured to date.\n12/7 - spoke for 3 hours with your customer specialist (Gretchen) on the phone. She admitted to me that I did everything that she could think of to troubleshoot the part (I have an IT background and work for a major IT Company).\n\n12/9 Spoke to Emmy and troubleshot the part another 90 minutes and agreed to an 8 pm call the next day. Call never came. LinksysCares had handed the case over to T2 and they took the case from Emmy. The new person dropped the ball.  I called in to the main number again and waited 40-50 minutes to speak to a T2 person.  It ended up being Emmy again.\n\nWe ran multiple tests and proved that something is going on with the routers.  It was agreed to send out replacement routers next day air.  I was told it would be received by Thursday.  I advised support that if I couldn't get it next day I would return them via Amazon since they could do it next day without an issue.  I was assured it would be arriving on Thursday.  Morgan from the RMA department supposedly processed the order.\n\n12/11 I called Thursday because I never received the tracking information or RMA info. The part still had not been shipped.  Spoke to Gabriel who then processed the order or created it. He gave me the tracking numbers that were not active.  While this was going on LinksysCares finally responded to an email sent out a day previously providing tracking information for another person and a product delivered to another state.\n\n12/12 Due to the order shipping late, the item arrived while I was out of state. 3 days lost so far trying to resolve this and 7-9 hours wasted with support.\n\n12/14 Part was installed and the same issue is present. Email sent to LinksysCares asking for a 2:00 PM call to work on the issue on 12/15.  Never heard back.  Another day lost.\n\n12/15 wasted 2 hours trying to get to support.  Dialed in and got Teenu at T1.  He was completely incompetent.  I kept trying to get a supervisor and gave him my existing case information.  He kept asking me to explain the problem.  Apparently he couldn't read the past weeks' worth of notes.  He would not transfer me to T2 or his supervisor.  He actually hung up on me after asking me to call back.  At this point, I call the Executive Response number 714-768-6133 trying to escalate this.  Cindy told me that a T3 specialist will be calling me back in 24-48 hours (still waiting).\n\n12/16 - I call back the Executive Response team to find out that the case is with T2.  I speak to a manager (Samantha) who is escalating it to their corporate technicians.  Have to wait 24-48 hours for a call back...\n\nAs you can see, nobody communicates or takes ownership at Linksys.  They do not read case notes or care about the customer.",

                "review_body": "So I haven't purchased a router in years, as the Linksys router I had before lasted me a long time.\n\nI always loved Linksys the company because they had 24 tech support & their people high up in the company were nice & down to earth.\n\nI decided to finally get this new router & one of their high end tech support people helped me troubleshoot a problem I was having, plus helped me choose which model I needed.\n\nThat's when the problems started.\n\nI have issues with people who don't understand English & have no common sense. Nothing irks me more than having to repeat what I just said 5-10 minutes earlier, but alas, this is what we are forced to deal with when large corporations hire Indians & Filipinos from overseas for customer service or tech support.\n\nOnce I got the router, instead of waiting for the high end person to help me (she's also Filipino, but at the time seemed smarter), I decided to call up regular tech support.\n\nI ended up wasting an hour of my time & STILL didn't get my router up & running because I became irritated with their lack of simple common sense. I asked to speak to supervisors in hopes I would get someone smarter, but I was put on hold for ages, was hung up on & after calling back over & over again & finally realizing almost hour had lapsed, I finally gave up. I was exhausted.\n\nI even found out later on that the info from the router was never put into the computer even though I gave it to one of the people, so I had to do that ALL over again!\n\nI had to wait the entire weekend for the higher up person to come back on Monday to help me & by that time I was furious. There was a mixup with the time, so I finally said forget this, I want to speak to someone in the US & the one contact I had couldn't get me anyone.\n\nI was under a time constraint b/c I had to go out, so of course this escalated my stress.\n\nThen my appointment was canceled & they STILL couldn't get me anyone.\n\nI wasted ANOTHER 3-4 hours waiting & e-mailing back & forth with my contact who eventually stopped e-mailing me.\n\nFinally in the afternoon the higher end tech support girl I had dealt with before called me. That was a drama that took 1-2 hours & I finally figured out she also can't understand English some of the time & while her common sense was better than first level tech support, at times it wasn't there & I had to do her job for her. Needless to say, I was at my wits end.\n\nShe also refused to compensate me for all my time lost (a simple upgrade for tech support would have sufficed since they no longer give you one year, only 3 months), but all she did was apologize.\n\nOnce I was done with her, I then asked my contact for someone high up in the company. After I finally spoke to someone, she brushed me off & told me customer service would call me. When they called they were from tech support (HUH?). She thought I needed my router hooked up (yes people, even some people in the US are aren't all there.\n\nThe tech support person who was higher up also refused to give me anything for my trouble, so after this, I will NEVER EVER buy anything from Linksys again, & I will be letting everyone know they no longer have good customer or tech support. In my opinion, the company has just gone down the drain.\n\nWhether it's b/c Cisco bought them out, I have no clue, all I know is that I wasted 2 days of my time & they didn't even care to rectify the situation. The only person who truly seemed to care was the guy I was e-mailing with although like I mentioned, he too had suddenly stopped e-mailing me & he knew I was right here in real time waiting.\n\nThe one complaint I have about the hardware is that it's hard to put in & take out the ethernet cables. The way they have it designed, it's hard to slide them in b/c of that lip. They wanted to make the thing look cool, but instead it's not user friendly.",

                "review_body": "1. The CD did not  come of  much use. It was not connecting  to the  Extender. Period. Then I called them and got help from a GREAT technician  with Linksys\n2. The Concept\nYou obviously have a  wireless router.  This must sync with the Extender. Let's say you just plug in the extender. Windows Wireless refresh will pick up the  extender, but will do  nothing beyond  that. Since this is  not connected  to the  main router  yet,  it will not  even give you internet. Again the extender must be made to sync with the main router  in ALL respects.\n\n3. Simply connect the extender to the  lap  top computer using an  ethernet cable. Put the extender close by in a power outlet and  turn it  on i.e. until  the CSCO stops blinking and  stays  lit.\n4. From the  windows refresh wireless networks, choose the extender ( it always shows up)\n5. Try to open  an  internet browser.  IT will not  work,  since  the  extender does not connect to the internet.\n6. It will ask you for  user and pw. type  in admin in user id and  admin in pw\n7. this will open  the web interface for the  extender.\n8. Now  you have to  sync  with the  router.\n9. Go under wireless and click on  the main router SSID and  click Connect. This will ask you for the router password. Once you put that in  your are  done.\n10. Disconnect the ethernet cables.\n11. Again choose  the referesh wireless networks. Now you will not see the  extender. You will see the main router. However since the extender is synced with the  router, you can now move the extender somewhere midway between poor and  good reception.\n\nThe main  thing now. My  iphone started dropping the signals and  I had to reconnect each time  with the password. Since I knew  the CONCEPT, i went back  to the web interface of the  main router and  checked the  TYPE  of pass phrase.  It was WEP2 Personal. IT does not  matter which  one, but must the  same in the  extender. Just putting  the pw is not enough. It must be the same TYPE.\n\nSo in the  main router, I  verified the DHCP Reservation to check the RE1000 (extender. Check its IP  address.\n\nOpen a browser and type in this IP address  of the RE 1000\ntype in admin for  user id and admin for pw\n- Go to Basic Wireless Settings\n- Go to Manual\nIn Security Mode, choose the same TYPE of Security Mode as in the  main router.\nOf course put in the same Passphrase as in the main router.\n\nIf not  the extender will  drop your devices and you will  have to reenter the password.\n\nI have all the bars working now in our 5000 sq ft house and even gets WIfi on the deck with 2 bars and 1 bar even when I go to the  Stop sign and  the end  of the road.\n\nFYI  : Disclaimer : I am just a computer lay person. I  wrote this  to help people  like me.  Maybe if you have  better computers it will  work like they say i.e. just plug in  and  it  will work. The problem, we  make so many changes to  our  wireless routers  over the years etc that you will have to  do  some work.\n\nGood  Luck.",

                "review_body": "I'll start by saying I already have a decent main router, an Asus RT-AC68U (AC 1900) running AdvancedTomato firmware, that covers my whole house pretty well.  I bought this extender because upon the initial installation of my Ring video doorbell, the doorbell dropped its link a few times.  This extender was available dirt cheap in Used - Like New condition, and someone had given me an Amazon gift card.  YOLO.  However, as soon as I made my purchase, of course the Ring doorbell's connectivity issues vanished.  So I bought this extender to solve a problem that already solved itself, it seems.  I guess the doorbell was self-updating its firmware and rebooting without warning, giving the illusion of dropped connections.\n\nBe that as it may, when I received my new toy, I went ahead and plugged it in and ran through the setup wizard.  Setup was a bit tricky, and I had to work around a few bugs.  This is on the November 2017 firmware, the latest update available from Linksys as of this review.\n\nFirstly, I must warn you that regardless of your proficiency, even if you are an IT tech by trade, you MUST perform the initial setup via the wizard and ignore the manual setup link on the OOBE welcome page.  Clicking the manual setup link results in a password prompt you can't dismiss or circumvent until you use the reset button on the extender.  (I don't think I tried \"admin\" as the password, though, which is a common default for Linksys routers.)\n\nAlso, for my setup, the extender failed to route traffic to any client whose IP was defined in a DHCP reservation on the main router.  It's odd.  Even if I configured a DHCP reservation on the same IP block as undefined guests, the only host the client could see was the extender itself -- not the main router (including its DNS service), nor anything outside the LAN.  The moment I deleted the IP reservation and released and renewed the IP on the client though, the connection was perfect.  I tested this phenomenon on an Android phone, a Win 10 desktop, two Win 10 laptops, and an Echo Dot.  I think this is a bug in the extender's latest firmware.  But I will concede that my main router's routing tables and firewall rules are uncommonly complicated.\n\nAll that aside, I'm glad I got this extender.  The night after I started playing with it, my daughter complained that her Echo Dot had been giving her trouble for some time.  The symptoms she described hinted at weak signal, and indeed my router reported the link quality in the red at 10 - 12%.  I plugged the extender in between the router and her bedroom, deleted her Dot's IP reservation and lease, then paired the Dot with the extender.  She can now listen to music stutter-free, and her commands receive a much faster response.\n\nFor you who prefer objective data, the extender's \"Spot finder\" page shows the extender currently right on the transition between \"Too close\" and \"Just right\".  The 2.4 GHz band has a link speed of 130 Mbps.  The 5 GHz band, 600 Mbps.",

I was looking to see if the manual had any special instructions regarding the adjustable antennas.  The CD was useless, I tried several ways to review and it was set up to open with Adobe reader.  The router when I first positioned it approx thirty feet in an adjacent room through the wall performed flawlessly.  The software would permit the activity lights to be turned off, but the Linksys illuminated bright light on top of the unit stayed on.  I back feed the unit since I have installed more than one RJ45 in the room back to my server room permitted me to back feed.  I had a visitor who really needed her sleep and the white light was an issue I decided to relocate the unit in another room approx sixty feet from the same location I originally tested the speeds, and the speeds fell off, and it kept dropping connections, my quest said when she was in quest mode kept dropping her signal too.  I was really disappointed when I unable to install in my own office now I move it back to the quest room where I got the best signal.  I set up my older router a Linksys WRT54GS, as an access point in another building which is wired through a secondary Ethernet panel, and in the same location as my older Linksys WRT54G was located I could not even connect to the new Max Stream where as I had no problem connecting to my old unit WRT54GS when located in the guest room.  I might not have the three MU-MIMO antennas positioned correctly but unable to read the manual on the CD I am still searching to find a configuration to help make the signal better......when I had it in the first room...... I got excited since the older router wouldn't permit the speeds I finally saw on various servers using speedtest.net over 60 mbps.  I might post another post if I find a configuration with the antennas.  I have a large home and was really looking after I read many posts this unit would do what I needed it to do.  Even with the unit in the center of the house I was unable to get a signal in the back of the house, a bit over eighty feet or more.  I am thinking about rewiring several runs to feed ceiling type access points to improve the signal, once I saw the speed I was hooked.  I am not a novice, but also not an IT or a certified Microsoft technician, you don't need to have any skills to set this router up... you can do it manually and or just let it do its things... If it had the range it would receive the last star...",

                "review_body": "This router delivers a very strong 5G signal across 3 floors of our apartment from a bedroom in the upper corner.  it delivers the same 350Mbps that we get out of our cable modem with a wired connection pretty much anywhere except standing right next to the fridge, where it gets 295Mbps.  I haven't even tried the 2.4Ghz signal yet since the 5Ghz works for our entire space.  This thing is a godsend because I no longer need to consider a mesh network (the Linksys Velop, fastest of the meshes right now (spring 2017), doesn't have anywhere near the throughput of this thing, and you have to put the little towers everywhere).  Putting APs in the ceiling is very invasive and ugly as well.  I was hoping that I could buy the most powerful wifi router on the market and see if it would work for our space, and I'm glad I did.  Nothing in the apartment is more than about 30 feet away at most, so we never have to leave 5G for our iPhones and Macs (My Late 2016 Mac Pro with the 3x3 chip in it works great with this router; no slowdown anywhere in the apartment).  I haven't even done anything yet with the antennas other than arrange them as shown in the marketing material - straight up.\n\nIt also has lots of ports on the back, so the stuff I'm going to hardwire to it: Wink hub, Lutron hub, etc, will all be connected and still leave room for other things in the future.\n\nyes, it's VERY expensive for a wifi router.  But, for me, the fact that I don't need to run ethernet cable everywhere makes it worth it.  My previous routers, a Technicolor that came with TWC/Spectrum subscription, and then a Routerboard hAP AC (awesome configurability and features in RouterOS!) didn't have the legs to put 5G everywhere like I wanted at the speeds this Linksys does.\n\nThe only complaint I have is that the router wants you to sign up for Linksys Smart Wi-Fi, so that you can control your router while you're away, but when it asks you to register and then sign into the site, it's unencrypted.  It seems to want you to put your username and password in on an unencrypted login over the internet!  what!?  no thanks!  Of course, you don't have to do that, but the setup process really pushes you to sign up, and doesn't really tell you what to do if you don't want to log in with your password unencrypted.  Minus one star for that, as a less technical customer would easily be fooled and blithely log in unencrypted.  It makes me wonder about the security of the device too, so I'll go in and mess with the firewall.  By the way, if you want to skip the scary \"sharing your password with attackers\" stuff, just go through the setup, but stop when it wants you to access anything other than 192.168.1.1 unencrypted.  When it asks you to do that, just go to 192.168.1.1 again and log in to the router directly.  All of the settings are on the router itself -- I guess you can't use the iPhone app to control it, but if you have to do it by sending your password in clear text?  not worth it.  Plus, why should i share how my network is configured, who is on it, etc with any company?\n\nAnyhow, over all, highly recommended, just skip the smart wi-fi site stuff and you'll be fine.",

                "review_body": "Update 07/19/2018:\nWhile this router did get a little better over time (after a couple of firmware updates), and has served me \"okay\" for the past 3 years, I've decided to upgrade to a Mesh WiFi system, hoping it will provide better coverage, and more reliable connectivity ...\n\nI often have to reset devices that show a strong WiFi signal, but can't get to the internet. I\"m not a 100% sure the problem is with the router alone, but based on my experience with this router over the years, I believe it is. Also, this still has trouble when connecting devices further away. Even though it will show good signal strength, and those devices can easily connect to the WiFi, they can become unusable at times.\nThat said, when you are within it's usable range, to does perform well. I have 100/10 Mbps Spectrum internet service and see download speeds right around 100 Mbps (+/- 10 Mbps), with over 30 connected devices.  I'll also add, given the number of devices I have on my network, some of my issues over the years, might have been the result of a device acting up (virus or hardware issue, etc...).\n\nIMO, if you have a smaller home (under 2000 sq ft.) or an apartment with relatively modern construction (no chicken wire in the walls, etc..), and can locate the router at a central location in your home, it will serve you well, and provide decent coverage and high proformance throughout the interior of your home, but don't expect reliable coverage out to your pool, or driveway etc.... Also, don't expect to place it in a far corner of your home and have reliable coverage in the opposite far corner.\n\nOriginal Review:\nI purchased this router because my previous router (Netgear N600, as good as it is) was struggling to keep up with all of our devices at times. We are a household of 5 heavy internet users (online gaming, streaming video, VOIP, teleworking, surfing etc...).  It's not uncommon to have 20+ devices connected to my network simultaneously. So when I saw this as a \"Deal of the Day\" I though it could resolve our network congestion issues, and it has, but...\n\nConsidering this is the flagship offering from Linsys (at the time of this review), and retails for $300, It's disappointing, and here is why...\n\nI've experienced some of the drop issues other users have reported. With the router installed at one side of my 2800 sq ft. single story home, I could receive 75%-100% WiFi signal on my iPhone 5S at the opposite side of my home. Yet in key locations (my bed for example), the signal would drop from 100% to 75%, then 50%, then 25%, then switch to LTE, then back to WiFi at 100% etc... All this was happening at a fixed location (no movement). My Netgear N600 also struggled to connect at that distance, but never presented an illusion of full signal strength. The fact that the signal strength constantly fluctuates so drastically at fixed location (nearing it's distance limit) obviously presents a problem.\n\nI was able to eliminate this issue by relocating the router to a central location in my home (same location I had my Netgear router) using a powerline adapter, and I now have a good usable signal in every corner of my home.\n\nAnother area it falls short is bridge mode. This mode (also known as AP or Access Point mode in other brands) eliminates almost every feature. In bridge mode you loose the ability to administer the router from a mobile device, you loose parental controls, QOS, the use of the USB ports, and many other features. I used my Netgear N600 in AP mode and didn't loose any features other than routing. This is disappointing to say the least.\n\nI'm still experimenting to find the best configuration for my network environment (bridge mode vs routing mode; single SSID vs different SSID's for each radio etc...), but the performance and coverage has improved over my previous router at the same installation location.  Although I was hoping to relocate the router next to my modem and eliminate the powerline adapters, but this was not feasible.\n\nAt the price I paid, I'll make it work because there are noticeable performance gains over my previous router, but at full retail, I'd choose another brand. Linksys seems to be falling behind the rest of the pack.",

                "review_body": "I ordered this router through Amazon, along with its sister PCMCIA card for my Gateway Solo laptop.  My goal was merely to broadcast the Comcast Digital Cable access throughout my 2,000 square feet home at the faster 802.11g speed.  I wanted to surf the Web from the comfy couch in the TV room or a cozy chair in the living room...my choice -- no wires involved.  I have never installed a network, so a lot of the literature, reviews on Amazon, and other sources of information were lost on me:  I simply went with the big name brand at a reasonable price.\nI installed the router in about 20 minutes using the accompanying CD.  Lights were flashing, and the hard connection to my laptop recognized the router.  Flipped up the 5 inch rabbit ears and seemed to be in business. All-in-all pretty seamless.  I had high hopes that I'd be wirelessly surfing soon. This was pretty exciting to me, as I am still running on Windows 98SE, and worried that I might encounter difficulties.\nThe installation of the sister WPC54G PCMCIA card didn't go so well.  Again, I ran it instruction-by-instruction from the installation CD, and while the Linksys software seemed to install OK, the procedure tripped up when attempting to install a program called 'Odyssey' from a firm called Funk Software, Inc.  The program kept looking for drivers, requesting that I insert the Microsoft Windows 98SE disk in my drive.  I don't have a Microsoft disk, but a Gateway OEM version that apparently has Microsoft Windows 98SE, but not the specific drivers that Odyssey needs.  To sum up, I spent several hours, all told, surfing Microsoft, Linksys, and Funk Software knowledgebase pages, downloading stuff, booting and rebooting my laptop, before giving up and going to bed frustrated.  Tried again in the morning, and somehow, I still don't know how, hit the right combination of set up protocols that suddenly energized the PCMCIA card.  I went from zero to eighty in no time, and my profanities turned to whoops of joy.\nThe best online help came from Funk Software, where I found a customer service technician at the help desk who answered my emails.  His solution: as I was running a simple home office network (not a corporate enterprise solution) and I didn't employ a RADIUS server (whatever that is?) I shouldn't need Odyssey, so gave me good instructions on how to eradicate it from my PC.  Still not entirely sure what Odyssey purports to do, so perhaps I'm missing some benefit?\nNonetheless, the router and card in my laptop are communicating nicely throughout the house...no connections further than 3 walls and 150 feet.  Speed is excellent.  I stepped through the setup of what I suppose is a rudimentary firewall (clicked a box marked 'Firewall enabled') and turned on WEP 128.  I hope to figure out WPA next, and I hope that Odyssey is not part of this set up, but in the final analysis I am pleased with the product, happy I didn't have to pay a consultant, and sending this report to Amazon wirelessly from my comfy chair!\nExperience of user:  None.\nTotal install time:  5 hours\nBiggest problem: Firmware for WPC54G card missing drivers",

                "review_body": "I'll preface this review with a notice that I do have an open support ticket with Linksys Support: Case ID 2909252_Wrt1900ac\nI do have issues with this router. Not everyone will. Not everyone wants or needs to use this router to its full potential. I do. I paid a premium price to use this router to its full potential, and it doesn't work trouble-free.\n\nOnce my router is fixed and working correctly, I will come back and update this review. Until then...\n\nFor a router that bills itself as \"Performance Perfected\" and \"Engineered for Intuitive Use and Ultimate Performance\", it has sadly fallen short of these claims that are printed right on the box it comes in. It seems like it has been rushed to market without being adequately tested. Shame on Belkin for besmirching the Linksys brand. With an ever-growing wireless router market, with other brands bringing similar hardware into the marketplace, jumping the gun and releasing such a buggy product is a good way to drive customers to these other brands.\n\nIf you consider yourself to be more advanced than the average computer user and are spending premium $$ on this router to use it in all its glory, you'll be wasting your money. You will essentially be paying to be a beta tester. If you are a 'set it and forget' type of user that won't be using the admin GUI to constantly make changes as you grow your network or use the admin GUI to monitor the network map and router logs, and you don't mind spending premium dollars on a product that you won't be using to its full potential, then you will probably be happy with this router. Though, if that were the case, you could save some money and get a less expensive sub-$200 router that only has the features you really need.\n\nThe stock firmware (including the most recent firmware update from July 10th) is buggy, and if you check the Linksys Community Forum for Wireless Routers (http://community.linksys.com/t5/Wireless-Routers/bd-p/Wireless_Routers) you will see some of these issues. Issues including a random disconnect/reboot problem if you spend too much time using the router admin GUI, it randomly factory resets itself if you turn it off and back on using the power switch on the back of the router, and wireless connection issues with older wireless devices like the Xbox Slim, just to name a couple of issues. Here is my video of the disconnect/reboot issue: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf0YHXq4fk8  The video is long, but there are clickable timestamps in the description that will take you to the parts of interest. Essentially, the more time you spend in the router admin GUI, the more likely you are to experience a random reboot. Obviously, once the router reboots itself, all devices are disconnected and can't access each other or the Internet until the reboot is complete, which takes just over one minute. And in my case I have an additional issue with a Linksys SD2008 gigabit switch that is connected to the WRT1900AC router. Approximately 15%-25% of the time, the Linksys SD2008 switch won't relink with the router when it reboots and I have to go and power-cycle the SD2008 switch to get it to link up with the WRT1900AC. There is also an issue with the SPI Firewall in the router that blocks the DHCP renewal of the WAN connection with some external modems or gateways. My Internet connection drops briefly every 10 minutes as a result of this SPI Firewall issue. The only solution is to turn off the SPI Firewall and leave my LAN less secure, just to get continuous uninterrupted Internet!\n\n<EDIT> Just to add to this SD2008 switch issue, I also have a Netgear 100Mb 5-port switch and a Netgear Gigabit 8-port switch connected directly to the WRT1900AC and they don't have any issues re-establishing a link when the router reboots. I just don't know if it's a problem with the SD2008 or if there is some timing issue with the WRT1900AC switch port reset that happens after the power-on diagnostic completes. I still have to do more tests.</EDIT>\n\nOther than these nagging issues, I like the way the router looks and I like the admin GUI. I like that the WAN and LAN ports are all gigabit speed. I like that it has eSATA and USB ports that I can use to share printers and storage. If I stay out of the admin GUI, I have no problems streaming IP network cameras to the Internet 24/7, no problems streaming videos from the Internet to my Roku or PCs (Hulu, Netflix, YouTube, etc), no problems streaming music or videos from my server to media players on my LAN, no problems with connecting IP network cameras, laptops, smartphones, and a printers via 2.4GHz wireless-G and wireless-N (I'm currently only using 2.4GHz, and haven't tested the 5GHz). All-in-all, the hardware seems firm, but the firmware is still a bit shaky.\n\nIn summary, if you want a router that you can use to its full potential without nagging problems, either look for a different router and do thorough research on it before buying or hold off on purchasing this one until it gets fixed. If you don't think you will use the admin GUI once you get through the initial configuration and setup, if you don't think you will be turning it off and on regularly, and if you don't mind paying a premium price knowing these issues are lurking just beneath the surface, then take a chance and get it.\n\nEDIT 9/22/14\nNearly three months since contacting Linksys Support and still no firmware update that fixes the reboot issue or the SPI Firewall issue that blocks DHCP renewal of my WAN connection to my AT&T Uverse Gateway!\n\nEDIT 10/18/14\nNow more than three months since contacting Linksys Support and more than three months since the last firmware update, there is still no new firmware or solutions to fix the reboot issue or the SPI Firewall issue that blocks the DHCP renewal of my WAN connection to my AT&T Uverse Gateway! HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE!!!!\n\nEDIT 12/6/2014\nLinksys finally got around to releasing a new firmware update after almost 5 months. I am immensely disappointed to find that, after updating to the new firmware, I still have the exact same problems with the WRT1900AC. Random reboots while using the admin interface that knock my whole LAN offline while the router reboots. The SPI Firewall still blocks the DHCP renewal of the WAN IP address with my AT&T Uverse Internet service.\n\nEDIT 3/19/2015\nMany months later, two ignored support tickets (Case IDs 02909252 and 03811269), and I still have a router that spontaneously reboots while using the admin interface. And there are still no good options for open source firmware due to Belkin/Linksys not releasing open source wireless drivers. Belkin is one of the absolute worst tech companies. It's where good brands go to die. RIP Linksys :(",

                "review_body": "I bought a refurbished version of this router and the only signs of it were the packaging (no clear plastic on anything, cables were tied to themselves and no instruction manual- not that I needed one) and the labels on the bottom which have the corners slightly frayed. Other then that, everything looks and feel good. The router has been functioning perfectly since I've gotten it. It's a basic router with a 4 port gigabit switch (which operates at full speed) and just USB 3.0, not USB3.1. so it only supports 5Gbs not 10Gbs (you will never get those speeds obviously in the real world, but it means it is still twice as slow as USB 3.1). Regardless it doesn't matter to me because I have a NAS server and don't use the USB port. It has average speeds for the price as it uses an older, lower end revision of the 802.11ac standard limiting you to 300Mbits on the 2.4Ghz band and 867Mbits on the 5Ghz band. For average household use (let's say, two adults and 2.5 kids) this is, realistically, more than enough for everyone to do their thing at the same time. Sadly it means I cannot download files over WiFi at gigabit speeds, but I did only pay $50 for it, so I cannot complain. Internally it has all the standard features as every other Linksys router since the early 2000s updated to match today's security standards + \"Smart WiFi\" which is supposedly a cloud based remote control of your router? But you could always do that by opening a port and enabling access from a non local IP on older Linksys routers so this is really a Cisco gimmick which I do not use. Security wise it offers all the common modern day access security protocols as well as a basic firewall, port forwarding, and MAC filtering. It has a WPS button on it, but I disabled that since I don't want people touching my networking equipment. It also has the ability to create a guest network, pretty standard these days, but handy none the less. One very nice and slightly less than standard feature that is has though is QoS (or as they call it \"Media Prioritization\") which lets you set bandwidth priority to devices and even specific applications which are connected. It also has built in support for DDNS, which is nice, I suppose. Somewhere in there, there is also parental controls, however since I never used them I have nothing to say about them or how they work. It is kind of a shame that these are all the feature it supports as hardware wise this little baby could support much more, but Cisco had a nasty habit of crippling their \"Home\" products to force you to buy their \"Business\" line. This makes it all the more saddening that this router does not support DD-WRT at the moment. Last thing to note is that this router does support IPv6 (though if you are running a VPN at home you *NEED* and I can't stress that enough, turn it off.)\n\nTL;DR Great basic router for every day use in a moderate sized household (Keep in mind people that 5GHz has a much more limited range than 2.4Ghz and would be the only reason you would spring extra cash to buy AC over N) with more than enough bandwidth to satisfy the average user. It also has an easy, self explanatory interface that let's you set up your secure network quickly without confusing you with all the other stuff that it can do, and it can do everything a normal household can. Best AC router for the price.",

                "review_body": "I really, really, reeeeallllyy want to love this router. I have two of the WRT54G's and have NEVER had an issue with them since loading WRT firmware. Rock solid. I use one as a bridge to my garage, another for a printer that I needed to be on the network. Before this router I had a Buffalo router that was also very solid, came stock with WRT firmware installed with some OEM skinning that I didn't mind. When the WRT AC1900 was announced and I seen it for the first time I was drooling, I wanted that thing so bad. I still had the buffalo router though and it was only a year old, no way I was gonna convince my wife to let me get another router for upwards of 200$. I knew my time would come and waited for the price to go down on this one, well after having my Buffalo run my nas server 24/7 in the Hawaiian heat it just started to fail on me. Despite no changes in configs or anything else on the network it would randomly drop all the devices on my network and the only fix was to factory reset, and redo my many, many configs. Even if I loaded a known good image it wouldn't work so i had to start from scratch every time. Wife said lets get a new one, I immediately went to this ones page. I was sad to see all the negative reviews and was seriously hoping it was just a bad batch or something. Despite all the reviews, I wanted this and I went with this model.\nSetup was a cinch, although I do not like the user interface, for a \"WRT\" router it is too simple, as other people have mentioned I also do not prefer to create an account to have to sign into my router. Now when I go back to look for the option to skip logging in without username and password that option is not there, so I'm not sure if it's removed once you've set up the router, but I can't get into my router locally without going through that interface. Which brings me to my issues with this router.\n1: Set it up, tested speeds, it was running gorgeously. TWO DAYS, two days into it man, lost all my speed on my 300+ network. I was down to sub 1mb speeds. I tested from the arris modem and was hitting 345 down easy. Had to factory reset the router for the first time and redo all of my configs hoping it was just a fluke. It hasn't dropped my speeds again as of yet fingers crossed.\n2: A few days later I noticed two of my servers weren't accessible remotely.  I logged into my remote software and checked the connections on the servers which were obviously up since I was able to log into them, I checked the ports to make sure they were still open for these services and yes the ports were open, but the IP addresses I originally had when I set up my router were now from a private IP address pool. Instead of 192.168. etc I was on a 10. ip address scheme. I figured ok, maybe something was going on with my TWC service and it re-issued new addresses, that's fine with me I just had to change all of my configs for the new addresses.. About a week later I was doing maintenance on one of the servers and noticed that the IP's were back to 192 again, had to go back into the router and switch all the configs back to these IP's. Fearing having to do this numerous times I reset the modem and the router. No issues related to this since then.\n3: Twice now I've been unable to log into the my router, either wirelessly, or directly connected. This isn't a password issue, this is a pain in the #$$ issue. I log into the address 192.168.1.1, which redirects me to the login page for linksyssmartwifi, I input my information, it loads, I can see log out in the top right hand corner, the wheel spins, and then tells me it can't connect to the router, check to make sure my router is on the network. I'm done at this point. It's like having a brand new Ferrari in your yard that is spotless, but only runs some of the time.\n I have requested a replacement from amazon, I will put that one through it's paces and if even a hint of the same issues come with that router I will very sadly go to the Asus or nighthawk AC routers.",

                "review_body": "Linksys EA7500 Max-Stream\u2122 AC1900 MU-MIMO Gigabit Router (with WUSB6100 WIFI Adapter)\n\nThis thing is rock solid!!. My previous router setup was a Linksys E3000, coupled with the WUSB6300 USB WIFI adapter, which replaced an AE1000 that died.\nSetup was painless. I didn\u2019t need to download any software from the website. Drivers installed seamlessly, on a Windows 10 pro box. Before upgrading I highly recommend taking snapshots of your existing router confg pages. Trust me, this makes life a lot easier down the road. The smart Wifi app makes things even easier by looking for the most recent firmware, and updating the router. Whaaaat?? Yes!! No more going to web site, selecting router, version number, and checking the firmware. Hey you,  click this button for firmware upgrade, Boom! It was so weird I had to do it twice just make sure I was seeing what I was seeing. I instantly changed the name of the network and password, because, well I\u2019m old school. You had to, lol.\n\nAs I started this review, It just works. My devices are a dvr with 4 security cameras around the perimeter of the house which are always on, Xbox360, 3 cell phones on wifi, 4 tablets, 1 desktop, 1 Synology ds215j NAS, 2 laptops, etc.. Thanks to MU-MIMO. Feed the devices, feed them all, ha ha ha ha {evil laugh}.\nMy test this morning was to download some files via a torrent client, and play MW3 on Xbox live to see if there would be any lag. Things were downloading so fast I could barely perform the test. But I did find a file 1.5gb that wasn\u2019t seeding as well, and was able to play MW3, stream Pandora from my cell phone, and there was no noticeable lag. Me likey. Me likey a lot! It just works, and works very well. As most of you reading this will attest to, in your household you are the I.T. / Network Engineer / computer guy, and things just have to work.  No one cares how it works, it just needs to work. When my 5yr old daughter (Puddin' 2) is watching her Michael Jackson videos on Youtube, and it stops, she\u2019s getting up from the workstation and seeking out Daddy. If she can\u2019t get to her Nickjr., oh my!! No Paw Patrol, or Miles, or Jeesh, Peppa Pig, those tiny feet are walking with a purpose to tell me what happened. And yes, she is the boss of me, lol. I drop what I\u2019m doing and hop right to it. She pays me in hugs and kisses, and that makes everything else bearable. My fianc\u00e9 (Puddin' 1) gets the same treatment. I never have to tell her I think the oven isn\u2019t working cause I\u2019m hungry. Lol.. Although, that probably wouldn\u2019t be a bright idea. She handles the cooking, the baby handles the hugging, and dad handles the network. Linksys has made my job much easier than should be allowable in the household. Almost seems unfair, almost. Lol. This setup is unbelievably fast, and reliable. My next test is to see if I can keep a strong signal while outback of the house. The E3000 signal was very weak. That sucked for cookouts. Now I believe we will be rocking, while streaming music from the Nas, as well as Pandora. Lastly, people often say the proof is in the puddin. Well, the Puddin's are happy. Thus Dad's ecstatic.\n\nThanks Linksys.\n\nCheck the speedtest screenshots below:\n1) E3000 with WUSB6300. 2.4ghz\n\n2) E3000 with WUSB6300 5ghz\n\n3) EA7500 with WUSB6100 AC MU-MIMO  adapter 5ghz, and 2.4ghz were relatively the same.\n\n4) Galaxy S4 Speed tests. The top one is at work over a T1, or T3 line, the rest are the home network. Pretty Impressive. Pretty impressive indeed.\n\n5) The remaining 3 are from my Galaxy S4 wifi analyzer app.",

                "review_body": "I did so much research prior to buying this router. I'm still not sure I found the right one or made the right purchase. But for the deal I got on this, I can't complain when you match it up against other products that are similar in function and specs. In the end, this was the best Bang for Your Buck on the market at the time with the Amazon price I got (I paid $150).\n\nBut for all sense and purposes, I should have spent more money and went to the next level... \"The $200 Tier\" as I will call it. It seems the price levels are exactly that...every $100 you spend gets you one more level up (with a few exceptions here and there). And each tier is a little better than the one below it. Our house isn't HUGE but it is a big house. 4 bedrooms, 2 baths, 2 levels and an unfinished basement. In all, right around 2600 sq ft so an average size home in America's standard. Hard to believe but true. I consider it too big. Regardless, I have this router in the western corner of the basement where I have a home office set up. It will reach out fairly well to the next level up throughout the house. But when you get to the top level of the house, the WiFi signal does drop off to 3 to 4 bars out of 5, and I have experienced some issues with downloads and such from my phone and labtop.\n\nI don't know a lot about routers or computers but I'm not completely numb to it all. I know how to educate myself and I've done so enough to manipulate the settings and such with my desktop in the basement to get the best function capacity I can out of this router. I'm satisfied in the end with this purchase because I got it at an affordable price and I know this Linksys model (AC 1900) is at the top of it's class...at least top 5 or 6 depending on the reviewer. I even called my Uncle over who has spent nearly 25 years in the computer industry, specializing as a programmer for about 20 of those years. He tweaked the system a bit as well and guaranteed I'm getting the best performance out of it possible.\n\nThis router is very user friendly as well. The setup was about as painless as you can endure and the functions of it are straight forward and a breeze to navigate. Without going in to great detail, you can do a lot of specializing and customization with this router. The Dual Band spec is an important one and gives you the ability to pick and choose what devices work off of which channel. So, you can choose a Priority over another and so on. I have 5 different devices that run off this router but never at the same time. At most I have 2 devices running off this router at the same time but the ability to run up to 10 is definitely there.\n\nIn the end, I would recommend this router for a price of $150 or less if you can find it. And for any homes larger than 2500 sq ft I would have to say you might want to look in to the next level up in routers. I hate to say it but that's my experience. And I could do some things different that could increase the signal like moving the location but I have my reasons for not doing that. But again, I would probably spend another $50 and get that extra juice for a larger home. This is a 4-5 star router no matter what.",

                "review_body": "Before buying this product I read a lot of your reviews - many of which warned potential buyers that NO WAY does this product work with Mac computers, is a bad product anyway, has no customer support, etc.. I found that all of this was just not true - for the most part. It is true that it is obviously not meant for Macs, not really. It works with Macs in that there is nothing preventing a Mac from working with it, but all the customer support and the CD that comes with the product (which has no Mac OS version) is pretty clearly NOT for Mac. That said, my Linksys Wireless-G is up and running just fine with my Mac. The guys who installed my high speed internet recommended this model, which they have recommended to all their customers. I have used it many times in the little town near here which has a downtown Wi-Fi project, and so I knew that there shouldn't be a problem.\n\nMy Mac picked up the wireless signal immediately, but getting my modem to communicate with this signal was another matter. Because the CD is for PCs only, I could not use it so I called my techie brother to come here with his PC laptop to configure it. I'd say that'd probably be the easiest solution for anyone with a Mac who wants to use it. Configure it through a PC, then make sure you can connect as well.\n\nI was a little amused after reading electronics guy's review, where he says: \"The fact is that configuring networking and especially secure wireless networking requires that the user know at least a little bit about what they are doing.\" My brother has been working with computers since the days when they were TRS-80s and he was 13 years old. He knows hardware, software, systems better than most people and it took him more than an hour to get my Mac to work with this. Of course he poo-poo'd the CD, along with the instructions the support guy sent (yes, you can get very good support without spending two hours on the phone to India - just EMAIL the request, I got a response in less than 24 hours, with follow-up a couple of days later). Anyway, so, he didn't use either of these resources, avoiding them in the way men usually avoid asking for driving directions.... He got his PC to function with this router fairly quickly. My Mac required some 'jiggling.' Eventually he had to take off the security because when it was on, I could not connect. Also, we had a difficult time getting the router to surrender the 'Linksys' name. But we did manage that finally.\n\nBottom line about all of this - It sure does work with Macs, and works fine. But, it is easier to configure it through a PC, and maybe that is what God, and Linksys, intended. There might be some residual problems, such as lack of ability to protect your network - but hell, I like my neighbors, let 'em hack in if they can. Finally - you will get good support and quickly if you send your request via email. Everyone knows telephone support - for anything, sucks. Your support might not be relevant for a Mac, but, again, this product wasn't intended for them though it does work just fine with them if you can get past the configuration hurdles.",

                "review_body": "Update on August 27th, 2016\n\nI don't seem to have the issue mentioned in the below review anymore so it looks like the firmware issue is now fixed.  Also the app seems to be more functional after an app update. As a result I am increasing the rating from 3 stars to 4 stars.  Much better over the past month than my first month with the unit since the app and the firmware were updated.\n\n=========================================\nOriginal review:\nThe wireless on this device is rock solid - better than any router than I have owned.  Very fast wireless and very rock solid wireless.\nHowever, there is an issue with the firmware which is annoying.  Specifically the wired DHCP IP address that the router fetches is not \"lease renewed\" once the lease actually does expire.  What does that mean?  Well, it means that the router cannot connect to the internet after about a week or so (in my case) although the time until the router cannot connect to the internet varies based on internet service provider.  The good news is that this seems like an easy fix for Linksys.  The bad news is that until Linksys does fix this problem that the short term  \"fix\" to the problem is to hit the rocker switch on the back of the device to reset the device and that leads to further annoyances such as:\n  1) The rocker switch is very hard to control because my fingers are too big to get the finger between the left most antenna and power cable (they should have put the rocker switch somewhere where fingers can access them.\n  2) The app for this device is great EXCEPT when the router loses connectivity to the internet like this then the only way the app can access the router is wirelelessly (which makes sense).  BUT the menu options on the app are different when accessing the router wirelessly such that the menu option for renewing the DHCP address or rebooting the router ARE NOT THERE which leads me back to #1 above which is toggling a difficult to get at rocker switch.  Of course after you reboot the router manually and then restore the DHCP address of the router THEN the app will allow you to renew the DHCP address and reboot the router from the app.  But by then it is too late :).\n  3) Oddly (and I am not sure why this is) the rocker switch for rebooting the router works 100% of the time that I have had this problem whereas pulling the power cable and then plugging back in the power cable on the router does not seem to fix the problem.  That fact has me a bit baffled - maybe what is going on is that the router has good capacitors in it which retain the charge well enough where the router won't renew the IP address unless power is disconnected for a very long time.  That is the only reason that I could see why the rocker switch would work but the pulling of the power cable would not work.\n\nIn any event I hope Linksys fixes the firmware of the device so that this \"once per week\" issue can be resolved.  Further I hope that Linksys fixes the iPhone app so that the user can reboot the device AND renew the IP address of the device when the router loses its DHCP lease to the internet and the user has to access the router directly wirelessly rather than thru the internet (because the DHCP IP address is lost).\n\nIf Linksys fixes this issue I would raise the rating of the product.",

                "review_body": "I will try to post my review on this router by using numbers whenever possible, because most users would probably get more succinct info out of actual numbers than a descriptive account of the device. I received this router free of charge from Linksys agreeing to post an honest feedback in return. This feedback and all the test results I have cited here are real and noted from actual tests I performed myself.\n\nSpeed:\n\nI have decent high speed internet (130-160 Mbps DL on Ethernet directly attached to my cable modem), and I had been using Netgear R6300 prior to this, and was generally happy with it.\nI live in a single family, 2-storey house, and speeds that I consistently got with the R6300 was about 90-100 Mbps when in \"line of sight\" with the router. 60-70 Mbps when in the corners of the house like laundry room etc.\nWith the LinkSys EA7500, I am now getting 115-130 Mbps when in \"line of sight\" with the router. 85-100 Mbps when in the corners.\n\nThat's on average about 35% better performance than the R6300. So yes, this router will blast an average sized house with WiFi connectivity.\n\nConcurrent connectivity/Stress test:\n\nMost of the time, my router will be concurrently supporting 20-30 devices. On the EA7500 I have noticed up to 25 devices, including IP Cams, VoIPs, Media devices, TVs, phones, tablets, watches, computers, game consoles and printers.\nI have a 2TB external HDD with all my videos, pictures and music on it attached directly to the EA7500. Thus I have a DLNA server on my network which won't be using up my PC resources. (I used to run Plex on my desktop for this purpose).\nI have had 6 devices play high definition video simultaneously, from different sources like Amazon, Netflix, Youtube and DLNA content without any glitches or hiccups whatsoever.\nSo not only do you get a faster connection, it does seem that the EA7500 does an excellent job when serving up multiple devices consuming large amounts of data concurrently as well.\n\nDLNA/File-sharing/ftp server:\n\nYou can set up your router to expose your external HDD in a variety of ways:\n\n1. It can be a DLNA server like I was describing above.\n2. It can be exposed as a file-server. (Just map it as a network location on your PC)\n3. It can be exposed as an ftp server to securely access the files over the internet using a standard browser/ftp client.\n\nThere is a USB 3.0 port, so if you have a HDD that supports USB 3.0, you can have a really fast NAS (Network attached storage)! (There is a USB 2.0 port too, of course).\nMy HDD is an older one and supports only USB 2.0, but I can still simultaneously stream HD movies onto multiple devices using Twonky, VLC etc. or directly on my Smart TV. (Basically any device that will see and play DLNA content).\nI also have the HDD as a mapped network location on all my computers, so that I can quickly share files across devices.\nYou can also set up your favorite backup utility to backup important content from all your computers to this external HDD connected to your EA7500. That way everything is centrally available.\n\nOverall impression:\n\nI can definitely say that the switch-over to this router has shown dramatic speed improvements for me. In addition to speed and coverage improvements, being able to attach an external HDD and have it stream high quality media to my devices and having my personal little \"cloud\" service has been tremendously useful.\n\nIf you are looking for powerful WiFi coverage all across your house/office without using extenders and such, and also if you want to centralize all your media and/or documents to access them from various devices on your network and even over the internet, this router is for you.",

                "review_body": "[See 1/21/14 Update below]\n\nAs noted above, I upgraded from a D-Link DIR-655 router, which was a good piece of kit and did its job well, but this EA4500 is more than an incremental improvement.\n\nSET UP\nI'm fairly tech savvy, so I'm not afraid of a challenge, but this thing coddled me like I was an AOL user and just got the job done.\n\nIt's an extremely easy set up.  It sniffs for your internet connection, sets it up, and basically gets itself comfortable and up and running with very little need for anything from you. Heck, I used the same SSID as my prior router and many devices (like my Tivo, iPhones, and Macbooks) connected to it like there had been no change in router.  If it weren't for a pain-in-the-butt webcam, I would have been fully set up within 15 minutes.  The other 4 hours were purely the fault of my Foscam (and only related to setting up that device)!\n\nBack to comparisons with my DIR-655:\n\nSPEED/THROUGHPUT - Per either the router app's built in speed tester (very cool, as is the automatic firmware upgrade option, if desired) or speedtest.net, I went from something like and average of 25 over 10 Mbps to 43 over 25 Mpbs.  Finally, efficient use of my advertised Verizon FiOS connection!\n\nRANGE - Our house is about 1600 square feet, but it was built in 1942, meaning plaster and other Frankenstein structural components abound. My DIR-655 was barely making it to the middle and back of the house (router is in the front) with a serviceable connection, such that my wife (who is typically in middle or back and was losing connection) was very frustrated at times.  Based on my speedtests on her computer in other parts of the house, I don't think she'll be cursing our network anymore.  So far so good. Also, that cursed (just in terms of set up) Foscam webacam is showing a much better video feed both in the house and via remote view on port forwarding.  That was an unexpected bonus.\n\nSOFTWARE - Cisco/Linksys are definitely trying to make it an easy/pleasant experience to manage the router, but I (and I'm sure many others who would use a piece of kit like this) won't to go beyond the glossy top level management app.  So I was pleased to see that I could indeed jump over to a much more detailed device management interface, much like you'd see with the DIR-655 or other routers. I'm still getting used to the different menus, but it looks like just about everything is there.  I'm having a hard time finding the status/MAC address/etc. of all connected devices (such that I had to use a separate IP sniffer when setting up the webcam) but I have to believe it's there somewhere!\n\nOverall, it was absolutely money well spent to move up to this device.  Will try to remember to follow up after I've used it for a couple months.\n\n:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n[JANUARY 21, 2014 UPDATE]\n\nOkay, sorry, that was more than a couple months!  Well, I must admit that I have since gone to the Dark (Knight) side.  Things weren't as rock solid after a while (I'd say about a year into owning this router), i.e. we were back to my wife complaining of a \"slow computer\" (which always means internet access and speed) from the back rooms of the house, furthest from the router. After tinkering with the router, and realizing there wasn't much I could do aside from moving it to a more central location(not that feasible), I felt I owed it to her to look around at options a bit more, and decided to try the ASUS RT-N66U (http://amzn.com/B006QB1RPY) due to: (i) it's cult status and (ii) the open source nature/hackability of its firmware.  I must admit that I fell in love with the ASUS pretty quickly and, after having it as long as, if not longer than, the Linksys, it remains rock solid with no wifi speed/connectivity (especially if I stick to 2.4GHz in the back rooms).  This is really more about my fickleness and desire to try new/different tech than a knock on the Linksys (which I still have and will use in some support capacity some day, most likely), but there is no doubt that the ASUS ended up a much better solution for my needs, and I am sure the AC version of the ASUS router will be my next purchase, when I have the need.",

                "review_body": "After much time consuming effort, installing this new router has been worth the effort. The biggest problems were solved when I chose to change the channel to number 4. After making that change, I have had no problems, and my Squeezebox Radio no longer drops connection to the router. I am happy now that I bought this new router.\n\nWith this new router, I can now print to an HP printer and a Brother printer from two computers, which I could not do with my previous router; so, that makes the change to this router worth the effort.\n\nAfter successfully installing this router, I upgraded my two computers to Windows 8, and I have experienced no issues or problems with the router. The router also works well with our tablets, Nook, Kindle, and iphones and android phones. We can also watch Netflix over our TV with no issues. The Guest feature works well also.\n\nThe information below may help some who are having issues with this router (see the helpful comments to me too), so I will leave the history below. [Date: November 3, 2012]\n\nEdit 1: Based on the three replies to this review, I am trying one more time to make this router work reliably. And, BTW, I do appreciate all of the comments and suggestions! I have made the network settings changes suggested by the first commenter. I would truly like to revise this review with a successful outcome! I will report back. Thanks for all of your help!\n\nEdit 2: The EA6500 has been up now for almost the entire day, but it has taken me almost two full days to set up this router so it would not have problems (described below in my first review). Without Comments made to my Review that helped me, the router would have been returned to amazon.com tomorrow.\n\nConnected to the router are a wireless Brother printer and an HP printer connected via USB to the router. Both work fine now. The scan function would not work in the HP F4280 printer until I uninstalled and reinstalled the printer software (though there might have been an easier way to get the scan function to work). Prior to reinstalling the printer software, the printer would print, but not scan. All tablets, iphones, TV, DVD players, and networked computers now work fine. Two iphones are connected as Guest (with no problem), and one iphone is a connected device (with no problem).\n\nThe Squeezebox radio only connects to mysqueezebox.com when my computer is on, when it should connect to mysqeezebox.com directly through the router, but I think this may be a Squeezebox issue and not a router issue. I am pursuing a solution.\n\nI have \"upped\" my rating from 1 star to 3 stars because I do not believe this router setup procedure that I have gone through for reliability is something some users would persevere through to the end. IMO, the default setup parameters should be similar to the suggestions of the first person to post a reply to my 1 star review, with more advanced features implemented by more advanced users.\n\nEND of Edit 2. (I will leave my first complaint below for historical reasons).\n\nBeginning of a negative 1 star review. Revisions are \"Edits\" above.\n\nI thought I would replace my WRT54G2 which was working fine with this new EA6500, because I liked the new advertized features. What a horrible, horrible mistake. Everything connected fine, and all devices worked as expected. HOWEVER, I continually lost network connections. Devices would drop off of the network. After the network would go down, the computer would freeze and require a reboot over and over again after a few hours of happy computing. I had every device working fine about three times at least, with a lot of time spent setting up printers, iphones, tablets, squeezebox, only to have the network go down and all of the devices loose their connections again, requiring a reboot of the computer or reset of the router. Now, I am replacing my WRT54G2; but, I will replace it with anything but a Linksys/Cisco router. What a waste of my time and money! Thankfully, I bought this router through amazon.com, and I will return it on Monday (just as some other reviewer did about a week ago!). I wish I had believed the other bad reviews I read here! I just chose not to believe them, because the WRT54G2 router had served me well in the past. I would give this EA6500 router ZERO stars if I could, just because it is not reliable and has been exceedingly frustrating, when I had been used to reliability and trouble free networking in my WRT54G2 in past years. I do not think I have ever written such a negative review of anything before, but the EA6500 deserves every word.",

                "review_body": "This router replaced a Linksys WRT1900AC v1 I had for 2+ years. This new EA9500. The second you open the box. It feels and looks like a very premium product. Kudos to Linksys on the incredible build quality. But that is nothing new. It has always been like that with their routers. I was not even hooked up yet and I was impressed on that alone once again! Getting it setup. One word. EASY! It just does not get any simpler then this.\n\nOne thing I have liked about Linksys routers. They are so simple to setup and work with. Anyone could do it. I decided to manually set it up as I always do with my routers. Before configuring any thing. Once inside gui page. I checked for a firmware update. One was available. I let it download and after it finished. I followed up with a factory reset with in the gui. I highly advise doing this any time you do a firmware update.\n\nOnce done. I setup up each of my devices with DHCP reservations with in the routers gui. Once all devices got configured. I followed up with a reboot of the router and off I went. I have the following devices.\n\n2 Desktops (wired)\nOoma Telo VOIP (wired)\n2 iPod Touch 6th gens (5GHz wireless)\niPad Air 2 (5GHz wireless)\nPS4 (2.4GHz wireless)\nPS4 Pro (5GHz Wireless)\nLG 65UB9300 4k tv (5GHz wireless)\nDell XPS 13 9350 (5GHz wireless)\nHP Envy Printer (2.4GHz wireless)\n\nEverything just worked. Before doing this review. I wanted to make sure it was solid. I gave it a full week hammering the network and not a single problem at all. Just does its job like it suppose to and you for get it is even there. I will say this though. I do have a couple of minor complaints. Using the factory settings. On 2.4GHz band for the channel. It had selected channel 2.\n\nThat is a bad selection. You want non over lapping channels. I manually set it to 6 and it was fine. Always use 1, 6 or 11. The other thing is the network map and dhcp listings. It can be buggy. Duplicate devices and devices showing wired instread of wireless or wireless showing as wired. I brought this to Linksys attention on their own forums. 4th post down here http://community.linksys.com/t5/Wireless-Routers/Smart-Wifi-Network-Map/td-p/1055466/page/4\n\nI am sure Linksys will remedy this issue through future firmware updates. My other complaint. No real bandwidth monitoring. Asus, Netgear etc all have this. And what I mean. For you can see bandwidth usage in real time by device, per devices, daily, weekly and monthly usages. Linksys for some reason has not added something like that. This is their flagship router and this is a big overlook imo.\n\nEspecially with caps now a days. I imagine people would really appreciate this feature from Linksys. I would and hope its added to this EA9500 in a future firmware update. With those 2 minor complaints out of the way. The router has been great. Speed demon it is. Great stuff from Linksys. I also like the very strong warranty Linksys offers. We are talking 3 years 24/7 phone support.\n\nThe \"other\" guys do 1 year and 90 days phone support. It shows and tells me Linksys stands by their product and has faith in it. So in closing.\n\nPros\nGreat build quality\nEasy to use and setup. Pretty sure a pet could set this up! ;)\nVery fast\nReliable\nStrong warranty\n\nCons\nNetwork map can be buggy along with DHCP listings\n2.4GHz channel selection could be better with factory settings. Maybe lock in channels 1, 6 or 11 for choices or when bouncing around if interference occurs.\n\nWith out a doubt. I can highly recommend this router to anyone with out hesitation.",

                "review_body": "When I first decided to purchase a new router to replace my Airport Extreme which I had never really been completely impressed with, I did a lot of research since there are so many routers on the market. In the past I have owned routers from Netgear, Linksys, and D-link, and am surprised by all of the new players in the wireless networking game. After reading lots of Amazon reviews, browsing sites like C net and talking to some colleagues (I am a PC technician), the decision was made to purchase the Linksys EA 7500 which at the time had a decent rating from fellow Amazon reviewers.\n\nUpon receiving this router, I found that it was impressive looking with 3 sturdy antennae which could be positioned in any fashion that would provide the greatest signal strength. This was a welcome change to the Airport which only has an internal antenna. I was also surprised by how easy it was to setup the EA 7500, and once again it trumped the Airport in terms of both ease of setup and number of features that could be customized. What was especially cool to me is that the link lights on the back of the router could be turned off, and this is especially important as I live in a small apartment and sleep in the same room as my home office, so the fewer blinking lights at night the better. Another feature that was important to me and worked out well with this router is the versatility and ease of connecting an external hard drive to a USB 3.0 port. My 4 TB drive was recognized immediately, and at first I had no trouble streaming videos and shows from it to my laptop.\n\nAfter a few days the honeymoon was over. The first problem was recognized when trying to copy large amounts of data from my laptop to the networked hard drive. It didn't matter what size the individual files as the copy process would always get interrupted at some point during the transfer. The laptop was only a few feet away from the router at the time, but at first I didn't get too concerned as there were several factors at play and I wasn't able to definitively say the problem was with the router. A couple of nights later I was watching a movie that was being streamed from my network drive to my laptop and several times a message popped up that the connection had been interrupted and the movie promptly froze. At this point I became genuinely concerned, so it was time to do some further research. It appears that several people have recently reported problems with the router intermittently dropping connection, and to me this is unacceptable from a device that is priced at nearly $200.\n\nAccording to what I have read the solution to the intermittent network drops is to update the firmware although it appears that customers have had problems doing this, and they have had to download firmware files directly from the Linksys website in order to do a manual flash. I was able to update the router firmware through the Linksys Smart WiFi interface, and verified that the most current firmware version had been applied. After applying the update, the router seemed to work fine. Yesterday when I checked out a couple of websites on a different laptop a message would come up in the browser window saying that I did not have an internet connection, but a few seconds later the page would appear. A few hours later I was watching YouTube videos as well as soccer games on different streaming services and the video would intermittently freeze and then play again (albeit choppy) and the WiFi indicator on my Macbook would flash which means that the wireless card is searching for a signal. It is worth noting that I have both Macbooks and a Toshiba laptop running Windows 8. So far it does not appear that the firmware update has helped matters, and in today's electronics market I doubt that this issue will be completely addressed as Linksys will probably let this router disappear in order to roll out the so-called latest and greatest model. Sorry Linksys. I don't mean to single you out for this behavior as all manufacturers would rather just roll out a new product with all kinds of unproven features instead of perfecting an already existing product. I will continue to observe the performance of EA7500 over the next few days, but if the wireless drops continue I will return the router since if it is performing this poorly now, what will it be like in a year from now?",

                "review_body": "I've been doing remote computing and worked in the field of application software development and support from 1961 until I retired a few years ago.  This router is the first wireless router I've set up and tried to exploit in my home.  My network was using a four port 100mbps router configuration attached to a cable modem which I replaced with the E3000.\n\nI found Cisco Connect to be a bit too good at \"information hiding\" and managed to kill the security required for it to operate to provide control for \"non-advanced\" settings.  In the process of getting things working for my wired clients (configured as Windows for Workgroups with my own workgroup name, not the default) I had trouble finding the proper fields to get the storage attached to the USB of the router \"visible\" to my netowrk clients and am still unable to create files or rename directories on the 1tb USB drive I hung on the router.  When I went to chat with Cisco E3000 support, the overseas support chat human told me incorrectly that there was an option to use NTFS as the file system for the attached drive.  He instructed me to let the router reformat it and it took a 1tb drive and shrank it down to 900gb FAT. Cisco's documentation is thin for someone like me and lacks detail when it comes to a lot of the subtleties.\n\nIt currently seems likely to me that the only way I can move files to and from the drive is to treat it like an old-fashioned shared volume on a UNIX host which provides FTP support.  If this is the case, I will be quite tempted to return the router to Amazon or Cisco if their support organization can't provide upgrades to the firmware to make it possible to use it the way their support guy and marketing materials seemed to imply that I could.  I'm sure that there are nationalized version of the firmware for this unit and suspect that some are different from the ones being sold in the US.  I would hate to have to update my firmware from a UK support site or work in German to get what I need.\n\nSo far, a month into using the router, I have been able to use it with three different wireless devices.  My Samsung LED TV (2009 vintage) has infoLink support and by attaching the proprietary wireless USB connector they sell, I can get weather, news, and stock quotes off the internet via the router.  Unfortunately it looks like Comcast may have decided to block the free weather service as it was working and stopped recently while things from the stock market and USA Today continue to come in over the wireless link just fine.  I've had similar problems with them over the years ever since they took over a smaller cabel provider's infrastructure here.\n\nThe second device is an older Wireless G Acer 5000 portable.  This worked fine 'out of the box' and I used it to do the initial router configuration via combined wired and wireless connections.  The portable runs faster with both networks up at the same time!\n\nThe final device is a new iPad I gave my wife for her birthday this week.  It got right on the little wireless network and for some reason \"corrupted\" security keys in router memory the first time we tried to set it to use the secure network.  It worked as a \"guest\" until I finally had to reset the router from power off because Comcast had taken a lighting hit and my cable modem downstream of the router lost its' connection to their network.  When I reset everything, lo and behold, the security key corrected itself and I could once again use Cisco Connect to manage the router from my three network client computers. The iPad jumped right onto the secure wireless network I'd set up and has been working nicely except for \"glitch\" in on-line web based software provided by my ISP (comcast) which doesn't like apple safari for the iPad and won't let my wife put a cursor in the body field of an email when she is using the web interface outside of the comcast link I provide in the house.  There, hosted by my secure wireless network attached to Comcast, it talks pop3, sends and receives email, etc.,using its' own little built in apps which grabbed her address book data from her Outlook 2007 mail client on one of the hard wired computers when it was plugged in just fine.\n\nI am still working on \"tuning\" the two wireless channels and resolving a wierd issue with the E3000 which appears to the wireless clients as though the router is rasing and lowering its' signal strength during the time when a given client is using it.  Obviously keeping the router from \"polling\" for new devices which are not likely to become attached to my network by turning off some of the \"automatic\" options it offers as default settings should help, as well as other tweaks to the G and N frequency options to set them optimally for each of my \"regular client\" devices.  I'm still figuring out how to do this and Cisco isn't helping much...",

                "review_body": "Very fast, handles 23 wireless devices with ease, easy to setup, and has enough range to cover a 1300sqrft house and most of the street.\n\nI bought this to replace a D-Link DIR-810L router, which was dropping wifi connections and slowed to a crawl. My 30Mbps internet dropped down to .2Mbps, and no amount of resetting/rebooting/re-flashing firmware would fix the problem. I even replaced my modem to make sure that it was not just a crappy Xfinity Modem doing this to me. After reading several positive reviews of this product, and already being a fan of Linksys from past experience, I ordered this lovely router on friday.\n\nI learned that amazon apparently delivers on sundays in my city, as my shiny new WRT1200AC was on my doorstep before noon on sunday. Seeing as how my internet had been borderline unusable for almost a week, to the point where I had to order this over my LTE, you can understand why that made my day.\n\nThe router was shipped in a standard amazon box, with about 20 of those giant bubble wrap things covering every angle of the router packaging. So it's no surprise that the router box had no dents or scratches, in fact it looks like it was taken directly from the factory. The plastic wrap didn't have so much as a fingerprint on it.\n\nThe setup was probably the easiest of any router I have every used. Just screw on the included antennas, reboot your modem, plug the router into the modem with the included ethernet cable, and plug in the power cord for the router. That's the only physical setup needed, then you just join the network that the router comes preset with, and you are already online. I changed my SSID and password simply for security (and so I wouldn't have to type a new password into 23 different devices). From the time I opened the box and started plugging cables in, to the time I had customized my own network settings and could browse the web was 27 minutes flat.\n\nI have six computers (two Macs, four PC's), five iPhones, three Xbox 360's, three Apple TV's, two iPad's, two iPod's, a Blu-ray player, and an Xbox One all running through wifi. Not one device has dropped connection, and I can game stream from my Xbox One to my MacBook Pro (running windows 10 through parallels) on the \"Very High\" quality setting with no noticeable lag. (across my house and in my garage) I can do LAN file transfers between my computers at 103MBps over wifi. (Megabytes, not megabits) System link with three Xbox 360's playing Halo and Call of Duty work flawlessly. (even while using four wireless controllers per console)\n\nThe Linksys WRT1200AC handles 23 devices connected wirelessly with ease, I have no problems with anything now. The D-Link router had issues with multiple Xbox consoles running, and obviously keeping a solid connection to the internet.\n\nThe design is also a plus, while still being a running joke in the family, as it looks like a baby spaceship to most of us.\n\nThe only thing I can complain about is that it seems like the USB ports for hosting hard drive as a NAS do not work with enclosures. I tried plugging in an old hard drive attached to a SATA to USB enclosure just to see if the feature worked, and my router locked up until I unplugged it and rebooted the router. However, plugging in a portable Western Digital USB3 hard drive worked perfectly. So it may just be some driver incompatibility issue with my enclosure.\n\nRunning since sunday morning with 23 devices continuously connected to it, it hasn't dropped once and is still cool to the touch.\n\nMake sure you have enough space for where you are putting this router though, it's much bigger than it looks. The Linksys WRT1200AC takes up the same size as an Xfinity Modem/Router combo on it's side.\n\nOverall, a fantastic router with a great design and extremely long range. I am once again able to take full advantage of my internet speeds and use every device in my house at once.",

                "review_body": "I have been in technology for many, many years, and my expertise concerns Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) and telecommunications in general.  I work remotely from my corporate office, and I use an IP phone to talk to my co-workers.\n\nI have been dealing with the call quality issues that our customers experience mostly due to poor-quality routers for most of my career.  I've put hands on just about SOHO device out there, and Linksys has always been a great product for the small office.\n\nThe best part of this line of Linksys devices is that Cisco bought the company but kept the easy-to-use software management in tact, only changing the brand name.\n\nAll of these Linksys devices for the past decade have generally built on the same competent administrative interface, which means that every time you upgrade, you have a familiar experience waiting for you.\n\nOne of the nicest features for me is the QoS settings.  You can create policies by IP, port, protocol, and MAC address, and then assign a High Medium Low value to that device for Quality of Service.\n\nIn an office environment, if you had hard IP phones (like Polycom phones), you would want to put in the MAC of each phone and set it's QoS to High so that the router would automatically prioritize traffic from these devices over PCs and network storage, printers, etc.\n\nFor a home office, you would still want high priority for your phone, or if you were using a softphone on your computer you might give your laptop priority.  Of course, assigning the priority to your laptop would mean that youtube would compete with your voice conversations, so in this case it might be better to establish a port and protocol QoS policy.\n\nMany Amazon customers may not find this level of technical detail helpful when considering which device to purchase, but these are the things that matter to me when evaluating a router for my home office.\n\nLinksys / Cisco do some great things with repeaters, making it easy to have this device as your central router and then smaller access points throughout your home to extend the wireless range.  All that stuff works really well if you know enough to configure it.\n\nOne really cool thing Linksys / Cisco has been doing for the past few years is the guest access SSID for wireless.  You can have a secured wireless name for your family, and then a guest access that has it's own password or no password at all for friends or neighbors stealing your wifi.  But these separate SSIDs allow you to create policies restricting access so that a cunning neighbor cruising on your wifi wouldn't have access to your entire home network, and you don't have to give our your primary password to a friend who is staying the weekend.\n\nThis model of router goes a step further with simultaneous 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz transmissions.  Since the 2.4 GHz spectrum is so crowded (cordless phones, all manny of wifi router, etc.) sometimes you are in an apartment location where everyone has wifi and all the available channels have been used, so you get poor performance from your device due to the crowded airwaves.\n\nWith the dual 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz transmissions, you get tons of air space, and you can even have certain devices on 2.4 while others are on 5 in your own home to reduce the chatter on a particular channel.\n\nI have my laptop and iPad on 5 GHz, but the iPhones in the home are on 2.4 GHz.  I don't honestly think I've improved anything - we're only talking about 10 devices all told - but it's nice that this is a feature.  Plus certain devices that have older B/G antennas can't use the super-fast N antenna, but this router serves both devices equally.\n\nIn our home, we have two iPads, three iPhones, three Macbooks, one xbox 360, one Apple TV (2nd Gen), and one Samsung Smart TV (with wifi or LAN cable access).\n\nI have all of these devices networked through the router, and just to be a jerk I decided to start video streaming on all of them at once, then try my VoIP phone (laptop) to see if quality was affected - no issues at all.\n\nIf you have the $190 for the high-end model with 6 antennas - get that one.  I didn't want to spend the cash.",

That being said, I had to post a review given that I'm very satisfied with the process thus far.  I'll update this as time progresses.\n\nThis router was a replacement for my old WRT54G that served me well for about four years, but was acting up (dropping signal, slow connections, low range, etc).  So I decided to purchase this model (E2500 as a replacement).\n\nThe whole time before this new router arrived I was dreading the prospect of setting it up given my experience with my old WRT54G router.  As soon as it arrived, I followed the instructions in the packaging and then put the CD into my macbook to launch the installer.  The installer itself simply involved pressing a few buttons and then it did the rest!  My network was up and running in about five minutes- with the installer doing all the work for me.\n\nWhat I did notice was that the installer created a guest account that wasn't protected like the main one.  This concerned me, so I logged-in to the advanced settings using the router's IP address at 192.168.1.1 using my browser (you should preferably use the computer you used to setup the network because it's already connected to the network).  I think the default is to leave the login name blank and to use your default network password as your login password.  Once I was inside, I disabled the guest account, but it turned out that there was a password in place- it's just that it's browser-based apparently (your guests will be able to login to the network itself, but will only be able to access the internet by typing in the password in the browser).  So if you want to leave the guest access available, simply write down the default password that shows up on-screen or setup a new one.  I also changed the default password used to login to my router in here as well (under the \"administration tab\").  So, to clarify, the 192.168.1.1 address brings up a menu where you can modify your router's default settings to your liking.  I think this was a criticism of the \"easy\" setup- that it doesn't let you customize your router.  I actually see this process in reverse- the \"easy\" setup configures your router to work properly given your circumstances.  Once it's setup, you can modify whatever parts of the setup that you want to.  In my case, I only modified the router password, guest access, and my network key.\n\nOnce it was setup to my specifications, I proceeded to update all of my computers with the new network key.  I also connected all my other devices to the back of the router (there are four slots).\n\nIn regards to performance- my macbook that wasn't getting a signal with my old router works perfectly now.  That being said, it's a new macbook, so it's able to utilize the \"n\" band.  My sister has a 2006 white macbook next door that only utilizes G though- she's having no problems either.\n\nOverall, I'm happy i made this purchase and highly recommend it to others.  I don't own any other n-routers, so I can't comment on how much \"better\" this is relative to others.  I can only say that I'm happy I made the right choice with this one.  I'll make sure to update this review should issues with reliability surface.\n\nEDIT: You actually don't have to login to the router's IP address to access the features I mentioned above.  You can simply use the \"Cisco Connect\" software that came with it.  The only issue I can think of is that if you use this software, you can only run it through the computer you setup the router with.  The IP method above will work from any computer connected to the network (after logging in with password).  The con of the IP method is that it's not as \"user friendly\" as the \"Cisco Connect\" method.  Ultimately, you should weigh the pros and cons yourself and decide which is best for managing your router.  I'll be choosing the \"Cisco Connect\" method in the meantime just because it's easier to use, but I'll go back to the IP method should anything happen to my computer (where the Cisco software is installed).",

I could run DLNA, Tailscale,  a Network attached file server, and other apps  on it. It has a fast USB3 port for the disk drive interface.  The refurbished units look brand new and the price is great for the features.  CONS:  It only supports the 8 year old Wifi standards (I am not a gamer so I dont care) and  the USB3 port does not deliver USB3 spec for current.  Consequently the network attached disk drive was flaky.  I added a powered USB3 hub and every thing is rock solid now.  The range is not fantastic either but I got  Wifi extenders to remedy that.",

This one worked like a champ but a few months ago I started noticing that things were slower, a lot slower than usual. Our 4K TV balked and studdered at showing a 4K streaming Disney cartoon until we downgraded it to the bandwith saver setting. Then we had no internet whatsoever and we called the cable company. They sent a tech out after getting a new modem didn't solve the issue. By the time the tech showed up we did have signal but very slow. 1/5th of what our plan should provide. It's time for a new wifi router. This one gave us our money's worth so I'm leaning toward another Linksys router.",

                "review_body": "Well, I was excited to get this router and thought it will be as smooth as the 6years old wireless router which I had from linksys.\n\nFor everyone to know, it won't connect to your CABLE modem and figure everything out by itself. You have to use the installation CD to be connected. I found this to be weird knowing that the internet cable service from comcast has been active for the last 3 years. Why would I install everything using the CD, I don't understand.\n\nAs far as the dual channel, it does not work out of the box. The range is not really acceptable unless you change the channel on 2.4GHz. I found no speed gain with my N wireless connection on my Dell Latitude E6500. My iPhone, PS3 and another desktop - with wireless card - won't be able to connect to the router at all.\n\nI had to call customer support and they were able to set up the router for me. Apparently you have to use a different channels for your router to broadcast itself. Not only that, you have to change the security setttings from WPA2 Personal/Enterprise to WPA Persona/Enterprise.\n\nWith the broadcasting in channel 11 than 6 for the 2.4GHz signal, there is a loss in your speed. Also, I don't find any speed improvement for my new laptop with its N wireless card. It still shows 54Mbps on the 5GHz signal...\n\nI was able to finally connect all my devices on the 2.4GHz except the new laptop which is on the 5GHz...\n\n- As far as the storage goes, I was able to view files from the router's storage (for testing, I used 8GB flash drive with some video files in it). I viewed these files from my PS3 - it was able to find the media server on the network - but if I fast forward for a little  bit, it will cut off or even disconnect from the network. I find it little useful though.\n\nAt the end, as some earlier users mentioned: if you know what you're using this router for and you think you will gain all of its advantages, then buy it otherwise stick with the WRT54G latest version from linksys or others for $50 or less.\n\n=============\nUPDATES Nov. 10th 2009\n=============\nAfter a lot of setup tweaking on this router, I figured out how to use it best according to some many suggestions out there.\n\nTo get the best out of your 5GHz Band for N devices, change the \"frequency\" to \"40MHz\"; and if you want, make sure it only broadcasts for \"N\" devices. I was able to get 300Mbps on my Intel 5100 AGN wireless card on my laptop - next to the router. If I use the laptop downstairs - about 10+ meters away from the router, I get 162Mbps. That's still really good.\n\nAt the same time, if you're broadcasting your 2.4GHz, make sure you change its frequency to \"20GHz\" and set its standard channel to 11. There was no overlap and I was getting 54Mbps on my desktop computer with HP wireless card on it about 10+ away from where the router is located. The signal strength is 100% and it was good.\n\nOn the 2.4GHz band, my PS3 was receiving 97-100% signal strength without any dropouts. I started to like this router and hopefully with the new tweaks I will be able to use the USB port for an external HDD as a NAS.\n\n=============\nUPDATES Nov. 17th 2009\n=============\nFor some reason - I donnu - I was not able to connect my XBOX 360 via this router. I am using WPA2-Personal and enabled MAC filtering. I did all necessary steps and it still does not connect. Any expert can elaborate on this, please do so.\n\nOn my laptop, I see both my 5GHz and 2.4GHz bands. On the N wireless, I have seen many dropouts while working on my laptop. I am not sure why but it is really painful when I am working from home!!! Looks like others are having it as well... It might be just my wireless card.",

                "review_body": "When I received this router I faced some issue with 5G Wifi in 1st day and I contacted amazon for return and as usual amazon representative was very polite and offer for me refund and return the router process already started but during this period I contacted Linksys and do firmware update and now it seems this is brilliant router and I cancelled return process so let me told you about me experience with this router especially that I am familiar with Linksys and I used wrt1900 ac v1 before this, also my review may help Linksys to solve the issue that some USA costumer have with WiFi.\n I live in middle east (Jordan/Amman) and I ordered Wrt3200acm from Amazon last December and I got it on 30th,Dec,2017, directly I setup the router in my home I looked at the firmware it was 1.0.3.175384 which is the initial release, I keep it as it and start doing all tests as I already read about Wifi issue before and already communicated with Linksys and they told me that lets use the router first to see if there is any Wi-Fi issue, the router worked great except with some minor bugs,although Linksys advice me to keep the firmware and not updated until they find solution for the issue, I take the risk and install latest firmware from Linksys website version 1.0.6.181063, and it seems that it's working fine. Today is the 3rd day of using Wrt3200acm with no major or even minor issue, I tested each option in router and changing all sittings. Everything still working smoothly with great performance, except one issue that all Linksys range extender cannot see 5G Wi-Fi if you leave the channel in 3200acm to Auto as in this mode the router usually used channel 149 which is DFS and all Linksys range extender not support DFS (already contacted Linksys and informed me this) so I change the channel in 5G to 36 (you can use 36 to 48) only to make extender see 5G Wi-Fi.\n\nNow let me told you types an numbers of devices connected in my home network ,8 Samsung android mobile (most of them latest devices like note8 and S8), 2 Samsung Smart TV, 1 PlayStation,4 Laptop with windows 7&10, 2 Iphone mobile and 4 linksys access point or range extender as I have very large house) and 1 DVR camera with 5 full HD camera) and everything working brilliant with ISP 100M down/Upload I got 117M download and 101M upload with ping between 2-4.\n\nIf you compare wrt3200 with my previous router wrt1900 ac Ver1 there is significant improvement as I did many many tests, improvement in 2.4g in speed and range. improvement in 5G range around 25% better with 3200acm, no disconnecting happen to any device connected, also with1900ac I had problem in switching between router with extender or access point as the networking drop down then re connect now with 3200acm it's seamless like a magic no and never dropping in Wi-Fi with my mobile happened (I did within these three days more than 100 tests) even the speed and location in Linksys range extender that I have (EA6300, 1200ac) is show more speed in both 2.4 & 5 and the location between extender to router show me like I move the extender near the router), even wifi signal is STRONGLY STABLE(I am using Linksys high-gain antennas that I gave it before one star on Amazon as I used it before with 1900ac but it seems the high-gain antennas work perfect with 3200acm) , actually no thing in performance similar between wrt1900ac and wrt3200acm except externally they are the same in shape...I did many many speed and ping test the router was very stable and strong even downloading large amount of data through external hard disk connected to USP 3.0 in router was excellent speed and it did the job in short time, even connection speed between my desktop and router reach to 867.0 Mbps.\nalso I got BONUS Linksys AC600 wifi USP adapter as free with the package.\n\nI would like to share my experience with other users and with Linksys and I mentioned where I live in Jordan/Amman that may be the hardware or software of our android devices different than US even though that My Wrt3200acm is US version as I bought it from Amazon.",

I only bought because the router I was replacing was Linksys and I wanted to use it in bridge mode as an access point. Figured it would be less complicated staying within in brand and if there were problems support would not help because you're mixing brands. After setup you can use the browser to finish setup. I have a common password for all my routers and APs in the network. Now I have to change them all because Linksys does not allow repeating characters for the router password. i.e. Spaceshippirates1$ two Ps in a row. Throughput is good both wired and wireless. I really don't like when you try to make changes the default is to make you go through their website rather than direct to the router.

                "review_body": "There's no manual for the setup, and there are steps along the way that are not intuitive at all.  Starting with the website, the only option is to download the Samsung app to your phone, which took three tries and a half a day to finally appear.  The router does allow a minimal internet connection with the pink light on, but there doesn't appear to be any way to move on from that page and set it up online.\n\nSo, I finally had to call support, and thankfully I connected to a very knowledgeable lady in Malaysia or somewhere, who informed me you have to click on the picture of the smart phones, that moves you on.  Like, that was obvious??  A link didn't even appear until you click on them. Beyond that point she had to help me navigate three or so steps that I never would have figured out, one of which required me to get out a magnifying glass to read codes off the bottom of the device.  Why on earth is that necessary?  Why aren't all the codes and passwords you need in bold print in some kind of paper instructions in the packaging?  It's like corporate wanted this to be as difficult as they could possibly make it to setup online.\n\nAnyway, thanks to a women on the other side of the world, I did get it working, and it was easy to stop the wifi function.  I do not want to broadcast, I'm a hard wired guy.  And the router does its job in that function, my internet speeds out of the router are only slightly lower than when the PC was connected directly to the modem, no biggie.  But dang, someone in the headquarters needs to be given one of these things and asked to set it up on their own.  Then maybe they'll realize a little more help in the packaging might be necessary.",

                "review_body": "Having waited WAY TOO LONG to replace our pre-N wireless router I did considerable research to find a router that would give better performance and coverage.  Due to coverage area on our pre-N I had also added to two (2) access points over the years.  Additionally I have five (5) hard wired GB network switches cascaded off the router.  My motto is wireless is the network of last resort \u2013 if I can hard wire I do.  Even with using hard wire everywhere I can there are still a number of wireless phones, tablets, gaming devices and streaming sticks.\n\nThe recent release of the Linksys EA9500 with selection as 2016 Best of CES by Network World and overall very good reviews gave me high hopes for the device so I purchased it over other slightly older model tri-band units.\n\nTHE GOOD\nI am going to skip over all the stuff about features, size etc \u2013 that can be found in the item listing and several of the other reviews.\n\nVery easy to setup and get working.  As I was replacing an older device I had taken screen shots of all the critical screens (Router IP address, DHCP config, permanent leases, routing rules. wireless config etc).  Using the quick start guide I connected to the router and it was a relatively straight forward process to make the needed updates to router address (I don't use the default subnet), DHCP range, permanent leases, routing rules (I host my own personal server) and wireless config to allow all of my devices to connect.  After one reboot (for software update) and another for making a default IP range change it was up and running.  The router web interface is pretty easy to navigate and well layed out and looks like it is setup for new features and updates (I sure hope so \u2013 see THE BAD).  My wireless range and speed is night and day better \u2013 amazing what current technology can do \u2013 :)  The hard wired LAN performance to/from the Internet seems to be about the same as with my old router.  As I only have 30Mb Xfinity my older 100MB router LAN ports were not being stressed.  The network map is a very cool feature and the ability to replace the discovered names and icons with ones that match the device is awesome.  I currently have the Guest Network off but like the feature and how it mimics what hotels and coffee shops use with the web page authentication \u2013 I may go back and enable at a later date.  The rule setup was easy and a major improvement over my older router.\n\nTHE ODD & ANNOYING\nThe Linksys Smart WiFi account login occasionally doesn\u2019t work \u2013 this happens on my hardwired desktop, Android phone and iPad.  I get a message about service not available or router not supported.  If I try the local admin PW it works fine on the PC and sometimes on the mobile device.  I am hoping this is just some sort of bug and will be fixed in a future release.  Also for no reason I have been able to determine the web portal on my desktop will just stop working.  When you click on option (say connectivity) a box pops up but will never populate.  Then if you logout (which sometimes doesn\u2019t work when this issue occurs) it won\u2019t reconnect for some period of time \u2013 I am guessing a timeout of some sort.\n\nTHE BAD\nOk here goes:\n\nThe portal and mobile apps are missing VERY basic router features/functions that have been around for years.  NO statistics of any sort related to internet, wireless or LAN ports and I mean NOTHING.  There is no information at the router level or wireless device or LAN port level.  You cannot tell how much of any bandwidth is being used (wired, wireless or internet) and have no information at the device level for who is using wireless bandwidth, who is using internet bandwidth, what wireless connection strength is, what speed/duplex your wired devices connected at.  You can't even tell which wired ports are in use. You have to dig too hard to find even basic internet provider information (i.e. IP V4 and V6 IP addresses) and can\u2019t see DNS info for the provider. These aren\u2019t new advanced features and in fact are at least partially available in lower end dual-band Linksys routers \u2013 VERY disappointing.\n\nLogging seems to be very basic and more or less real time.  You get no information on rejected incoming traffic \u2013 i.e. if someone is trying to hack/penetrate your firewall.  The only incoming logs reflect allowed successful connections (i.e. port 80/443 for my personal web server).  There is little to no historical and no way to point to a log server or at a minimum email logs on a schedule or when they get full - I had both of these features with my older router.\n\nI would also list as bad that there is no direct desktop agent/gadget to monitor usage but since you don\u2019t get ANY usage that\u2019s not really needed \u201cright now\u201d (hopefully that will be fixed soon).  While using a portal for configuration, device level statistics, log review etc is fine basic level utilization should be via an agent/gadget.\n\nOVERALL\nAll in all I am pretty happy with the router.  The performance and ease of setup is very good.  My devices all connected right away and my home server was back online after the rule updates.  The coverage/performance is outstanding !! I haven\u2019t done any antenna tuning yet which I expect to make my performance/range even better.  I did expect more on the web portal/mobile app and have already reached out to Linksys pressing for future SW updates.  I would recommend this router for those that just want to plug it in and let it work BUT if you are looking for even slightly more then basic features on the portal/mobile app you may want to wait until the SW matures.\n\nUPDATE\nAfter using the router more you can locate somewhat more detailed info about the LAN ports (basic connection and speed but no duplex information) also you can get the details related to internet connection.  This information is under the Troubleshooting/Status/Report.  Not sure why the hid it and it is just a pure text listing.  I would have expect a graphic of the rear ports on the router where you could hover or click on each port to get detailed information.\n\nUPDATE #2\nAfter several weeks of use and giving Linksys support multiple opportunities to help resolve my issues - I returned this unit and purchased another brand tri-band router. I am self hosting a NAS server accessible via the internet - this worked at setup and then worked stopped for no reason (even after multiple reboots) and then just \"Poof\" start working.  This issue on top of the almost non-existent monitoring/performance information was too much to deal with.  I was very disappointed - maybe future firmware updates will help this device.",

                "review_body": "UPDATE (2016-01-08):\nPlease read the full review for my thoughts so far, as well as a few details on the dropped connections (on my end, at least). My rating will not apply for everyone, and my personal experience with this router so far is probably somewhat different from yours. I rate it a 5 out of 5 because it fulfills all the requirements for my own use case, but I have NOT tested all of the functionality as it is beyond the scope of those requirements. I will update this review again if the situation changes.\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\nThe reviews for this router seem rather mixed, so I was a little worried, but since it was on sale for $40, I figured I didn't have much to lose. I should mention my use case for this router. I needed it for a townhouse, which is already serviced by multiple routers and APs, and bought it to fix a dead area that used to be serviced by an old WRT54G. After it shipped, I dropped a February 2015 build of DD-WRT onto it and so far, it seems to perform quite nicely. I should mention that DD-WRT isn't officially supported on this router, but some builds of DD-WRT for the ASUS RT-AC56U work, due to the two routers having similar internals. Do a bit of homework on this before attempting, or you may risk bricking the router. Haven't done any speed tests yet nor do I plan on conducting any, since there are no specialized requirements here (yet).\n\nI'm not sure where the complaints about this router's range are coming from, actually. Granted, the range is nothing amazing, but it's hardly bad. My unit's range not only exceeds the original WRT54G's by a significant amount, it easily punches through the building's thick floor and walls. It's actually kind of overkill for its job. Maybe there are some quality control issues involved and I got a good unit, but I'm inclined to think that the complaints about range are highly exaggerated. I should also mention that I placed it on top of a table, which may be helping somewhat.\n\nI will update this review if the situation changes.\n\nUPDATE 1 (2015-09-19):\nI hadn't noticed before, but this thing gets awfully warm compared to the WRT54G. I'm not sure if it's a problem with DD-WRT or if the router naturally gets this warm, but based on other reviews and given that it's a lot faster than the WRT54G, I'm willing to assume it's the latter. It's a little bit worrisome, but I'm not seeing any performance degradation, so the rating stays put. I also had intermittent problems with Internet connectivity, maybe once every 5 to 10 minutes. I was actually prepared to knock out a couple of stars for that, but I did some research first, and after adjusting the wireless channels and firewall settings, it seems to be behaving itself now. The connection issues might have been totally unrelated to the router anyway. I will update this review if it starts dropping connections again. The USB printing doesn't work for me. Since I'm not running stock firmware, this is hardly surprising and I will not change the rating for that. The range of this router is also a bit lopsided, as some people have suggested. It seems to have better signal from the front of the router than from the sides.\n\nUPDATE 2 (2015-10-06):\nIt still drops connection once in a while, but not so much that it's really problematic. The 4* rating stays and I think I can adjust the settings to resolve it.\n\nUPDATE 3 (2015-11-25):\nAfter some further assessment, it actually appears to be the WiFi driver on my computer that causes the dropped connections. This thing might be better than I thought it was. Still not willing to push it to 5* yet, though.\n\nUPDATE 4 (2016-01-08):\nCan all but confirm that the dropped connections are a result of my WiFi driver. For this price point, I'm going to increase it to 5*. Please note that this change of rating reflects how the router fulfills my own personal use case, and may not apply to you! It meets all the requirements that I had of it - a 802.11ac capable DD-WRT router that's inexpensive, stable, and has passable range. However, I still don't know how the router performs without DD-WRT, and I still don't know how well the USB port works (I have never needed it). Now that I know what's causing the problems on my end, I can resolve them.",

                "review_body": "I have read a short review on here saying you must avoid this router if you have an Apple computer. I have 4 Apple devices connected to this thing (an Apple desktop, 2 MacBooks, and an iPod Touch) along with a wireless printer and my Xbox 360.\n\nCisco doesn't provide an installation disc optimized for an Apple computer, so if you need help setting up your WRT54G(L) router with an Apple computer, here are steps for a basic setup:\n\n1. Obviously with both devices plugged in (with the power light solid on the router) connect your Apple CPU to the router via ethernet cable, but the ethernet cable must be inserted in either slot numbered between 1 and 4. DO NOT plug the ethernet cable from your computer into the port that says \"Internet.\" Not that anything bad will happen, you just won't be able to setup your router through that port.\n2. Open up a web browser and type 192.168.1.1 in the address bar. Proceed by leaving the name blank and type \"admin\" in the password field. By default, your destination should be in the Setup tab and the Basic Setup sub-tab.\n3. In the Setup tab, go to the MAC Address Clone sub-tab. Click Enable. Click Clone Your PC's MAC. Click Save Settings. Click Continue.\n4. This step may not be necessary, but to be safe, go to the Status tab, then by default you should be taken to the Router sub-tab. If the IP Address is 0.0.0.0, click DHCP Release. Click DHCP Renew. Click Refresh. You should now see numbers other than straight zeros. (NOTE: This step is only applicable if your modem is already connected to your router via ethernet with the ethernet cable plugged into the \"Internet\" port (with your Internet connection on and running).)\n5a. For wireless security, click on the Wireless tab. By default, you should already be taken to the Basic Wireless Setup sub-tab. In the field where it says \"linksys\" next to Wireless Network Name (SSID), go ahead and personalize your router's name. Click Save Settings. Continue. (Unless you're connecting a Nintendo DS to your router, you may want to change your Network Mode to G-Only, and if you're having issues with speed, you may need to toggle the Wireless Channels until you find a speed that works for your device.)\n5b. In the Wireless tab, go to the Wireless Security sub-tab. You may choose whatever security mode you'd like, but I've chosen WEP with 64 bits 10 hex digits and in Key 1 have typed in a 10 digit personalized password. Depending on the firmware, you may only be allowed to use numbers 0-9 for your wireless password. Click save settings. Continue.\nAnd you're done!\n\nIf you're a parent and don't want your children to hack into your router, you may want to change the password from \"admin\" to something of your choosing by going to the Administration tab and Management sub-tab (you'll see 16 * symbols, but the password is still \"admin\" at this point). Be sure to click Save Settings. If you ever forget this personalized information that you've set up for your router, there is a reset button on the back of your router which will restore the router to factory defaults. Just note that your child is just as capable of hitting this reset button, in which case if they do, I hope you punish them by canceling your next trip to Disneyland. You can also change the Local IP Address on your router, but as smart as children are these days, they can easily figure out what your new Local IP Address is so I don't know if it's worth the effort.\n\nAs for gaming, on the very box this router comes in, Cisco will tell you that this router isn't the best one to get for multiplayer games (not sure if they mean online or offline) but I have my Xbox 360 plugged in directly to the router via ethernet for Xbox Live. I mostly play Halo Reach. I don't experience any lag when I play matchmaking, but I do experience a lag when I play co-op campaign via Xbox Live unless I'm the host (though I don't receive any lag with the co-op campaign on Halo 3 or ODST). That could be the router, it could be my ISP, it could be the game, but I'm not really sure what it is; I can't say that I really care all that much. If you're a basic gamer, I'm sure this router will do, but if you're an extreme gamer and want the absolute best of the best, you may want to get an N-router.",

Other than that, the supplied cable is solid.\n\nThe layout of your house, locations of other electronics (signal interference), and the location of your wifi router can and will affect the performance of any wifi router.

                "review_body": "I was an early adopter to mesh technology as I wrestled with an exceptionally difficult home over 200 feet long, steel-framed, a couple of concrete walls and the Internet connection wired to one side of the house.  I needed a whole home solution, encompassing the home, backyard pool controller, and a large garage where I have an Internet TV for exercising diversion.  The Velop WHW03 TrI-Band mesh network with a parent and two nodes worked OK but I had drops and restarts 1-2/month.  That was installed January 2017.  So I decided to try another Linksys node to see what would happen but didn\u2019t want to spend much for it.  So I surfed the eBay and found comparable notes selling there.  But then I also checked out Amazon and came upon this \u201crenewed\u201d one. More expensive, but \u201cCertified by Linksys.\u201d  So sprung for the $25 more and ordered it up.  Came overnight. Wow. Sealed box (not the original) with the Linksys seal of certification.  All parts there and \u201clike new.\u201d Adding it as an additional node was easy using the Linksys app.  I noted that the software was current on the node and didn\u2019t even need an update.  I have 47 devices connected to the mesh.  My download speeds are in the 600-700Mbps range, 35Mbps uploads. I have 1 Gbps Internet service coming in to the house. So far seems more stable.  I\u2019m very happy with the \u201crenewed\u201d Amazon service and price and would order renewed again.  Not afraid of \u201crenewed\u201d by Amazon any more.",

I didn't even care about WiFi (though my family does).  I was surprised at how challenging it is to find something that meets this simple criteria, particularly in a name brand for a modest price.  Amazon and Linksys don't help with this search by mainly showing pictures of families on their phones instead of actual pictures of the router.  I let my standards slide a bit to have only four ports and include WiFi, but at least this one is rectangular with only three antennas instead of posing as an alien predator or its transport with eight!  I was relieved to be able to log in the old fashioned way using a full sized keyboard, monitor, and browser instead of being forced to finger swipe through a tiny screen.  The two lights per port help when making connections and testing.  I had to reboot my Spectrum modem before the Linksys would communicate with it, but since then it has worked continuously.  I am told the WiFi is much improved over the 15 year old 100 Mbps router it replaced.  To get the eight ports I wanted, I paired the Linksys with a refreshingly simple Netgear GS308E, which is even more rectangular and also has two lights per port.  The one I received was made in Vietnam.",

The issues could have been avoided if I would have listened to the other reviewers and followed the on line setup process. I have a Linksys WIFI 6 mesh router and a Linksys WIFI 6 mesh node before adding this Belkin WIFI 6 node/repeater. This information will come into play later. Now back to my setup issues. I followed the paper instructions that came with the Belkin which also works with the online setup. When you power up the Belkin there is a steady blue light that will start to blink. When it goes from blue to orange you look for the device trying to join your network. You accept it and your on your way. So I thought. The online process stated the setup was complete. The paper instructions stated that the Belkin should have a steady green light when setup was complete but I had a steady Blue light. I did a factory reset 3 more times before I decided to go to the end of the on line instructions when it stated when the setup was complete there would be a steady BLUE LiGHT! Now I\u2019m frustrated and loosing it because I go back to the paper and it clearly says green should be the final color of success. But I always ended with BLUE! I started reading the reviews of everyone who was successful at setting this up and the common theme is to just follow the on line setup. So I had been setup all the time and I thought I wasn\u2019t. Shame on you Belkin for having contradicting instructions. The next issue now was that it was actually setup and working but I couldn\u2019t find it on my network. Since this Belkin is not a mesh I couldn\u2019t find it because I named it after my network\u2019s name. The mesh setup was easier to view because when connected it took on the network name but automatically added an extra character or two for visibility. So here I go again with another reset just to rename the device and WALLA there it was. It\u2019s been a few days that I\u2019ve had the Belkin setup and it works great. It has never fell off the network and for the money I am very satisfied with this product. I hope this helps someone who is thinking about buying it. Just stick with the online instructions for setup and don\u2019t even bother with the paper instructions that comes in the box. Remember there is no green light.",

But, router won't save any settings or it gets stuck on the blank screen \"waiting\" forever.  Youtube videos show others can click on an option and it comes up in a second or two but mine won't.  Another error is that router keeps stating that internet is down, yet I can surf from another browser window or tab, like for this review.\n\nI've tried several different laptops, desktops, browsers, and operating systems, and 'no joy' with any plugged into this router, and even created a non-needed useless linksys login identity which just won't 'link' to this router either.\n\nI will RMA this failed unit and hope that the replacement works.  If the replacement works, I will update this review accordingly.\n\nUPDATE:\nWell, Amazon over-nighted a replacement router.  Same problems.  When using ANY browser(IE, Firefox, Chrome), Windows 7,8,10(and even XP) with the antivirus and any/all security settings turned off, I just can't make ANY changes to the router from its browser log in.  That's 2 routers in a row that can't be adjusted using a simple browser log in.  Besides regular 2118 errors and indefinite \"waiting\", the new router also has 2117 errors.\n\nBTW, you can manually download the latest firmware.  FW_WRT3200ACM_1.0.6.181063_prod is available for download and my routers shipped with 1.0.5.175944 which didn't not allow browser settings changes.\nIf you can't log into router, you can't update it.  The automatic firmware update(via Android phone app) doesn't see the latest firmware that you can manual download to a PC.  Auto update(via Android app) says no new firmware is available even though the downloadable, from the Linksys website, firmware is newer than what the router is equipped with.\n\nAdditional update and review, after battling with router #2 for a couple days, I decided to do another reset and just leave it alone.  After a few hours, using the Linksys cellphone app, it finally was able to update itself with the previous mentioned firmware update.  I would guess that the LInksys support made that happen.  That did the trick and after a reboot, router is now responding to my browsers.  I was able to config/save my settings and now the wireless network is working just fine.\n\nI don't want \"email\" log in, Linksys membership smart-wifi log in, or auto-anything-easy-quick config by default.\n\nLoses 1 star because firmware updates took a while to go from website to router's auto-update.\nLoses another star because router browser settings uses stupid silly \"pop-up's\" instead of normal browser pages like older routers.  Pop-up script can easily be blocked by a pop-up blocker or script stopper(that is, a browser with some security settings).  Pop-up's can also be stopped by aggressive antivirus-settings, browser ad-blockers,......  The engineer that wanted that should be fired.\n\nIn the end, this router goes from 1 start to 3 stars.  I don't want a \"cool\" router with apps and silly config page pop-ups.  I want a usable router that I can manually set up quickly, update as needed, and then put to work!\n\nLinksys, get rid of the pop-up's when clicking on ANYTHING when accessing the router's menus. What was Linksys thinking?  Every browser pretty much has a pop-up killer now.\n\nUpdate 12/22/2018:\nWith the latest firmware and selective router manual configurations, router has served well until drowning during hurricane Michael.  I'd wager most negatives reviews are caused by either older firmware, or not choosing the proper wireless options for your network.  Since it ran nonstop since the firmware update without issues, I've bumped up the rating to 5 stars.  If you buy this router, learn how to log into it(no quick setups or phone ap's), and go thru each step by step option.  Eliminating \"B\" and \"G\" wireless using only \"N\" or \"A/C\".... is good start, setting priorities and specific options in your phones, laptops, TV, bluray, audio receiver.....  can make your WIFI super fast, well managed, and safe.\n\nI replaced my flooded WRT AC3200 with the Gaming Router WRT32X(seriously lacking options and overly dumbed downed user interface).  It too works great but I prefer the config/options of the non-gaming router.  And, for better reception/distance,  Linksys offers high gain antennas which are about twice as tall, and provides exceptional capability an acre away in my work shed.\n\nCurrent Firmware for the WRT AC3200ACM is 1.0.6.186168, released in January of 2018.  If the router doesn't automatically update to this firmware, do a manual update.",

                "review_body": "I started using this router - the beginning of August, 2012. I had heard that the new software (Cisco Cloud Connect) was very intuitive and easy to use, despite some early controversy about it.  By the way, many of the 1 star reviews are based on concerns about privacy that have been put to rest by the manufacturer.\n\nThis router is among a select few \"state of the art\" routers offering multiple but simultaneous operation on both the 2.4 and 5.0GHz bands - each band is capable of 3 streams (connections). This is a so called 900 router (the current gold standard for home routers).\n\nMuch has been written about the new software - some of which was full of praise (including a glowing CNET review) and some of which is quite damning (including many 1 star reviews here on Amazon). The bottom line is that this software is wonderfully easy to use and any concerns that Cisco might be monitoring your internet activity have been put to rest by the manufacturer. Cisco has revised and clarified their policies to make it abundantly clear that this is a NON ISSUE. See Cisco's remarks posted right here on Amazon. So many of these 1 star reviews are quite dated.\n\nAlso remember that Cisco allows you to opt out of this software altogether and administer your router locally with no connection to Cisco or the cloud (internet).\n\nWhat we have here is a \"top of the line\" advanced router that is very easy to set up thanks to its intuitive software.  That is exactly what I wanted ---- because routers can be quite difficult to setup/manage, particularly the very best (and most advanced) ones. The EA 4500 is very easy to setup and is a true \"set and forget\" type of device.\n\nSo, what is not to like? The software and router are great and the fact that it can be managed in the cloud (meaning the router can be accessed via the internet) is largely unimportant. You will, most likely, just like me, simply set it up (using all or most of the simple software defaults) and forget about it! But for those of you who have the rare need to manage a router once it is set up , then you can access your router via any internet connection if you have passed Cisco's extensive security measures.\n\nAs of August, 2012, the other competing routers you should look at are the Asus RT-N66U, WD (Western Digital) N900 and the Netgear R6300. I based my choice on Cisco's very intuitive software and very good range. While it may not always be the best (according to professional reviews), it has a better than average range.\n\nWhat may confuse many future buyers is that there is a new DRAFT (meaning far from finished) standard that is coming to Wi-Fi and routers. You will see, no doubt, many new routers coming to market boosting of conformance to the \"draft\" or the unfinished AC standard (802.11ac). The fact that NO clients (meaning there is NOT ONE real world receiving device) that exists for this new and yet to be finished standard is never pointed out. While meaningless, every router manufacturer will start to bring out new devices, or firmware upgrades to claim  \"compliance\" to this new DRAFT standard of AC. You can, at least for the next couple of years, largely ignore this spec.\n\nIf you want a high performance router that simultaneously operates on both bands, can easily handle 3 simultaneous signals per band and works with all current standards and devices - then this is the one for you. If you want a set and forget type of device that is easy to setup ---this is also the one for you. Highly recommended.\n\nI should add this router also creates a GUEST network (a network that can never access your home files).\nYet, if friends come over, they will be greeted with an easy Wi-Fi connection. You can turn off this feature easily in the setup but it is a real convenience that most people will like.  Frankly, I doubt there will be many that turn it off since it is both secure and really convenient for guests. Yet to be fair, most other new high end routers now also offer this same feature. So it is not unique to this router yet a welcome addition to the feature set of most newer high end routers.\n\nI'm hesitant to give performance figures. What I can say is that I have a large home. This router is located on the second story of my home, in the north most corner. I routinely connect on the first floor, on the south most corner, with excellent results. By accident, I had created a worse case scenario - yet I get top-notch results. There may be even better performing routers available but I'll take the easy set-up of this one versus all comers.\n\nI guess you could say I am happy with my purchase.",

                "review_body": "Before I begin the review, here's a little background on me and why my opinion on this device is worth listening to: I am a computer science guy who has set up networks for the US Department of Energy. I have a degree in networking, as well as various certifications. Suffice it to say, I am experienced with setting up networks - both on the enterprise and home level.\n\nI have a network of seven computers in my home, hard-wired via CAT6 cables, and I also have numerous other devices (Xbox One, Wii U, Nintendo 3DS, iPad Mini, etc.) connected via wireless. Since this is fairly complex for a home network, it's crucial to me that I have a solid router as the backbone of this setup. I previously had a Linksys wireless N router, which served me well for about two and a half years, but it finally died, so I decided to upgrade to wireless AC when purchasing a new router.\n\nThe router itself is fairly standard fare as far as the actual hardware - you've got four gigabit LAN ports, one gigabit WAN port, and two non-removable (but adjustable) antennas on the back of the device. The antennas on the back of the router feel a little cheaper than I'd like, and I wouldn't want to adjust them frequently or place the router in an area where my toddler might play with the antennas. That said, if you're like me, you'll probably just adjust the antennas once and put the router somewhere relatively out of sight, so this shouldn't be a problem (and by itself shouldn't deter you from getting this otherwise excellent router). In addition, there is a USB 3.0 port on the router, allowing the user to easily add a fast NAS drive to their network. I didn't test the USB port, but it's nice to know it's there in case I ever wish to add more network storage to my home.\n\nLikewise, the router's software is pretty much exactly what you'd expect; if you've ever had a Linksys router before, you'll find essentially the same functionality here. The only way in which things are a bit different is where Linksys' new \"smart router\" interface is concerned. When you set the router up for the first time, you'll be asked to register the device with Linksys' website. Once you do this, you can access your router's configuration from anywhere by logging in to your account on the smart router site - even if you aren't connected to the network. It's a neat feature in theory, but if I'm being honest, I can't imagine more than one or two scenarios where you'd ever have reason to do this. For 99% of users of this router (or any other Linksys router with the smart router functionality), this will be nothing more than a pointless gimmick. Of course, you aren't obligated to ever use it, so it's not hurting anything.\n\nThe router works fantastically once set up, and has both excellent range and terrific speeds. This is a dual-band router, and by default is configured to broadcast two networks at once - one network for legacy devices (using wireless G, for example) and another network for your shiny new iPhone, iMac, or gaming laptop with a wireless AC chip.\n\nSpeaking of devices with a wireless AC card, using them with this router is a treat if you are lucky enough to own such a device. I frequently stream full HD video from my media center iMac (connected to the router via CAT6) to my iPhone 6 (connected via wireless AC), and the connection is almost shockingly fast. A full HD stream starts within seconds, and only pauses to buffer very rarely - and even then, only when there is heavy activity from other wireless devices on the network.\n\nFinally, it's worth knowing that this is indeed a refurbished router. I originally intended to buy a new router of the exact same model I'm reviewing here, but the savings offered by buying a refurbished model were too tempting for me to resist. The refurbished unit I received was in excellent condition, and came with an insert containing the default network name as well as the default username and password to configure the router. The device appeared to have been cleaned, and was in great shape - even with new protective plastic applied. It really looked like new, and I was very impressed. The warranty included with the refurbished router is only 90 days, but really, once you've set up the router and verified that it works, it's very unlikely that you'll suddenly develop any problems; routers tend to just work or not work. Also included in the box was a new networking cable (only CAT5e rather than CAT6, but for the majority of users, this won't matter) and a brief quick-start guide. I tend to stray away from buying refurbished or recertified products, but I am quite happy with my purchase of this router, especially since it was essentially half the cost of buying the same router brand new.\n\nThe final word: if you're looking for a great router with the very latest networking technology (wireless AC), but don't want to spend a fortune investing in a top-of-the-line router, the Linksys EA6350 is an excellent option to consider.",

                "review_body": "This router is nothing short of amazing! I needed to upgrade our house system from an older Ethernet router to a router that would offer both hardwired Ethernet ports (for the legacy Ethernet devices in our house, including my desktop PC) and also WiFi, but the catch was that I was hoping to get WiFi range up to over 100 feet in radius, and I knew in advance that this range is often not achieved in under-$100 WiFi routers.\n\nHowever, after a bit of online research into WiFi routers, my gut sense told me to pick this router, which was priced under $50. It arrived a few days ago, and I set it up almost immediately. The setup on my Windows 7 desktop PC was quite straightforward, but I do note that the Setup Wizard ground to a halt and failed after the installation of the all-important drivers, and I was not even able to close the program and its window until I used Task Manager to unload the application. I then tested the router, and it worked fine, even though the Setup Wizard had not yet completed. I note that several other reviewers of this product have also noted that the Setup Wizard had also failed/frozen up on them while they were installing the router.\n\nI then tested the router performance a bit, and even though I used rather lengthy (12 foot long) cheaper older Ethernet cables to connect the router to the cable modem (we have very fast Comcast cable modem service, and a very fast Motorola cable modem) and to connect the router to my PC, I noticed immediately that the speed/bandwidth, via Ethernet cable, and also via WiFi, was obviously considerably faster than had been the case my older router, which had always offered very adequate speed/bandwidth.\n\nI then tested the WiFi range indoors. Our house is an older wooden house which has a footprint of only about 1600 square feet (including an enclosed porch), and, while walking around with my laptop, I noticed that WiFi coverage was great throught both floors of the house, and also on the enclosed porch, and also in the unfinished basement.\n\nI then decided to test the WiFi range outdoors, using only my cheap laptop and its admittedly-limited-range built-in factory-equipped WiFi antenna/WiFi module, because we live on a heavily-wooded lot (no lawn, only forested mountainside) I was also hoping that the WiFi signal might possibly reach my workshop, which is located about 125 feet from the modem's 2ndfloor locaiton in the house, and I was also hoping that the WiFi signal might also reach two enclosed meditation gazebos, which are located, respectively, about 130 feet and 160 feet from the house, with numerous intervening large trees, and also bushes, between each of these three structures and the house.\n\nTo my amazement, the WiFi signal strength in each of these three outdoor structures was very good; this was particularly surprising in the case of my workshop, which has wooden walls and roof that are heavily lined with foil/bubble/foil insulation, and there were also a dozen CFL lamps (which are known to emit RF inferference (aka RFI) which can interfere with WiFi signals) burning brightly the workshop at the time of my test.\n\nI then decided to try to push the limits of the modem's WiFi range, and started walking further into the forest beyond each of the three structures that I mentioned above. To my amazment, I discovered that the build-in WiFi antenna/circuitry inside my inexpensive 3-year old laptop was able to receive the WiFi signal (and still at a very impressive speed/bandwidth) out to a distance of at least 390 feet from the house (I did not try to go further, because I was tired of tramping up the mountainside in the snow), despite the fact that there were many dozens of large trees (and also bushes) in the signal path between the house and my varied test locations in the forest.\n\nI then ran some additional coverage range tests in other directions (since all of the above-mentioned tests had been confined  within the same 90 degree slice of the 360 degree coverage radius), all of them heavily forested, and these further tests confirmed that the signal reached to at least the same distance in every direction as had been found earlier, with the sole exception of one direction, where an intervening steeply-rising hillside/mountainside completely occluded the line-of sight path about 100 feet from the house; this limited the WiFi range in this direction to a bit less than 300 feet from the house.\n\nIn conclusion, I can say that this WiFi router vastly exceeded all of my expectations! It's performance continues to amaze me today, about 6 days after the router was first installed. And to realize that I paid less than $50 for this router at Amazon Marketplace. . . it is quite amazing!\n\nMy next step, since I have also noticed that the WiFi signal reaches the henhouse with very good strength, is to install one of my old laptops in the henhouse so that our chickens and ducks can surf the web whenever they wish.",

                "review_body": "I bought the MR9600 (aka AX6000) before Christmas while it was at 1/2 off the list price. Although there has been a steep learning curve at times, for that price I'm happy with it. Full price, though? I couldn't see paying that at this point. It's a first generation WiFi6 router that, imo, still has some kinks left to work out.\n\nWhat I like:\n- Better range than my old AC1750 router. In our 2 story house of about 3000sf, we have the router downstairs on one corner of the house with the master bedroom in the upstairs on the opposite corner of the house. The old router couldn't even push the 5GHz network up there, and the 2.4GHz network would usually only get about 20-30 Mbps speed. This AX6000, on the other hand, can pull 150 Mbps on 5GHz in the same location scenario. One of my motives in buying the AX6000 was in it's mesh capability, thinking that I might want to put in some nodes eventually to extend coverage, but with the new router it really just isn't necessary.\n- I wanted to like the 5GHz/2.4GHz integration (i.e. as configured out of the box you only see one network being broadcast). The router automatically evaluates the connection and switches to the better band (5GHz for best speed, if you are closer, but drops to 2.4GHz for better range if you are too far away). However see the negatives list below for the downside of this feature.\n\nWhat I don't like:\n- The first big issue I had was routine dropping of older devices from the network. The main culprits being a number of home automation wall plugs and a wifi printer. They would all see the network just fine and set up and operate initially, but within a few hours of first setting up they would drop from the network and not re-connect with anything short of a full setup from scratch again.\nAs noted in many other reviews of this unit that issue was solved by separating out the two bands, which negates the integrated band functionality I previously mentioned I wanted to like. If your wifi needs consist only of newer, higher end devices such as phones and computers then this probably won't be necessary.\nI, at least, had a hard time figuring out how to split the networks since the router setup app doesn't have a button or anything obvious to automate that. I felt a little dumb when I realized all you have to do is enter a different name for one of the two bands in the router setup and hit save. After that all my devices that wouldn't stay connected previously have now been running fine for many weeks on the dedicated 2.4GHz network, including through many cycles of router's power.\n- Device prioritization and the routers internal speed test app: This one got pretty wonky for me. The router has an internal speed test app that can be accessed from the routers Admin menu. I had understood that this was the \"trunk speed\", i.e. that it measured the full bandwidth available to the router, which would then be apportioned to the myriad of devices connected to the router. Each device then would have a speed test result of something less than the router's speed test. However after upgrading my internet service to 1Gbps down/35Mbps up, I kept still seeing 11Mbps up speeds, unchanged from my previous plan's speed test result. (Download speeds were within expectations.) I tried everything I could think of, and finally called the ISP. They claimed my service had been upgraded and it must be my equipment's fault. Finally I got a technician visit. On his specialty equipment he showed full speeds from my modem, but wildly different results when connected to the router. One speed test site would report 40Mbps upload while 3 others would report 1Mbps upload, or sometimes 11Mbps. To his credit, after he left our house the tech came back about 15 minutes later. He'd been searching forum reviews on his phone apparently and found someone who mentioned Device Prioritization as a source of a similar issue for this router. Sure enough, one click of the off button for Device Prioritization and my router's speed test app was reporting full plan upload speeds. Weirdly, though, after turning Device Prioritization back on, the router continued to report full speeds. What's more, speed tests run from our cell phones (which are not on the Prioritized list) ALSO now reported full plan upload speeds.\n- One other hitch to mention: Older 802.11AC wifi cards might not be able to see this router network at all if they don't have up to date drivers. My work laptop was one such case, but once I got my IT dept to finally update the 3 year old wifi driver they now work together just fine. I have had no other cases of any device having a problem connecting to the AX6000.",

                "review_body": "I purchased the RE1000 to extend the signal of a Cisco 4200 wireless router in a large home where I was not getting a good signal in the opposite corners of the home from where the original router was located.\n\nI tried to use the Setup CD and while it seemed like it worked, it did not / could not recognize the router.  After about 2 hours of attempting the automated and manual setup processes I finally got this to work, but I probably could not repeat the exact steps again if I had to.  The setup process is RIDICULOUSLY COMPLEX and UNDOCUMENTED.\n\nNone of the Cisco provided documentation or website support is useful in any way.\n\nA few notes:\n\n1) If you opt for manual setup (which is the only way I can get it to work), the security settings on the Range Extender need to be EXACTLY the same as the security settings on your router.  This includes not only the password, but also the security type (WEP, WPA, etc.)\n\n2) The \"Wi-Fi Protected Setup\" button is completely undocumented and I have no idea what this does or how/why to use it. Even following the steps recommended in the manual admin console it does nothing.\n\n3) The rate at which the Cisco logo blinks on the router will tell you if it is working properly or not. Good luck finding out how to interpret the different blinking rates/patterns.\n\n4) There is much discussion on the internet about needing to set up a Static IP address.  I did not need to do this in order to get it to work.\n\n5) There is a very important screen in the Range Extender admin screen where you click the wireless source you would like to pair the range extender with.  When you click the radio button it then pops up an OTHERWISE HIDDEN SCREEN which allows you to pair the devices.  The main screen should say something simple like \"Pick the router you would like to link the Range Extender with\" but it does not say anything of the sort. I think I clicked the right thing by accident and this is what ultimately was required to get the range extender to work.\n\n6) It is possible to reset the range extended to the factory settings (which I had to do about 5 times before it worked).  Good luck finding out this undocumented trick.\n\n7) Most importantly, and this is my favorite part, if you can see the Network Extender appearing in your list of available wireless networks, this means that it is NOT WORKING properly.  If it is working properly, it DISAPPEARS from your list of available networks and you only see the original source router.  When the range extender is working properly there is no evidence that the range extender is actually working (except the blinking logo, maybe?  Note: it also blinks when it is not working at all. )  This sure would have been an interesting tidbit of information for Cisco to pass along to consumers.\n\nRatings:\nSetup Wizard CD - F\nEnclosed Documentation - F\nOnline Documentation - F\nOn Screen Documentation in Manual Setup - F\nAbility to automatically ink with other Linksys/Cisco routers - F\nSignal strength - A\nConnection consistency - F\nSpeed - F\n\nMy recommendation is to buy the refurbished unit at half the price of the new one.  There are probably thousands of these things in perfectly good working condition that get returned to Cisco simply because they are too difficult to set up.  UPDATE - I do not recommend buying this product in any way.  In fact if someone offers to give it to you for free, save yourself the headache and respectfully decline their offer (and recommend that they destroy the unit so they do not give it to some other unsuspecting person).\n\nCisco does not deserve to make any money on this product due to poor documentation, lack of support, and generally horrible quality.\n\n==REVISIONS to intial review ================================\nI revised my initial review to include another \"F\" grade for connection consistency.  This thing contantly drops the internet connection but still shows 3 bars of signal.  This is the most unorthodox thing I have ever seen.  Even if you do the firmware upgrade and change it to Static IP address, as suggested, it drops the connection continously (every 15 minutes or so).\n\nAlso added an \"F\" grade for speed.  When the extender does connect to the internet it runs at about 1/10th the speed of my wireless router (3 mbps, vs. 30 mbps).  Basically this unit will pick up the signal from your main router and drop the speed by at least 50% as it transfers it.  So while \"range extender\" is technically a correct name for this unit, it does nothing to increase the speed of an already slow signal.  Whatever signal it picks up, it \"forwards\" that signal at 50% of that speed (best case).\n\n== Second REVISION to initial review ========================\nAfter messing around with this thing for over a week I finally got it to be marginally functional but still far below my expectations.  And it pretty much requires a degree in wireless network engineering to get this thing working.  Update:\n1) Location of Extender: The range extender is very tempermental and getting it in the right location in your home is critical.  To do this I needed to test it in about 10 different locations and use one of the \"speed test\" apps on your computer to test speed at various points in your home with the range extender plugged into different location.  However, you also need some other supplemental tool to see which router you are connected to because the Range Extender uses the exact same name as your main router.  You need something that will show you the MAC address of the device you are connected to (you will quickly commit this address to memory by the time you actually get the unit to work).  My range extender works best when it is as far away from my main router as possible (on opposite side, second floor of 5,000 sq ft home).\n\n2) Connection Dropping: As noted above, the range extender was dropping the connection (and still showing 3 bars!) about 10 times per hour on average.  This appeared to have nothing to do with the location.  I tried setting up the range extender with a static IP address and this did nothing to help.  I found another tip on the internet and set up a \"reserved IP address\" on my main router to match the static IP address I chose on the range extender.  This reduced the connection dropping problem significantly.  Now I am dropping the connection about once per hour, vs. 10 times per hour prior to that. UPDATE: yesterday the unit (with a strong signal from the base) was dropping my internet connection about every 3 minutes.\n\nWhen I was purchasing this product I was confused as to how there could be so many different reviews with people either loving or hating this product.  Now I know why.  Sometimes the configuration and placement works perfectly (for no good reason other than pure, random luck in the initial setup, router pairing and location of the range extender).  Everyone else hates it because there are 100 different things that can go wrong with the setup and there is NO DOCUMENTATION from Cisco-Linksys on how to fix it.\n\nIt appears from the reviews that 50% of people who purchase this product are extremely dissatisfied and/or return the product.  I cannot believe Cicso is doing nothing to rectify these issues.  They could sell a zillion of these things if they actually worked.\n\nSTAY AWAY FROM THIS PIECE OF JUNK!  Sorry to be so harsh.  If someone from Cisco would like to contact me, I'd be happy to tell you all the things that are wrong with this product.  Please schedule a few hours for the discussion.\n\nUpdate: I updated the firmware and the extender still does not work properly.  It drops the connection about every 5-6 minutes.  The maximum connection time without dropping that I have seen so far is about 16 minutes.  This thing is a headache.",

                "review_body": "I installed the unit to replace an order Linksys that I was working fine, but was 7 years old.\nThe unit worked for about 2 months, then I started to have issues that were af first intermittent.\nTHe router seemed to be working, but I assumed that the other connected devices were the problem.\nEventually, I couldn\u2019t find the router on from the PC.  The network control PC indicated no Ethernet Cable connection.  I checked that, by replacing the cable without result.  After resetting it because clear that didn\u2019t cure the problem.  After several \u201cfactory resets\u201d, the unit connected.  Then shortly thereafter the WiFI ceased to function.  Then the router became unable to located from the network and non of the devices seemed to function through the router.\n\nI called our tech support.  After trying to get it running, they said::\u201dRouter is dead, get a replacement\u201d.\n\nI called Linksys.  After a wait, I spoke with tech service.  They asked me the usual questions, asked for proof of purchase, then said before they could replace the deceive I had to speak with the tech to \u201ctroubleshoot\u201d the device. Please call a support number when I had the device \u201cin hand\u201d.\n\nThe next day, which was Friday, I did that.  After over 30 minutes of trying all the same steps, the tech acknowledged that the device was defective.  Then I was informed: We no longer make the device and we can\u2019t service it either.  They need to check with \u201chigher management\u201d to see whether they could get an or-equal device to replace it.\n\nIs asked what the device would be that would replace it with?  They gave me the model number.  It retails for the same price as my defective product, seemed to have the same specs, was only a slightly larger footprint, etc.  The tech said that his higher management wasn\u2019t available until after the weekend.  they would get back to me on Monday \u201cafter senior managers\u201d reviewed and approved the replacement.  I protested and said that my network was unusable; and, \u201cWhy should I wait until another 3 days goes by?  Seems clear: i) they acknowledged the device is dead, ii) I had it up only a few months after installation, etc.?  The tech said: Sorry, but that\u2019s our policy, I am am sympathetic and understand your frustration; however, that\u2019s our policy.  Don\u2019t worry we will contact you on Monday.\n\nAlong comes Monday, no contact.  Not depending on the International Date Line, I waited some more. Then sent an email to Support asking, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on\u201d.  Nothing back.\n\nNext day, Wednesday, I send another email indicating that in decades of having Cisco, then Linksys devices I\u2019d never had a failure, and didn\u2019t understand their responses.\n\nAfter a while, my phone rings. they asked what my problem was.  I asked if they had the files with all the information.  They didn\u2019t seem to have the proof of purchase, I sent them the transmittal email I\u2019d previously sent it them with, then after a bit they acknowledged that.  Then they said: \u201cwe\u2019ll need to have a tech need to \u201ctroubleshoot\u201d this to determine if the unit isn\u2019t functional.  I told that was baloney, look at your records which must be right on your screen!  After a little bit of \u201chold on\u201d and DO looping, they acknowledged that.  Then they said they\u2019d have someone call me with the details of how a replacement might be handled in terms of shipping and \u201cfilling out a form\u201d.\n\nI said \u201cwhat form\u201d?  I\u2019ll give you the address, you send me the replacement device, I\u201dm not waiting another three days over a weekend to have the shipping process start.  I gave them the address.  They said they would confirm the process after they \u201cspoke with the senior managment\u201d (or something to that effect.  I said jus call me and tell me you\u2019re going to get this shipped out on Friday or a Monday delivery.  I\u2019ll. have been without a network for too many days \u2014 and over 10 days since they agreed the device failed.\n\nI then get a call the next day.  Senior managment has determined that i) the device has been out of production for a while, ii) they don\u2019t have any of them, iii) they are not going replace it, and, iv) can\u2019t fix it because they don\u2019t have the parts.  I expressed my exasperation and told them that response was unacceptable.  The \u201csupport\u201d person said they could do nothing more\u2026and, (something to the effect that ) they \u201cunderstand my frustration and regret that I am experiencing it.\n\nUnbelievable.  It will be a cold day in Hell before I buy a Linksys device, depend on their warranty, or believe that \u201cSupport\u201d means anything to them.  They have taken a brand and \u201crun it into the ground\u201d for me.",

                "review_body": "I presently have a few routers:\nLinksys WRT320N\nBuffalo whr-hp-g54\nLinksys wrt54g (x3)\nAnd now a WRT610N\n\nThis WRT610N is a \"simultaneous\" dual band router.  That means at the same time it broadcasts a signal in the 2.4GHz band and the 5GHz band - key work is simultaneous - there are lots of dual band but that means one band or the other not both at the same time.\n\nThe 5GHz is nice if you live in an area with A LOT of other radio traffic (like an apartment) as it will give you some different channels that are not used, cutting down on interference.  However, the higher frequency  5GHz while stronger and can send more data has a much shorter range.  5Gz and the \"N-type\" routers are good for those that are physically close to their routers and need to send a lot of data.\n\nAt my house I wanted the dual band so that I could give a wireless video box it's own channel.  I have one of these Roku boxes and watch Netflix with it.  Video takes a lot of bandwith so with this wrt610N I let the roku box have the 5GHz band and then the rest of my wireless stuff (like laptops, wii, DS gameboy,  cell phone, etc) all have the regular 2.4Ghz.\n\nThe 5Ghz bandwidth radio network is only available in about \u00bd my house, where I can pick up the 2.4GHz band anywhere.  My point is don't buy N-type 5ghz because you want to extend your wireless range - YOU GET LESS RANGE it is faster but shorter.  Many people buy 5ghz N-type routers and then post a negative review and blame the router.  Like \"It won't connect unless I'm 10 feet away\" and my old wrt54G worked much better - stuff like that.  These people don't understand routers or the technology they are using.  As I said 5ghz has less range, but if you set up this router properly you will have two bands 5ghz & 2.4ghz.  This will show up as TWO different hotspots for you to connect too.  I've set up my laptop to automatly connect to the 5Ghz but then drop back to the 2.4ghz when the 5ghz is out of range.\n\nAmazon now is shipping the v.2 of this router, as of Jan 2010 - the router you get from Linksys/Cisco will have the newest version of the firmware.  It is wise to check linksys's website to see if a more recent version of firmware is available and then install it.  Upgrading firmware is really easy - you just download the file from the web, log into your router's admin screens and tell it to upgrade firmware.  Takes 2 min.  Note:  earlier versions of this router did have lots of problems with heat and re-booting.  My research is that these problems have been solved.\n\nOther notes:\n\nI'm big into xbox live and like most routers this has the DMZ feature.  If find if I put the IP address of my xbox as the DMZ address, or open the ports in port forwording, then I get  NAT type \"Open\"  on xbox live.  There are lots of web sites that tell you which ports to open (search NAT +XBOX).  However, now that I run mutiple XBOX's have found that out of the box this router is giving me \"open\" NAT on XBOX live on my two xbox's - without any port forwording or DMZ setup.\n\nThe linksys wrt320N router is dual band, but it can only broadcast one band or the other - not both at the same time.\n\nCon:  These new linksys routers  only have internal antennas.  I like external as then can add a bigger one.\n\nHere is my advice - don't buy the 610Ns unless you have a need for dual simultaneous band.  If you just want to get to 5G then the WRT320N will be fine.  If you don't have a real need for wireless N or 5GHz yet but just want a good router then go with the buffalo.  The buffalo runs dd-wrt really well.  I take the buffalo with me when traveling and use it as a repeater to connect to open networks (save on hotel internet charges).\n\nThe USB port will not drive a printer - but is really cool to hook up a USB hardrive that any computer on the network can use for storage.  I run backup software on my compters and have them put their backup files on this drive.  Or simply keep everything in the \"my documents\" folder and once a week or so copy the entire folder to the remote drive.\n\nI am a big fan of the  dd-wrt firmware, but my personal experience is dd-wrt is not ready for the WRT610N v2.  Using build 13401, I found that with both radio bands turned on, even in a very simple configuration dd-wrt would make the router go unstable after a few hours.  With only one radio it worked great, but I needed both radios, I went back to the linksys firmware.  In a few months dd-wrt will be work out all the bugs but for now the linksys firmware is fine.",

                "review_body": "I really have to disagree with the OP stating horrible firmware. Although (s)he lays out very specific issues that were found, I really have to wonder if (s)he is as knowledgeable as is being conveyed in the post or if the problem is with the the actual router. It may also be that the OP is using the open source software to control everything - I currently do NOT have the need for the open source programs.\n\nLike the OP, I too have had this router for about 2 1/2 - 3 years and have NOT had any of the issues that the OP states. I am using an smb drive that has been formatted ntfs (the router ONLY recognizes NTFS, FAT AND HPS+ - NOT ExFAT - this IS documented in the manual). As far as security, the OP is in error that ONLY Admin has rw privileges. When you set up the share, you set up the user name, password and access (r or rw[d]). You can share the entire drive or individual folders - not sure how many folders, but a logical guess would be 256.\n\nI've had at least 4 firmware updates since I purchased this unit so unless the op flashed the firmware with an open source version I really can't understand why his router isn't updating.\n\nFinally, I believe the op mentioned that the unit was incapable if keeping assigned names, non-browser items e.g., printers, scanners etc and constantly looking at internal ip's. I have numerous \"named\" items that have a dedicated IP address assigned (by MAC address) and they have NOT changed nor reassigned to a different device. Maybe the op isn't assigning a static ip via MAC filter which might cause this kind of error - dynamic ip addressing could give the same device a different ip each time it assigns ip's which in turn could screw up names assigned to a specific ip. Non browser related issues, again I have not experienced this issue and I currently have several different printers, scanners etc that have dynamically assigned \"static\" ip's that do NOT & did Not use a browser to get setup - just assigned a dynamically assigned \"static\" address.\n\nLast, but certainly not least, the op stated that the router ONLY used its internal linksys dns server and constantly pinged all the attached addresses. Once again, I have NOT experienced this issue. I use OpenDNS for my dns server and the router really doesn't care - maybe the op didn't setup his dns server correctly or possibly didn't point the router to the correct STATIC address of the dns server. This \"Could\" possibly cause the router to be seeking a dns server on anything attached to the intranet e.g., pinging every internal ip constantly looking for a dns server and when not found resorts to a \"known\" dns server hard coded by linksys.\n\nThe Only \"possible\" issue I've had with this router is the inability of Android file manager to find the smb share. No problem with Win or Mac items and I just found this issue late last night from a friend that uses an android phone. To be fair though, I really haven't had a chance to really troubleshoot the issue yet, quick search on Google regarding androids and smb on this router didn't result in any results.\n\nThis is a great, rock solid router that has over performed in every area I've put it in to. It will reboot if it gets confused but in my application this has only happened 2-3 times since it was put in service (2.5 - 3 years ago).\n\nOh, and I almost forgot, I've spoken to the linky support folks a couple of times - prior to COVID - and never had an issue and typically was on hold less than 15 mins (again, this WAS pre-Covid so it may well have changed since Covid).\n\nI have to recommend this unit if you A) are NOT needing a mesh system B) are NOT planning on using Open Source programs with this device - I really believe it would still work fine with the open source, but I have NOT tested this theory C) have researched known issues (or work arounds) with Android and smb drive D) want a corporate grade gig router with mu-mimo wifi - with the typical corporate issues regarding user friendliness during setup (unless you can deal with basic \"default\" settings)!\n\nHope this helps!",

                "review_body": "5-star product!  Utter \"Hell\" (1-star, if none at all) for set-up!\n\nFolks, I hope you have better luck with your set-up - and I hope my experience was an anomaly!\n\nMy Provider: Comcast (Harris County, TX) - very good service and signal strength for my area.  Typical hang-ups during the weekday hours of 6Pm to 8PM.  Over all, very pleased with Comcast.\n\nModem: New high-speed Motorola 2010 model year, installed November 2010.  This new modem is to compensate Comcast's broadband speed improvement/upgrade in early 2010. This modem was an improvement from the older modem, 2006 version.  Noticeable Wi-Fi sped on my old Netgear G-router, about 2x.\n\nReplacing Old Router: Netgear RangeMax VPN v2, single band G.  I had no problem with this router - my thought was - with a new upgraded/improved modem, I would benefit with a duel-band N-band.\n\nSo here goes...\n\n530PM: I unplugged my old Netgear and replaced with the new E3000.  I followed the USER FRIENDLY (my arse!) guide using my Mac as the installation platform.  During the installation, the Mac indicated that it was NOT picking up the router signal.  Of course, I tried again... and again... nothing.  Confusion set it (we've all been there!) - the dreaded  `personal doubt on  one's ability to perform a USER FRIENDLY task' began to rear its' ugly head.  I consulted the Linksys website - with (of course no answer) and no 1-800 technical support (keep reading)...\n\n600PM:  I set the Mac aside - now using my Sony Vaio (the dreaded Windows product!) as the installation platform, no difference!  Not pick up a router signal!  My mental thought pattern was now looping the initials \"WTF\" again and again... and again!  I performed this task repeatedly on the Sony several times causing elevated depression and anger (the proverbial first to steps of grief DABDA) - and I'm sure a spike in blood pressure.\n\n620PM:  I have now given up!  I disconnected the E3000 and reinstalled the old Netgear RangMax.  A new problem!  Now what?  Both laptops were not picking up any signal from the Router.  Again, looping initials \"WTF\", etc!  I hard wired (Ethernet cable) from the Motorola Modem to the Sony.  Yes!  Internet still works - but no Wi-Fi.\n\n630PM:  Thoughts of the moniker USER FRIENDLY, now a figment of someone's imagination.  I contacted Comcast, and a very kind `American', English-speaking Houstonian (in fact) helped me out.  \"Kudos\" to Comcast's training - because this young lady was very (1) patient with me and (2) technically proficient.  Apparently the new Motorola Modem is finicky when unplugging the existing router and installing a router - in this case the E3000.  She circumvented the issue by `pinging' my Modem using a re-set function (2-3 minutes).  Now, my Netgear (old router) works again.  Images of retuning the E3000 was now introduced to semi-logical sequence of thought.  We then tried the new E3000 set-up.  Verdict: Nothing!  No signal from the new router.  Now about this time, thoughts of (1) returning to the Amazon site, (2) printing out the return package UPS form and (3) driving past the UPS store to drop off the package - was about to be introduced to my `things to do list'.  Just about the time I was going to hang up with the Comcast agent, I asked her for the Linksys 800, if indeed she had it.  And she did!  So (readers of this blog - get your paper and pencil ready) the technical support for Linksys is 800-326-7114.  This is not available in the Linksys website.  Again, Kudos to Comcast.\n\n720PM:  I called Linksys (on hold for a mere 5-minutes).  During this holding period, thoughts of a dreaded Bollywood sounding technical support person kept me on edge.  The person who actually answered the call was a very good, English speaking Filipina.  Again, luck was on my side today: She was patient and technically proficient.  The culprit to this (going on 2-hour) fiasco was the IP address.  Apparently, disconnecting the Old Router from the finicky Modem re-initialized the IP address.  Why?  Who knows?  \"Death to the firmware architect\"!  Using the Mac as the install platform, we hard-wired the Ethernet cable from Modem-to-Router and Router-to-Mac.  Using the Safari web browser, I typed in the IP address (Mac: found in Settings, internet access).  The address was a back-door to the E3000 firmware. This sounds complicated.  And Yes... it is complicated!  At this point I'm just following orders - similar to me commanding my dog to `sit'!  NOTE: this was NOT in the USER FRIENDLY instructions.\n\n820PM: After running the gambit and going to the gyrations (I'm not going write the details on this one) my Mac finally picked up the router.  She stayed on the line as I performed the set-up, etc.  I also tried the signal on the Sony.  Yippee!  Wi-Fi once more! Overall speed (none to quantify) was noticeably much better going from G to N-band.\n\nLESSONS LEARNED:  (1) Have the phone number of your internet provider and (2) Linksys on hand during set-up, just in case.  You never know!  Here's the Linksys number again 800-326-7114, good to have. (3) Proceed with caution when using a USER FRIENDLY instructions.\n\nLINKSYS E3000: THE PROS: Over all speed improvement, very noticeable.  THE CONS: (1) Read above (2) I very much liked the vertical-stand design of the Netgear (old router) - occupies less space, when compared to the E3000.\n\nHope my experience helps you!  And good luck!",

                "review_body": "First of all, I'm not a tech person. But I do know enough (as some would say) to get in trouble because I don't know enough. I sort of learn as I go and have been forced through errors to go and learn how to fix what I messed up. So, I know some things, but not all or the why's or what-it's-for's.\n\nOur router was about 12 years old. You all know the story. we were being outpaced by the gadgets and it was time to upgrade and catch up with technology. I saw this Linksys AC1900 MU-MIMO (Certified Refurbished) and jumped at it. It arrived in perfect condition, well packed and protected. It came with a new power cord and Cat-6 cable. If it didn't say refurbished in the title, I would have never known. It was easy to set up and get going.\n\nInstructions were mostly clear. There were two things that tripped me up. One was that it said to power on. Plug in the modem cable and the light will stop blinking. (something like that.) I may have read it as Plug in the modem cable WHEN the light stops blinking. Once I forced myself to read and do in order, I was great. The other was when logging into the website to admin your router, the password is not the password to connect to the router. It's a different one. I glanced over that in the instructions seeing username/pw blah-blah-blah and didn't really read it.\n\nOnce i was in, I appreciated the slick user interface. I was able to prioritize who gets what bandwidth, confirm who/what was on my router and knew what needed to be reset to reconnect. I can't say anything about speeds. Mine is a more ethereal experience of I-feel-like it's faster. I tried a speed test, but can't remember speeds from before, so THAT's no help. I did run one just now, I get 14 ms ping, 70.42 mbps Down and 5.9 mbps UP. I have one constant issue with the CW app via Fire stick that didn't get solved - it buffers/hangs up every minute or so. It makes getting through an episode  of anything very tedious.  At least I've discovered it's not the router. :)\n\nI've only been running it for a couple of days, but I am impressed. I love the dual band, and I knew I wanted that feature. If you don't understand the dual bandwidth idea, here's an analogy. Imagine your router is a big pool, with a shallow end and a deep end. And, sure, there can be palm trees and an island bar. There are some kids who love the deep end and thrive there (they dive off the board, do cannon balls, etc). Then there are those folks who just love the shallow end (they sip their margaritas while the water laps at their legs, the kids can only go so far before their heads are under water, etc...)\n\nYour smart devices enjoy the pool, but with different needs. Some gaming devices and streaming devices need the bigger bandwidth (the deep end of the pool) because there's a LOT of information flying up and down the cable. They need more bandwidth to have more fun. Other devices, like floor care robots, smart plugs, etc.. don't need much. They like hanging out there they're at with their feet in the pool. Since they don't need much from the cable/internet other than a check in once in a while, they're content to sit in the shallow end. They only need the 2.4 band.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that some smart devices will ONLY operate on the 2.4 band. IF you reuse the SSID name (your network name) on the 5GHz band to make the transfer easy, your smart devices will fall off and you will need to activate/name/add password and reconnect those devices to the 2.4 wifi band. IF resetting those is too tedious, give them your old SSID and create a new one for the 5GHz band. As far as I can see, I cannot give my 2.4 and 5 GHz bands the same SSID. I can give them similar ID like NAME and NAME-1, but not the exact same name.\n\nAlso, GIVE YOUR NETWORKS A PASSWORD. If you just want to plug and play, take the time to 1: change the name on your router; 2. change the name of your networks; and 3. change the password on your networks to something uncommon and difficult to reproduce (not Password, Mine, Not Yours, LetMeIn, KnockKnock, your address, etc..) With so many smart devices comes many more vulnerabilities. If someone can get on your network through a smart plug or Crock Pot, they can fish around for your phone or laptops and find lovely dark web stuff. And, let's face it. If their Dark Web connected, they'll get in anyways. What you're doing is trying to foil the hacker-wannabe-idiot in the Honda CRX sitting outside your house looking for credit card passwords and account info (Save your passwords to a keychain or cloud recently and auto fill your info anyone?)  It's like a lock on your front door. It keeps the idiots out, but the real burglar with find their way in. Make it hard for the idiots.\n\nMy work here is done. :)",

                "review_body": "OPENING STATEMENT: This device replaced a \"TP-Link AC1200 Wi-Fi Range Extender, AV1200 Powerline Edition\" and an \"ASUS RT-AC88U\".\n\nDESIGN: Love the design and looks of the product. It looks great whenever you place it. It looks like decor or as a techy gadget if it is surrounded by electronics. Anyway, people do not recognize what it is. I have been asked if it is a speaker, an air purifier and even a lamp! The good thing is that it looks great whenever you place it. I really like that the power cord is slightly angled in the tip, which produces no stress on the conector. Well thought, Linksys!\n\nSETUP: Here is a big area for improvement. The setup relies on the color of a single led light on the top of the unit, which indicates the current status of the device. Well, I spent 40 minutes trying to setup this by myself because I was not able to see the light turning purple. I am colorblind, so having a product that its only way of providing feedback is by a single led that changes colors is a huge flaw on the design for me. Single led light is minimalistic and helps a lot with the physical design of the product, but instead of colors Linksys may use flashing patterns. For you, Earthlings, this may not be an issue at all, but for this cute colorblind Saturnian, it is very important. After having assistance from a friend who told me the colors of the led, I was able to setup the device in about 10 minutes. TIP!!!: If your ISP's modem is currently configured to work as a router and you are connecting the Velop directly to the modem, before physically connecting the Velop, disable the router feature, reboot your modem, and proceed after the modem has completed its loading cycle.\n\nGOOD: QoS works great! Companion app is good. Mostly used features are at your fingertips on the app and it is very intuitive. Good UI. The web interface is great as well, but not intuitive in terms of classification of stuff. Configurable!!! I love that this system has many configuration options available for the end user, other than simply enabling/disabling DHCP. For example, people tend to give high praises to Eero (the strongest mesh competitor out there today) due to how simple it is, but their price tag is way over the roof, and you never have control over the device. The Eero people control the system for you, constantly monitor it, they force configuration options/updates on you whenever they like, and you have no real options to configure as a router. For me, it is very important that I have all control over my network and I love my privacy. This is more important to me than having a plug and play experience. Why paying 30% more for a system that I cannot control and is constantly monitored? No way Jose! Velop offers the plug and play experience too, but I love/need the advanced configuration features.\n\nWEIRD: This is my first time working with a mesh system, so what you will read in this section may be the way that mesh works; any experts in the subject are welcome to comment... I found it weird that some of my devices connect to the mesh node that is farther away and not the one that is 5 feet away. Currently, I have 3 devices that are connected to the node that is 20-25 feet away, with 4 concrete walls, decor, furniture, tile, 2 wood doors, and small appliances between them and the node instead of using a node that is 4-6 feet away with no obstructions between the devices and the node. Why is this? Don't get me wrong, the devices never loose connection to the network, but I thought that the whole idea was to connect to the closest node or the one with better signal, at least. Anyway, since the connection never drops, I am not complaining. Another thing is that devices take a long time to switch between nodes. For example, my cellphone takes around 5 mins after I have placed it on a surface before it switches to the closest node. I expected the nodes to redirect in less than a minute. Then, while checking the companion app and the connection to some of my devices, I see that it reports that the connection to those devices is Good, but the devices themselves report Excellent connection. Weird!\n\nBAD: No love for 2.4GHz devices without some tweaking... None of my 2.4GHz-only smart home devices were able to connect to the Velop right away. Why? Well, the Velop combines both the 2.4 and 5GHz bands into a single SSID by default, and this was expected. But, what was not expected is that my devices were never able to identify the 2.4GHz band. Is the Velop \"broadcasting\" or showing as available the 5GHz band only? I do not know. To get my devices connected I had to separate the bands into two different SSIDs. As soon as I did that, they connected right away. TIP!!!: I gave the 2.4GHz band the original SSID name, and gave the 5GHz band another name. After all was setup and my 2.4GHz-only devices where connected, I switched back to a single SSID, and all my devices (2.4GHz-only and 5Ghz-capable ones) remained connected to their particular band. This is the single negative thing that I have to say about this product. I expected it to broadcast both bands as available, regardless of the single SSID. Maybe the issue is not the Velop and the culprit is the setup process of my devices, which may be looking for a 2.4GHz connection on my phone instead of looking at the actual broadcasted bands... But well, it is what it is.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Yes, I would buy this product again. Yes, I would recommend this product. Yes, I am happy with the product. Yes, I paid full price for the product; it was not a gift or discounted product. No, I did not receive anything in exchange for this review. Final note: I WISH AMAZON WOULD SEND ME STUFF TO REVIEW THEM!!!",

And no, I did not get a replacement - I sent it right back to Amazon for a refund and haven't looked back. If you are concerned with reliability in your home (or even office), Netgear Orbi is the ONLY way to go, not anything from Linksys - at least at the writing of this review (January 2019). I have tried 3 different setups (the EA9300 being one of them), and the Netgear Orbi (RBK22, to be exact) seems to be the most reliable, the easiest to set up and the coolest (actual operating temperature and aesthetics). If that's all you need to convince you to move on from purchasing outdated, poorly manufactured Linksys equipment, then read no further and continue on with your day. However, if you have already bought the EA9300 and are experiencing problems and cannot seem to understand what is going on, continue reading. If you have bought this router, and if you can, submit an RMA to Amazon right now - provided it's not too late to do so. Steer clear of Linksys. They need to revise their products BIG TIME. Notably, it doesn't matter where you buy this router - Amazon, Walmart, \"Retailer X\" - this router is bad news and nothing more.\n\n** Install: Is very similar to any Linksys Smart router setup - if you want to know how that is, look it up online. To do it right, you need to use the supplied patch to connect to PC or Mac to view in a browser, or if you're lucky, you can access it via wireless. Truly, the standard for setting up a router was set by both Linksys and Netgear - and the GUI for both are pretty straightforward. I will admit that the Linksys is more or less user friendly than Netgear - the menus in Linksys are quite aesthetic and easy on the eyes, but it is not easy to find things that you want if you don't know what to look for. I could say the same about Netgear, but the fact that it is more novel for me as the consumer (having recently switched over) is biased, so take that opinion with a grain of salt. I would say if you are uncomfortable with tech in general, you still have little to worry about - it is extremely easy to set this router up for use in the home. Even if you're new at it, the quick install guide in the box give very clear instructions. As a side note, if your ISP (internet service provider, ATT Uverse, etc.) does not allow their modem to be put into bridge mode (where the modem acts as a passthru to the router, which then manages the service), I would set your router up as an Access Point (AP). For tips on how to do this for your specific router, you can google it - in my experience in IT (CTO of a consulting company), 90% of problems with a router hooked into a modem stem from there being a conflict in the two pieces of hardware not working together. I've seen one network setup where the increase in speed was 400% (10 Mbps to 40 Mbps) just based on switching the router to act as an AP of the modem rather than an independent router (typically they default plug-n-play function). If you're in the market for a router because you're paying for internet and not getting it from your router (whether supplied by the ISP or not), check those settings. It can make or break a residential or office LAN (local area network).\n\n**Performance: I'm long winded, so bear with me. As I previously mentioned, setting this router up in my home was meant to replace my CISCO (Linksys) EA4500, which had died from heat and dust exposure...from obvious neglect. Being the hands on nutcase I am, I cracked the EA4500 case open and verified it was toast - the board showed severe signs of scorching, especially near the antennas. Typically (as many IT pros will attest to), the power source is usually the cause for equipment failure (which is why battery backups and ceramic surge protectors are used in high-dollar setups). Well in this case, the actual power brick for the EA4500 was toast - despite being on a reliable power center. I could have replaced the power brick, but knowing that there was scorching at the antennas, it didn't feel like a smart move on my part, especially since its technology is far outdated. Now, to the meat and potatoes of the EA9300:\n\nThe advantage of the EA9300, as advertised by Linksys, over the older style routers, like the EA4500, is that MU-MIMO (or Multi User, Multi input, Multi output) is the method in which signals are sent to devices. Simply put, if you are familiar with how to wire a set of light bulbs, you don't wire them in series (one right after another using a wire to connect each). You put them in parallel, so that resistance is not increasing across the circuit and your light bulb at the end of the chain isn't totally dim. Well, similar to the light bulb at the end of the chain, the older routers would place a device at the end of the signal cascade and therefore, it would have much less reservation on the bandwidth (whereas devices stuck higher up on the chain have most of it). The difference with these newer MU-MIMO router setups is that they put your device in equal with all devices, much like the light bulbs that run in parallel. Everyone gets the same slice of cake and they get to eat it all at the same time. Of course, there are some small issues with my analogy, but for all intents and purposes, this is the feel you get for reading Linksys's listing and box advertisements of the EA9300. You think you're getting this kind of performance for the price you pay the retailer. NOPE\n\nWell, the EA9300 may have a fancy processor to handle sending devices the same signal and it may have an extra 5GHz band, but they don't work out of the box. On two, COUNT EM TWO, occasions from TWO different retailers (Amazon and Walmart), this router performed EXACTLY the same in both setup, performance and longevity - about 17 hours from Amazon and 13 hours from Walmart). Now before Linksys hires a wise guy to take me out, I want to say that since power source from the wall and the PoE (power over ethernet) are the the only variables with me as the consumer trying to use their product, I voltage tested my power supply [on the off chance it was not stable]. I sat for an entire hour with my leads in the plugs (the approximate time it takes to fully set up a networking system in a residence under normal circumstances). I had no fluctuations in voltage, down to the 100th decimal. Readings were a steady 120.00 V. Regarding PoE, it's not supported by the Arris ATT Uverse modem. So just so we're clear - it's not anything I've done or my network setup. Furthermore, the Netgear Orbi RBK22 has been on for two days and it's not moved one hair off the maximum speeds provided by the ISP.\n\nSo here's what happens with the EA9300 when you take it out of the box. You plug the router in - setup seems fine. Speeds after setup are EXACTLY what you're paying for...and that lasts about 1 hour...then it starts...to...slow...down. The router becomes hotter and hotter (even with an auxiliary fan - not plugged into the router, but into AC power), reaching surface temperatures of about 43-48 C (which is hot to the touch). This continues until the 5 GHz bands start to drop in and out until you have a broadcasted SSID, but with which connection is not possible. But that's not all! While temperatures rise and connections are not possible, the 4 port switch on the back starts to emit an ozone smell, then a burnt rubber smell. After about 2 minutes of this, it gets really bad; the LED lights on the top of the router (White Linksys logo) starts to flash incessantly as if is trying to reboot or install a firmware update...or...wait a second, tell me that it's overheated?! So at this point, you disconnect it from Ethernet and power and wait until surface temperatures return to about 25 C (room temperature, which takes about an hour and a few minutes). Plug it back in after a cooldown and what do you know - it still doesn't work! Burnt rubber smell is now extremely present and while the light is no longer flashing, and while it is possible to connect to any of the three channels (2.4 or either 5GHz), you cannot stay connected and you cannot access the internet. After about 15 minutes - same LED flashing and same inability to connect to the broadcasted SSID's. I'll state again this EXACT thing happened with two different EA9300 routers from two different retailers on two separate days. Call it coincidence?\n\nSo...here's my hypothesis with this router and subsequently why you shouldn't buy it (as if the review thus far wasn't proof enough).\nThere is a high powered processor in this thing that is not getting enough cooling. Traditional routers' cooling solutions were always passive, because they weren't dealing out that much heat. They weren't doing that much and if they were, they were assigned a little 40 mm fan that just kept air flow moving. If you're familiar with network switches, traditional routers were no more than a 4 or 5 port managed switch with a 6th or 7th port dedicated to a 2.4 or 5 GHz wireless signal. Even in the days of just 802.11g, it just wasn't that complex.\n\nObviously, with ISP's pushing more speeds these days and the increasing number of wireless devices in the LAN, a demand has been made by the general consumer to get as much WiFi for as little possible. Well, one model to solve this problem is to beef up the internals of the traditional router to handle a much heavier workload - with the trick being to balance size and shape. Another model is to have an array of nodes scattered around an area to form a mesh that allows the signal [and work done by the network] to be commanded by the fastest path possible back to a central node (which there may be more than one of, by the way). The latter model has been implemented in the enterprise environment for years, but only recently has it been refined to accommodate higher bandwidths at the consumer market - where 4K video and other high bandwidth resources are required. I think the EA9300 would be a fine router if the system had an effective method of cooling, because when it worked, it worked. No doubt about it. I'm sure it's as simple as using an improved thermal paste on the heatsink for pennies on the dollar...or maybe even using thermal paste period. But the fact remains that Linksys struck out on the EA9300 and anyone who decides to buy it does so at their own risk.",

                "review_body": "WRT 3200ACM A very nice product, setup was very simple.\n\nOverall performance verses my 4 year old WD N900 router is much better; improved signal strength, improved throughput and so far no drop outs. I started getting drop outs on the old router when we exceeded 12 devices, the WRT has run flawlessly with up to 21 devices so far.\n\nThe unit runs quiet and cool \u2013 no fan needed, which is nice since fan noise can be quiet annoying.\n\nI manually configured the router (enter 192.168.1.1 into your browser) and used \u201cSmart Setup Tool\u201d to get connected to the internet and do a basic configuration, the setup tool makes this very easy. After that I manually edited a few parameters to \u201cpersonalize\u201d the network, simplify management and optimize performance as follows:\n\nChanged name of the 5GHz network rather than accept the default of \u201cName of 2.4Ghz\u201d appended with _5Ghz.\nEdited the guest network names and password and turned it off, I will switch it on if needed.\nRenamed some of the devices on the network map so that it is obvious which device is which. This make the network map much more useful.\nEdited the Host Name and Network Name, personal preference.\nTurned off the ability to manage this router wirelessly via Linksys Smart Wi-Fi (Connectivity \u2013 Administration tab) to reduce the chance of a wireless hack.\n\nWireless networking defaults were not optimal for our network so I made the following changes:\n\nSet the 2.4 GHz network to 802.11gn. This router does not support 801.11b so I don\u2019t think there is a difference between the mixed setting and the 802.11gn setting. I don\u2019t have any legacy b only devices so this is not a problem. Not supporting 802.11b avoids the 2.4 GHz radio having to do gymnastics to talk to any b devices this helps 2.4 GHz throughput and avoids the slight decrease in n or g throughput that results from a mixed (with b) setting. I thought about using n only but since g and n can play together (the overhead associated with sending a legacy preamble before the HT preamble is small and g devices can interpret the n preamble) I left g available. I left the channel width setting on auto and it selected 40 MHz i.e., twice the width and double the data rate of the legacy channels.\n\nSet the 5 GHz network to ac only to allow optimum 5 GHz performance, I left the channel width setting on auto and it selected 80 MHz  i.e., four times the width and four times the data rate of the legacy channels. I am not quite sure what they mean in the advertising info with regard to 160 MHz channel width since this device only has 4 antennas and 6 are needed to get 160 MHz bandwidth.\n\nI left the channel selection on auto for both networks.\n\nRestricting the router protocols has some potential disadvantages:\n1. Legacy devices that are restricted to 2.4 GHz b and/or 5 GHz a and n only will not be able to connect, so if you have older devices this might be a problem.\n2. If there are devices running 2.4 GHz b and 5 GHz a and n nearby they might interfere with your network and your network router might interfere with them. I am too far away from my neighbors for this to be a problem but if your neighbors are close you should probably use mixed mode.\n\nGiven that the 802.11g protocol was released in 2003 and that manufactures built 802.11g chipsets before 2003 I doubt that many people have many 802.11b devices only.\nI would like to know if there is a difference between the between the 2.4 GHz mixed setting and the 2.4 GHz 802.11gn setting. Does the router listen for 802.11b signals and back off to allow legacy transmission to a legacy router when 2.4 GHz mixed is selected? I called tech support but the person I spoke too did not seem to know what I was talking about.\n\nSome users have reported signal strength gains, I measured the signal strength (using a Wi-Fi Analyzer on my phone) before and after installing the new router (in the same location).\n\nOn the 2.4Ghz band the signal strength increased by an average of 3dB (double the power) running g and n protocols. This is not a huge improvement but will help in areas with marginal signal strength that are prone to signal drop outs. The increase in signal strength on 2.4Ghz varied from -1dB to 8dB, in looking at the results it looks like beam forming is working and increasing the signal strength in the areas with 2.4Ghz devices with up to an 8dB increase and an average of 4.5dB.\n\nOn the 5 GHz band the signal strength increased by an average of 16dB (40 times the power) running mixed mode. This made some previously unreachable (for 5G Hz) areas of the house usable for Wi-Fi and is a great gain in signal strength. The 5 GHz radio designs have probably got a lot better in the last few years and this result alone is a good reason to buy this router. The increase in signal strength varied from 11dB to 20dB and did not seem to be affected by beam forming (possibly due to the fact that phone that I used to take the measurements was on the 5 GHz Wi-Fi network when I took the measurements).\n\nIt is a good idea to back up your router configuration (Troubleshooting \u2013 Diagnostics tab) to allow a quick restore in the event you have to reset your router.\n\nThe Troubleshooting Status report pages are very nice to have.\n\nIt would be nice if you could search the router help information embedded on the router. The user guide does not cover as much as the help information on the router and he use of screen shots in the manual limit your ability to search (e.g., you cannot find Backup or Restore by searching the user manual).\n\nI am very happy with this product.",

                "review_body": "I use two wireless routers to cover both levels of our home, with the cable modem feeding into the downstairs router and an in-wall Ethernet line running between it and the upstairs router. I set up the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz wireless networks to be the same (except channel) between the levels so we can roam freely without having to change networks on our client devices.\n\nI bought two of these EA6350 AC1200 routers to replace a pair of Linksys EA2500 routers (10/100 LAN dual band wireless) that I had used previously.The previous ones had replaced a pair of higher-end Asus RT-N56U routers (Gigabit LAN dual band wireless) that both had hardware problems unresolved by Asus despite returns. I leaned toward another Linksys product because the EA2500 routers had been completely stable and reliable for a couple of years now, and my old WRT-56G routers before that had been incredible workhorses. I was only replacing the EA2500 routers because my ISP had upgraded my Internet speed to 105 Mbps download and the EA2500 routers couldn't give me the full potential of that connection. I tested this by pulling out my two gigabit Asus routers and seeing a dramatic increase in both wired and wireless performance when moving to the higher-end routers. Unfortunately, they lasted less than a week before failing again, so I was back in the router market.\n\nI considered the latest Linksys AC1900 router, but it had terrible reviews. I considered the latest Asus AC1900 router, but it is quite expensive, and I saw some inkling of reviewers describing the condition that my older Asus routers had suffered from. That spooked me. I chose this model because the price was decent, and the rated speeds should have easily been sufficient to fully exploit my new Internet speeds. Unfortunately, it did not turn out that way. This product performed quite poorly in my speed tests and I am returning both. (Still unsure which model I will replace them with.)\n\nMy initial impression of this product was quite positive. It is a nice-looking box and it feels quite solid. One minor improvement over the EA2500 that I appreciated was that the light that flashes while it's starting up has been moved from a tiny LED on the back to a large one on the front. When you're waiting for it to start up, before starting your connected devices, it's nice not to have to crane your head around for a couple of minutes to see when it's ready.\n\nI also appreciated the new initial configuration system that allows you to set up the router via wireless. That allowed me to use a Surface Pro computer to set this up without initially disturbing my existing network. One problem is that they are so sure that you will run through their guided setup that they put a big roadblock in the way of anyone who knows what settings they want and just wants to go to manual setup. There is a link that says click here to go to manual setup, and it does take you there, but a few steps into the process is asks for the router password. Next to it, there is a message saying this is the password you chose in guided setup. Well, yeah, unless you didn't go through guided setup. Nothing on the modem, or in the printed documentation said what the default password is. Luckily, it wasn't too hard to guess. I tried leaving it empty, then 'password', then 'admin' and the last one worked. After that, all the setup options worked well and it was easy to set up the modem the way I wanted it. Other than that one password issue, I would call the setup very smooth, but I recommend that you just go through the guided setup, even if you want to do it manually, then go in manually after that.\n\nI've read a lot of complaints about Linksys asking you to make an online account to use access your network settings remotely. I went ahead and did that (I don't really see the big deal... a zillion other companies have my email address). I liked that system. The iPad app worked very nicely, and I am sorry I won't have the option of using that.\n\nSo, one might think that I was very happy at this point, and I was. Setting up the router went well (I only set up the downstairs one... the one that plugs directly into the modem), the wireless signals were strong, and everything connected nicely to the new network. The next step for me was to run the new network through speedtests. I used the well-known Ookla Speedtest web site (on my Windows PC) and their iOS app on my iPad Air. Unfortunately, this turns out to be a dog of a router when it comes to speed.\n\nWith all respect to the reviewers who have called this fast, I did not have that experience. Of course I have no idea why others seem to perceive this as fast, but I wonder whether some reviewers were giving general impressions after upgrading from much slower products. Perhaps some simply had an Internet connection that is not fast enough to push a router to its limits and so the performance completely met the potential of the connection to their ISP. Perhaps I would have thought it was fast if I hadn't had the Asus router to compare it to. At any rate, I was disappointed and am returning the products. For those who don't want to delve into the numbers, you can stop here. That's the gist of it. For those who do, I'll follow with the details.\n\nThe test equipment I used is as follows. The ISP is Comcast and the cable modem is a Technicolor Gateway (first series) set to bridge mode (meaning its internal router and wireless network are turned off, so it only acts as a modem). The gateway runs via Ethernet cable to the router (one of three in these tests: this gigabit EA6350, the 10/100 EA2500, and the gigabit Asus RT-N56U). The router runs an Ethernet wire to my Dell XPS 420 Windows 7 PC (gigabit as well), to the upstairs router (an EA2500 for all these tests... none of the tests involved it), to a NAS device and to a Vonage box. All routers were hooked up in the same way, with the same equipment.\n\nEach router was set up with two wireless networks, with nearly identical settings (differences noted in text). There was a 2.4 GHz network set up on channel 1 with a 40 MHz bandwidth (except for the EA6250, which was set to an 80 MHz bandwidth). My home is rural and no other wireless networks are in range. The upstairs modem is set to use a 20 MHz channel 11, so there is no overlap. There was a 5 GHz network set up with auto for bandwith and channels (because 5 GHz channels are non-overlapping and dynamically adjust to conditions). Each router was set up with the same LAN settings, a static IP of 192.168.1.1 and the same static DNS settings. The router handles internal DHCP. No two routers were turned on at the same time. For each LAN test, I restarted the Gateway, then turned on the router, then started up the PC. For each wireless test, I also turned off wifi on my iPad, then turned it back on. I ran the Ookla Speedtest for each, specifying the same nearby Comcast server that Ookla tends to choose for me anyway. I ran each test three times. I thought about averaging the results, but all three tests for a particular setup, were so close (< 1Mbps difference) that I just noted the highest of the three. I am not going to report the upload speeds because my limit is 10 Mbps and all combinations uploaded at around 11 Mbps. No story there. Here are the download results.\n\nWired Performance (the Windows 7 PC only)\n\nDirectly connected to the Gateway: 121.17 Mbps\nAsus RT-56U: 120.41 Mbps\nEA6350: 91.64 Mbps\nEA2500: 81.32 Mbps\n\nAs you can see, the Asus router extracts a very small overhead, but this router (EA 6350) costs me close to 30 Mbps of download speed. The EA 2500 is slower still, but its theoretical maximum speed (100 Mbps) is slower than my Internet connection (105 Mbps), so one would expect that it cannot actually move data at 100 Mbps. Also, some may note that I actually get a faster speed than I am rated for. I can only assume that is because I am on a lightly-used segment of the network with some fairly new Comcast backend equipment. I don't really know the details, but the 120 Mbps is consistent out of the gateway. Now I know that some folks on much slower speeds might wonder why I am complaining about 91 Mbps, but I pay for 105 Mbps and Comcast is actually delivering >105 Mbps (how often do you hear that?), so I want my network to meet its potential. I do photo and video editing, and back up to the cloud. When I move large files around, I don't want to lose 30 Mbps of potential speed.\n\nWireless Performance (iPad Air only)\n\n5 Ghz Network\n\nAsus RT-N56U: 120.84 Mbps\nEA6350: 88.41 Mbps\nEA2500: 28.22 Mbps\n\n2.4 GHz Network\n\nAsus RT-N56U: 33.54 Mbps\nEA6350: 26.46 Mbps\nEA2500: 25.39 Mbps\n\nI am not particularly concerned with the 2.4 GHz performance, though the Asus still performs significantly better, but I am quite concerned with the 5 GHz performance. You can see that the Asus once again gives me very nearly all the speed the connection is capable of, but the EA6350 extracts a large performance hit. Could I live with the EA6350? Sure, but why pay over $300 for two brand new routers that are not going to meet the potential of my existing network? I'd rather pay a little more and meet that potential, plus leave room for future growth. Then, in a few years, when speeds go up again, I may not have to buy new routers again. Of course, if the stupid Asus routers could run for a reasonable length of time without having to be constantly restarted (see my review of those for details), then I wouldn't have to buy any routers at all now, but they will simply not run reliably so I am back in the market.\n\nAnyway, there it is. Take it for what it's worth to you. If you are on a 25 Mbps download from your ISP, none of this probably means anything for your performance. I imagine this router is more than capable of meeting those needs. But if you are on a faster connection, or expect to be in the near future, I would spend the extra to get some better performance.",

                "review_body": "This is my update one month later updating my review from 2 stars to 5 stars\nMy original unit was defective so said Linksys. Although I had to pay to send my unit back to Indiana , They sent me a brand new unit. My original one was a Factory Refurb.\nMy wireless network consists of my WRT1900AC in my home and as of today a Linksys EA6200 set to Bridge mode. It was a little tricky setting the EA6200 to bridge as both products are or were setup with the Linksys smart wifi online. The instructions said plug my 6200 from the yello jack in the EA to a LAN jack in the 1900 (but it didnt know both my routers were Linksys. I disconnected my 1900, and connected my EA6200 back up as if I were going to use it as my main router. Then I logged in. Important to do this in order or you will have to reset the 6200 to factory and start over. The first time I went to connectivity and edit IPv4 type of connection and selected Bridged. That was it. I was locked out. I reseted the 6200 by pushing the red button on back. This time I went to wireless, set each the 2.4ghs to miy network name. The same as I will use in the 1900. Did the same with the 5ghz plus added _5ghz. Then go to connectivity and edit and change type of connection to Bridged. Locked out again but this time I re-hooked up my WRT1900AC as my main router. Making sure the WIFI settings would be identical as the 6200. Reason I was told is for example as I go from one zone to the second zone with my iPhone it seamlessly switches to the stronger signal. When I first tried doing this with 2 older routers a year ago I had 2 different SSIDs and I ended up manually switching often. Now its working perfectly. No dropped connections, my LAN is working better as well. All in all I know I have just hit the tip of the iceberg with what this router can do. I am very green with all the things it can do But this router I believe was set up to also use custom Firmware. OPEN WRT. Im chicken to try it for now my wifi is working better and farther then I have ever had.\n\nLinksys thanks for replacing my unit no questions asked. Im now a fan again.\nBelow ist review of product Above one month later\nI wanted to upgrade from Wireless N to AC. I first bought a TP-Link wireless router. It worked ok but I started reading different reviews about AC wireless routers. I purchased a Linksys 900 wireless AC and had some issues with my wireless. It seemed ok but then mainly with my iPad Air 2 and my iPhone 6 plus it would drop the wireless connection as if it was sleeping . I have a wireless access point in my shop. A second wood building about 400 feet from my home. When I lost the AC wireless my phone or iPad would cycle to pick up the older N band! Finally I read the reviews about the WRT 1900 and was sold. I spent more than double what I spent in the past. I'm having the same trouble only worse ! I was watching a movie from my bathroom on iPad air2 streaming Amazon instant video. All of a sudden I kept losing wireless. I grabbed my iphone and made sure the iPhone was on the 5ghz band same as the iPad. I had already cycled the iPad off and on again hoping that would straighten it out ( I shouldn't have to do any of that according to reviews) it made no difference. I opened the same app with my iPhone and it worked. I could continue watching no problem. So I closed the app but kept the iPhone connected to the 5ghz band . Kept it near the iPad. Opened the Amazon app with the iPad and was able to watch the movie.?after 5 minutes I turned the WIFI off on my iPhone . Closed the amazon app on iPad and reopened it. It played the movie about 10 seconds and then dropped the movie. I tried it again doing the same thing with my iPhone watching the movie with the iPhone then the iPad and the iPad was again stable!  What's up with that? It's not the iPad because I took the iPad over to the shop where it automatically connects with my older wireless N and it streamed the movie fine! Another thing that this router does is a couple times a day that same internet mentioned above turns orange for a few seconds then back to its blue color. When that happens what ever I'm doing on the internet freezes. Finally if I bring any computer awake from sleep or even my iPad or iPhone it takes forever to reconnect to the Internet.\nI have about 10 days left with my Amazon 30 day return policy . I am very disappointed and considering returning it if I don't get answers . Then I'll purchase the nighthawk .\n\nI hope this can be worked out. Per the reviews I considered buying a second one since this reviewer said with the addition of a second unit as a wireless bridge he said it was the best fastest wireless network he's ever reviewed. That would be great if only it were stable. I'm going to give it 2 stars for now because when it is working it's great . Unfortunately it's very unreliable right now.",

                "review_body": "Update 6-22-2014\nMy kids 2006 17\" iMac OS X 10.6.8 AGAIN, could not connect to this router. Restart the router and then the iMac.\nTHIS IS UNACCEPTABLE\nI called their support 2 days ago about the problem with it crapping out at 16GB on eSata on a hard drive plugged into the esata port.\nThe person could not understand me. WTF? Now with this with a iMac that can connect to my old DLINK DIR-655 A1/A2 300Mbps 2.4Ghz with NO PROBLEMS can not connect to this \"top of the line, best of the best Linksys router\"?\nI wanted to smash the thing on the floor but then I'll be stuck with the $249 charge on my card.\nI put my old DLINK DIR-655 back in, it is NOT dual band,it just WORKS.\nThe iMac could hook up right away.\nSo I was about to order the Netgear Blackhawk R7000 BUT after reading the posts on yelp about Netgear customer service and it ends after 90 days and then they want you to pay about $120 for another year of \"phone\" support, I am skirmish about getting into something that may crap out after a few months. The Assurant or Asurion insurance kinda makes it better but some people seem to have been treated bad by their telephone support people (but at least they are in the United States)\nLooking at the UBI Edge router Lite and a wireless AP\nMore command line interface and not a real graphical, easy to setup router (only) BUT from what I read, once you set it up, it never has to be messed with again. People say 7 months, no reboots. I need something that works, too bad this \"beast\" of a router DOES NOT WORK.\n\nUpdate 6-19-2014\nI tested the hard drive. There are no problems with it. The S.M.A.R.T. is all green. I then hooked up a Thermaltake BlacX eSATA USB Docking Station, connected it eSata, put a 7200 RPM 500GB drive formatted in MS-DOS FAT. In Finder/OS X 10.7.5, after connecting to server 192.168.0.1 (router) it shows 499.98GB free. On the router GUI it only say 465GB free. 30GB in OVERHEAD? And I tested that 3.5\" HD before and the S.M.A.R.T. are all green.\nAnyway, at about 16GB transferred to it, on a 1Gb wired connection, it came back with \"Disk is FULL\"\nThis and like I said, the GUI web interface is for a dyslexic blind person, limited in what can be done (I mean after all, if someone spends $250 on it then it's a good chance they KNOW what they are buying but Linksys STILL made the interface for someone who is retired, in their 70's and never had a computer before. It needs to be more for the \"semi pro consumer\" who knows how to do home networking (or someone who has used a computer for more 2 years or can at least google it and get a answer).\nYou tube video\nyoutu.be/iNHLfp2UUKI\nTried to upload it on here, will try again later. Screen capture file is 6GB in HD. I hate re-encoding videos...\n\nUPDATE 6-18-2014\nTrying again to put 78GB to Intek on USB3 and have a Sandisk 16GB flash drive plugged into USB2 copying 14GB at the same time. REALLY making it slow in time, as in like 1 hour for each to complete.\nIt just stopped and said,\"Disk is FULL\"\nGoing to do a hardware test on disk to be sure BUT I doubt it, so this router kinda fails right now as having anything on USB as a network share.\n\nAnd that and other things makes it to where I probably will return it.\n\nGot it 6/11/2014 and today is 6/17/2014.\n\nI have 31, yes 31 devices that connect (at some point, not all on at the same time) either wired or wireless. The specs say this can handle it.\n1 27\" iMac 2011 wired\n1 20.5\" iMac 2010 wired\n1 Kodak AIO wired\n1 QNAP TS-419+ wired (both net jacks but on fail over) <<--4 TERABYTES IN RAID 10 config with about 3 TERABYTES FULL\n1 Dlink DNS-323 NAS wired <<--1 TERABYTE RAID 1 config\n1 Ooma wired (BEST HOME PHONE SYSTEM......DITCH AT&T or CRAPCAST and get one...the black list to stop annoying calls/unlisted/800 numbers is unlimited and community based)\n1 Dlink DCS-930L camera wired\n1 Sharp tv wired\n1 Sony blu ray wired\nChromcast\nWii\n1 TeleHD TV camera wired\n4 cell phones\n4 tablets\n2 old cells on wi-fi only\n1 Mac Mini wireless\n1 Apple TV 2 wireless\n1 Vizio tv wireless\n3 Dlink DCS-930L camera wireless\n1 Macbook 13\" 2006 white wireless\n1 Macbook Pro 15\" 2011 wireless\n1 iMac 17\" 2006 white wireless\n1 RCA streaming media box wireless\nand not including if I have anyone over and they need a connection.\n\nProblems.\n\nLatest firmware 1.1.7.160582\nI still had to reboot the device because items that showed up when they were on as I set this up, after the devices were turned of and \"supposedly\" releasing their ip they still showed up in the network map and after I turned things on they still could not connect.\nSo, REBOOT\n\nI have items on wireless that show up as wired.\n\nCan not put a name and assign a ip to a MAC like I could with my old Dlink DIR-655 A1/A2 that lasted 7 YEARS and would need a reboot like once every 2-3 months. And it had 25+ devices connected (or could connect) to it. I could give names to MAC addresses and assign the IP address, so the DHCP was very rarely giving out IP's. Things like the QNAP, needed to assign IP 192.168.0.70 and Dlink DNS-323 to 192.168.0.32 (because that's the IP on the firmware on it), but with this WRT1900AC I can NOT assign the MAC a name. I have to hunt and peck to find somewhere to run a report to see what is assigned a IP by the MAC, where on the Dlink it all showed up right there on the same page.\n\nThat is a FAIL on this router. The menu system is laid out for a dyslexic blind person.....ok\n\nI have 4 Dlink DCS-930 cameras, I want to give them IP's like 192.168.0.50/55/60/65 and assign NAMES to the MAC's so I know which camera I am looking at. Can't get it right on this new router.\n\nI setup a online access with this linksys but deleted the account after coming to realize that that leaves a entrance into my internal lan. It's not a VPN, it's just a https login. NOT real fond of others having my password to where it could (in a worst case) get hacked and then have some hackers from Russia or China putting stuff on my NAS's.\n\nI called SUPPORT. Tried any and all numbers TRYING to get someone who\n\n1:English it their FIRST LANGUAGE\n2:Live on the same continent as I do\n\nBUT any and all Linksys telephone numbers go to the Philippines.\n\nEven thou we are \"supposed\" to have our own special support people who deal with just the WRT1900AC, if anything you ask them is NOT on a script they read from they don't know.\nAnd I asked REPEATEDLY to talk to someone who is here in the US, not happening. They don't know of any telephone numbers IN the US.{on a tangent but-->That was a problem with Dell computers back in the mid 90's. I was a Dell Lead Field Engineer and when they switched to call centers in Asia, I, a FE for them, had to go thru that first before speaking to a level 2 tech who was here in the US. That was back then, things should be different now but they are not}\n\nUSB3/eSATA -- FAIL\nI put a Intek case (2.5\" USB3) with a 500GB Hybrid (4GB SSD/500GB platter) Maxtor 7200 RPM drive on both the USB2 first and then the eSata/USB3 connection to use as a simple network share for my iMac's and tablets and phones to be able to pull from. Apple TV to stream movies from it (once recompiled in Apple TV format).\nWELL.......\nI wanted to copy 80GB from my desktop to the drive. I wanted to do this so I could NOT have to have my QNAP or Dlink NAS on.\nThe Intek is powered by the USB connection.\nI know this drive works, upgrade the firmware from Seagate on it and it was in my Macbook Pro.\nIf I hook it to my iMac on the powered USB2 hub I have on the desk, I can transfer 100GB to it and never get a error.....so that takes time BUT it works.\nWell being plugged into the back of the router after about 3-4GB are transferred to it (either USB2 or faster USB3) the router kicks it back as saying the drive \"IS FULL\"\nI dismount it from the router, plug it in my iMac, select and move the same folders again (and it's on USB2 still but...) it moves just fine. I get NO ERRORS saying the drive is full.\nSo, the USB ports on the router or the router processing itself, stops the transfer of anything over a few 100 MB's at a time.\n\nSO THAT IS A FAIL for this \"beast\" of a router....\n\nSo I am NOT real pleased with the \"support\" for this router.\n\nThat and after reading and reading because I would want Tomato firmware on the device, there is not any. All has to do with Marvell antenna drivers and that is not a Broadcomm chipset.\n\nSo \"open source\" again, is just bull*s***.\n\nI returned a ASUS RT-N66U router to Tiger Direct (because for one they are here in Miami and that's where they started from) but it was because it just could not handle too much all at once (wireless) and the firmware sucked. And it's USB connection was a FAIL just like this on the WRT1900AC.\n\nI ordered this from Amazon.......THEN it hit me.........WHY AM I BEING CHARGED TAX? I understand when I go to a store in person but I very rarely over the years had ever been charged by Amazon. Then I read they charge tax to people in Florida now. Well I am NOT getting any breaks on the price (because it sells for $249 + TAX right here 10 miles away from me and to return it would be to walk back in the store).\nSo that's another pissy thing with Amazon BUT back to the router...........\n\nI just don't feel like this thing is \"the beast\" it was made out to be.\n\nWhen I am away my wife just wants to turn on her computer and compute.....NOT have to think about rebooting the router to get online. She is not a technical troubleshooting type person.\nWhile this router \"appears\" to be able to do great things, the lack of 3rd party software/firmware for it puts it in a \"do not BUY\" category.\nI am sure others have had \"great\" success with using this router but I have not, to the easiness of a simple, informative GUI and looking at whether the open source people are pursuing it to make better software/firmware.\n\nThis will be a RETURN in the next few days AFTER I go down the street and but a new router at the same price+tax as I would have to pay to Amazon. Maybe even get it on SALE in the store...Tiger Direct/CompUSA or BestBuy. They will match the price and charge me tax, just like Amazon.\nI have over the years bought a LOT of things from Amazon, high price things (>$500) and never thought about it because I was not having to pay tax, so I was saving money. I never pay tax on things from eBay. BUT now having to pay tax, and the same things sell for the same price (most everyday things) right here. I am going to have to start back with going window shopping again.......instead of seeing on the screen.\n\nI DO NOT recommend buying this high priced router that, for right now, is just a basic router with 2.4/5Ghz dual band and 3x3 MIMO.\nThere will be 4x4 MIMO routers coming out with thought put over the AC rates BUT, and this is the thing people just do NOT understand they just see big numbers but really have no idea of how things operate, that it does NOT matter that you have 10Gbit thought put on wireless to your iPad, it's still NOT going to give it to you because your connection to the net is still slower, and a chain is only as strong as it's weakest link.\n\nSave you money, look for something in the $125-$175 range if you MUST be cutting edge, but don't buy this....not worth it if you want to do any \"creative\" networking you will be disappointed in the GUI web interface, the problems with moving any file/folder to the network share that is in excess of 16GB because that will fail too.\n\nAsus will be coming out with a RT-86AC (name? I forgot) that is/will be 4x4 MIMO radios with 4 antennas that actually do mean something.\nThe 4 antennas on this WRT-1900AC are for show. One side is 2.4Ghz and the other is 5Ghz. And \"beam forming\" is just testing the latency from say antenna 1 and antenna 3 and which ever one is less, that antenna is used so you \"theoretically\" are getting \"faster\" speeds by a FEW MICRONS OF A SECOND. The human eye can NOT tell the difference. Oh and Verizon will still lag your Netflix, regardless of how \"fast\" the wireless speed from a router to your TV is.......",

I took the stock ones off and got a set of 9dbi antenna's to replace them with. my neighbor that is about 90 feet up the street, can get a signal from me, and that is through 2 houses too. I am not saying a great signal, but a signal that connects is still a signal. that is with the new 9dbi antennas.. I did not check with the stock ones. It does not have annoying lights on the front, or really bright ones either, like a lot of devices seen to have these days. they lights that are on the front are easy to see, but also easy to ignore too.\n\nThe complaints that I do have with it is more in the software then on how good it works. These are some features that some other brands have had that this one does not. It requires a password, but no user name.. so that drops security to get into it in half right there. If you dont have to much to worry about, when it comes to people getting into the setup on yours, like if you have WEP or whatever security enabled, this will be less of an issue, but if you leave yours open, then this might be more of an issue.\n\nWhat I do is set mine up for mac filtering, add the mac addresses of the devises I want to be able to connect, and then select, only let the devices in the mac address list to be able to connect wireless. This is one place that I dont like the setup. Even though it is easy to get into it to add them, there is no place to distinguish one device from the next. So say for example, you have a cell phone, and loose the cell phone, or break it, and have to get another, you may want to remove the mac listing from the list.. but how do you do it if you dont remember which mac address was for that device? or say you have a child, and you want them to get off the net, and they dont listen, or try to sneak on when grounded. Well, if you knew which mac address was theirs, you could just click to disable that one device.. but not having and description box for each mac make it harder to keep track of what device is for what mac address.\n\nNext is there is no reboot. Granted, you really should not need to reboot it very often, but if for some reason you do want to, you have to manually pull the power plug to do it. I have had others that had a reboot feature in the software. There is no status up time on it either. If you wanted to see how long it has been on for some reason, you can not. This comes into play, say, it something starts glitching, and you want to see if the device and been rebooted, or rebooted itself for some reason, or... if you can see the up time, then you would know, but that is a small feature that is left out of the software. there is also no info about connections either. If someone has been connected to the router, there is no way to tell how much they have been on it, how much data they have downloaded, or anything else. the only thing that they have about any connection use, is they will tell you how much time left you have on your IP lease. which can tell you how long ago it was that you connected to the router. and there is the info on that page too, that tells what your computer name is. No other info is there for you to get any other info about you though. Like I said, very limited on information. My last router, i could tell how much a certain computer has used the internet, how much data was downloaded by them, and much more. this one just seems to lack all the details about things. Oh yea, and that DCHP info, about who has a lease on an IP address.. well that is under local network, not the wireless tab too.\n\nIn case you are wondering, there are times where I will leave my wireless open for neighbors that do not have internet. and when i do, as long as they dont abuse the privilege, I may leave it that way for a time. But, if I see that someone is constantly thrashing my network, it would be nice to know who is doing it. just by simply being able to see how much data they have used, I can tell who did it. There are other things too, so that is just one example. so yes, these features can come in handy too. Like I said, they just did not seem to think about putting in most features that are not needed features. I guess they consider those other features, a luxury.\n\nAll of the main, basic features are there though, like changing the speed that anyone can connect to it at, WEP, WPA, WPA2, etc security, the tons of little things that most people never touch, the ability of blocking both times, and services, or even URL's. Like I said, the basic stuff that most people dont use.\n\nyea, i know, this is only wireless G, but for me, that is more then enough. Right now, I only have 20 meg down, and when time warner upgrades their service in my area, My plan will go up to 100 meg down, but when it comes down to it, for basic use, unless you are doing high end gaming, or doing things like torrents wirelessly, you really dont need faster then a 54meg connection to the internet. so it is not really a big deal. Even things like streaming services like netflix, only uses something like 4 meg down at best. at least that is the best setting that I can get that is available to me. that means you could have 10 people streaming video's at the same time, and still have much room to spare. Like I said, most average people do not need more then 54 meg down.\n\nSetup was very easy, and you can do it, even from a factory hard reset, without any disks too. Just simply connect your computer to the router through an ethernet cord, go to your web browser, and type in the IP address of the router in the web browser, and make any changes. No need to use install software, so if you loose the install disk, it is not a big deal. There is descriptions for all the setting built right in, so no need to look things up, or look for manuals if you are trying to figure out what a setting does.. It is right there on the side. If it is not, then there is a \"more\" link that you can click that will open another web page for you to view that info in.\n\nAs for the antenna's, if you want to remove them, there is a plastic cap over the base of the antenna. Straighten the antenna for easier grip, then grab that plastic base, and just turn like you would a nut.. It will unscrew off, and if the antenna does not come off with it, then just unscrew the antenna too.\n\nOverall, this is a good router, and seems well made. i hope it lasts me for years to come too. I just wish that it had more info about things. So would I recommend it.. yes.. as long as its limitations do not bother you. so far, it has been a good reliable little router.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nUpdate.\n\nI have found a little more info about this that I did not realize. First, you always hear that wireless G is up to 54Mb speeds, but what they do not advertise is this. First, that 54 is both way communication. So that means, you max out at 27Mb up, and 27Mb down. On top of that, that 27 is total, not just info. Meaning, overhead, security info, etc, is included in that 27. It is not just data. So the data speed will be closer to around 21 Mb speeds. and that is on a good connection. This is more then fine for someone with a low internet speed, someone just surfing the net, etc. But if you get 50Mb down internet speeds, don't expect to get the full use of it on this router. Mine started glitching out, so I just upgraded to an N router as I also upgraded my internet speeds too. Just don't forget, if you do upgrade your modem in aspects of higher speeds, you will also need to make sure that you have a wireless N adapter in your device too, or it will not improve your speeds any.",

                "review_body": "Summary: A great router if you need one now, and are looking to futureproof your setup; and the Cloud services are optional (after the initial setup)\n\nMy previous router: DIR-655 for about 5 years.\n\nReview: My last router stopped working after many years of great service. I was in a pickle: do I buy an 'n' router, the standard created over 5 years ago (ancient by computer standards), or do I get the newer (and untested) 'AC' standard for more $$?\n\nWhat convinced me was the reviews for the EA4500 v2. My thinking was, if this thing is basically the EA4500 with support for the new wireless standard, then why not pay an extra 40$ for the increase in technology? I assumed it would not be faster since I was still using g/n, but as it turns out, this thing smokes my old router (see speeds below).\n\nThe big selling point that Linksys tries to push is the 'App' feature. I'll put it to you like this: have you ever wanted to check your home internet status while you were, say, on business in another country? Or did you ever think, 'geeze, i forgot to change the parental settings!' and wanted to up the porn filter at home from your office?\n\nYeah, me neither.\n\nRouters to me are like the cement foundation of your home: I appreciate they might be the most critical part of the house, but hopefully I'll never have to bother with them. A bad router (or cement job) is one that requires attention after the initial setup. Hopefully the first and last time I looked at my EA6500 router screen was a few days ago when i took it out of the box.\n\nBasically, the programs ('Apps') that are accessed via registering for their Cloud service (free) is an attempt to be more Macintosh, which the kids find trendy these days. Your ea6500 MUST connect to Linksys for the initial setup, but after that you can choose not to create a Cloud account, which is what I chose to do.\n\nBe warned that as a Comcast customer, I had to update to the latest firmware for the router to work; something about hybrid IPv6 usage. That is RIDICULOUS, setting up a router should be easy. Although not technically difficult, it was still a pain and frustrating because I could have manually setup the connection myself if given the opportunity; sometimes these automated setups are more trouble. I imagine as time goes by, this will no longer be an issue as newest firmware ships. This is why I didn't subtract stars.\n\nGranted I've only had this for a couple of days, but there have been no dropped connections thus far. I usually wait longer to write reviews, but I wanted to let people know who are in my position: this is a great router.\n\nPros:\n+Very fast wireless transfer rates ('g'= 4.0mb/sec up from 1.9mb/sec, 'n'=14 mb/sec up from 7 mb/sec). Note that I lack dual channel clients.\n+Very fast wired tx rates (gigabit ethernet at around 75 mb/sec compared to the DIR-655 at around 30 mb/sec)\n+Excellent range (not a place in my 3 level townhome that I don't get signal)\n+Much smaller than the picture makes it look. Sleek design.\n+Linksys name to back up the product.\n+Great attention to detail: for example, you can disable the blinking lights on the router so my living room doesn't look like a discotheque. Cool!\n\nCons:\n-I had to update the firmware in order to setup the router: most complicated router setup since my 802.11a router!\n-Need internet access to Linksys to setup the router.\n-'AC' standard not widely available yet. I have no way of testing to check speeds, and Cnet and others have not yet reviewed this product.\n\nAnd the Apps are for me are neither negative nor positive; they are there if you want them.\n\nEDIT: 10/14/12 The router is still working great and have had no problems thus far. A friend reminded me that I forgot to include another frivolous feature: the 'Simple Tap' card. It allows you to add a compatible phone to your network without having to type in a password. Push a button on the router, swipe the card on your phone, and you're connected. Again, I don't think this feature offers any real convenience (what's so hard about typing in a password?), and you have to wonder, how much do all these silly features add to the price of the router? Still, you can disable all of these, and I'm sure someone somewhere will find the Simple Tap and Cloud features useful.\n\nEDIT:1/21/12 Still working with no problems. Because I'm accustomed to the DIR-655, I changed the location of the router page. It's now 192.168.0.1, and that was a breeze to do (I'm old and don't want to have to remember a new string of numbers). I did setup a new media server with a reserved IP with no issues, remote access is working well. The speed is still amazing (gigabit ethernet WAN as well). I have now mounted the router vertically behind a chest and it's completely hidden. I can only speak from my own experience (n=1), so take this statement with a grain of salt: this is the best router ever.\n\nEDIT:5/10/13 Still no issues or disconnects at any time. We have added a lot of wireless clients, 16 total (laptops, iphones, ipods, etc), and there are no connection problems. However, this new 802.11ac wireless standard has been slow to catch on and there are as of yet no decent 'ac' wireless adapters. So, buying this now is still an investment in the future. It's a bit frustrating, it's like having a helipad ready to go, and now I just need helicopters to come down in price. :) Technology moves quickly though, my DIR-655 was the same way with the then draft 'n', and now it's everywhere. There are rumors of the 2013 Apple computers supporting the wireless new standard, so we'll see.",

                "review_body": "The ease of setup of the Cisco-Linksys E3000 router astonished me! I had a studio and household FILLED with multiple PC's and Macs, both desktop and notebook computers, and a PC server plus Mac G5 server for my AppleTV Library, iTunes Library, and this router self-configured itself with each and every computer/device/system that I own, some 12 machines in total, in less than 7 minutes for the full cycle of the auto-connect feature to take place.\n\nThat FLOORED me totally, and I'm an advanced networking expert, who was prepared for a completely tough, manual install of this router but figured I'd give it a go with the Auto-Connect Feature of this router, by simply inserting the Cisco-Linksys CD ROM into my PC server's optical drive, and followed the prompts to the letter (to a point), let the router Auto-Configure each and every PC and Mac in my mixed-stable of computers here in my studio and throughout the house, 8 computers here in my studio near the router's plug-in to my Time-Warner RoadRunner HS Turbo Modem, and 4 other computers elsewhere in the house, and I'll be danged if the new E3000 didn't pull off the complete connection routing in less than 7 minutes actual time! CRAZY GOOD!\n\nI immediately fired up the router's web interface and went into the Advanced settings, and  renamed the System from default to my regular/normal System's name, set up the web interface for my network Hard Drive and plugged in a 1TB USB external HD for network sharing and backup services, reconfigured the password to my rather complex 26-digit and symbol password for ultimate security purposes, set the \"renew DHCP Lease\" to my own specific schedule apart from default, adjusted Media and FTP Server setting to active, and a lot of other \"host services\" to manual settings vs the default settings, and in less than 30 minutes total time I disconnected my former \"N-Spec\" router, and turned the duties over to the new E3000.\n\nSuffice to say it's been literally plug and play since then, with only a minor glitch to report, and that was perhaps my own fault but it involved updating the firmware to the latest and greatest, and my update went awry somewhat...I ended up having to re-apply the new patch TWICE before it took and set up correctly, and BAM!! All was well again, settings were intact, and when I restarted the System it fired right up, everything popped up green, blue, and yellow LED's like it's supposed to do, and voila! Firmware update a success, all was well, and the system @ 100%.\n\nThe Dual-Band aspect of this router gives it a special character, with the ability to transmit and receive signals and data simultaneously, at the same time literally, and maintain its incredible bandwidth in both the 2.4Ghz and 5.8Ghz channels without fault of any sort, and that's an amazing feature! My AppleTV system works significantly better than it did with the old MaxPower N-Spec Routerat full speed ahead, it being a single-band router and some 5 years old at the time I replaced it with the E3000.\n\nI find the web interface to be simple, and simplistic too, a nice interaction to work with when you want to customize any features, or change any settings manually vs the router's automatic setups. I have yet to have to restart or \"recycle\" this router after some 5 months of use thus far, which I consider to be very, very unusual given the nature of routers in general, but the Cisco-Linksys E3000 seems to be in a class by itself with respect to sustainability. It is also a router that you can place ANYWHERE with respect to its antennas being all internal (6 of them!), as I have placed it UNDER MY WORK STATION now, and there's no difference in the signal being all-pervasive and strong throughout my studio, and home to boot!\n\nI also use the router to handle the Administration of my twin RAID system's web interface, and that uses one of the Gigabit Ethernet Ports of the E3000 and plugs directly into the Areca 1680IX-8 Hardware RAID Controller, and that feature of the router has also worked without fail thus far, no issues at all! I have searched and tried to figure out S*O*M*E* weakness that this new E3000 router has, but alas there is nothing left to write or say with respect to things that are wrong with it, because the dang thing just works 100% for the good!\n\nEvery day that I use my system here in the studio and throughout my home I marvel at its consistency, it steadfastness, and its power, just incredible in all those aspects of use with my heavy, heavy needs placed upon it, and it's just fantastic. It would be hard to say \"it could be better\", because I just don't know HOW or WHAT we could do so as to make it better than it is right now.\n\nI am transmitting millions and millions of bytes of critical information up to Standford University in the Folding@Home program, with 5 active computers in the program here in my home and studio, and it's IMPORTANT that each and every byte gets transmitted up there for the benefit of mankind, and the critical research that the researchers are doing, and this great Cisco-Linksys E3000 keeps the candles \"lit\" in my contributions to the Folding@Home program hour by hour, day by day, and week by arduous week...it just doesn't fail me, and that is all I could ask of it!\n\nI never thought I'd say something like this about a router, but this thing is SO FAR AHEAD of everything else out there that you can buy for your home or office use for a high-speed data network, be it from a HD Cable Modem system like what I have with me here, a DSL system, whatever way you can critically look at such a thing as a router which literally is the lifeline between you and the internet, and all it can represent, but I'll say this for the record: I don't think that there's anything better being made today, AT ANY PRICE, ANY CONFIGURATION, ANY SETUP WHATSOEVER THAN THE CICSO-LINKSYS E3000 Router!\n\nThis thing is King of the Hill! I have actually purchased 4 of them since they were released in early June, 2010. The router that I bought this time went down to Australia to my business partner's home office to use there, because he cannot buy one in Australia at any price: they just aren't offered there yet, so I took it upon myself to score one for him and the network in his home office, and he is just like I am by now: a believer in this E3000 system 100% without qualification, without doubts, and without any negative thoughts whatsoever!\n\nIt's not every day that we have products this good come into our lives and uses, and this ladies and gentlemen is the best router that the good, old All-American $$$ can buy, bar none, no doubt as to that statement! The Cisco-Linksys E3000 Dual Band Router gets the Wavey Davey 100% Solid Gold and 5-Star Award for Quality, Value, and Performance, bar none! There isn't anything quite like it no matter what other brands you look at, or even other Cisco-Linksys models for that matter, it stands alone as the No.1 router of any type today, in November 2010.\n\nWavey Davey - November 14, 2010",

Made my first call to my internet provider on April 3rd.  Again on the 4th and again on the 13th.  By now I'm fed up and they had me bring the router in so they can test it, because they show no signs of anything wrong with their towers or connection.  I am informed that my router is fried and has probably been going out for a while now.  So I am back to using my old Linksys because it works and is reliable.  This fixed my lack of internet problem, but this doesn't fix the fact that I bought a product that only lasts just long enough to out last it's warranty.  Instead I am back to using my Linksys router I bought in 2010. I thought that this Netgear router would be better and faster.  I WAS WRONG!",

I've lost all ability to connect via the 8.1 OS.\n2) It will not recognize my registration so NO fixes nor upgrades\n3) Despite it being a secured network, I see new devices come on and off.  There is NO way to stop that, it's not an option.\n4) Drops my iPhone and iPad frequently even when it shows as full strength.\n5) There's more, but you get the point.  Netgear is a waste of money.  The 1st one failed after 3 months.  This one took a month.\n6) The genie changes device names at will and shows deviced not connected that are and vice versa.\nDon't waste your time and money.",

The 2.4GHz band on this refurb router does not work or drops so continuously that the AC1200 repeater that I bought would not stay connected.  I Tx'd this problem for several weeks because the 5GHz band was working fine and  I couldn't tell whether the refurb R6200 was bad or the AC1200 (new) was having probs with 2.4GHz.  Eventually I identified the problem to be the 2.4GHz signal coming from the refurb R6200.  It's sitting on my bench now and I need to confirm with Amazon that I cannot return it.  Being a refurb it does not have a regular warranty and since I took so long to identify what the issue was I am outside of the mini warranty that comes with this refurb'd unit.  Bummer for me but don't buy this for yourself.  You'd be better off with the TPLink 1700 AC router that I bought to replace this unit.  That thing rocks!",

On the 2.4ghz band everything worked great but on the 5ghz band I heard a noise emanating from the router if I downloaded or ran Netflix or anything that ran a lot of download speed and I couldn't run multiple devices at the same time on the 5ghz band with it lagging and I had a r6100 that ran far better. So all in all I don't recommend getting this router.

Full wireless signal everywhere in my house and blazing fast on the rare occasion I have an Ethernet cable hooked directly to my laptop.\n\nExperienced one or two very brief instances of dropped connection so far (3rd day with the router) but that could've been due to my ISP. I plan to update this review but I am very pleased up to this point.\n\nEdit: So those initial dropped connections that I originally experienced ended up turning into an almost hourly issue. I am changing my rating to 1 star due to the inability of the router to provide a consistent signal.\n\nFurthermore, refurbished Netgear products are only able to receive free e-mail support (no online chat or telephone). Before deciding to return the router to Amazon I tried contacting Netgear e-mail support and it took 5 days to get a response. Needless to say the router was already in the mail by the time the response came. I doubt Netgear could have done anything anyways since the unit was obviously defective.",

Hey Netgear, consumers don't want to make a career out of fixing your products.  We really don't want to hand over ridiculous amounts of money for the privilege, either!  WiFi routers should be like clock radios in that they should just sit in the corner, reassuring us with their lights that they are waiting silently and maintenance-free to do their jobs.

If it gets to 40 it is for a brief amount of time.\n\nI am incredibly disappointed that this router which I spent extra money on has been so abysmal in its performance.\n\nThe customer support policy for Netgear does not cover any length of time, and to get a hold of them costs even more money. I would recommend potential buyers to stay away from this product. I gave my ISP weekly calls for months when the problem was my brand new $130 router.

I bought this in January of 2014 and it had random reboots about 3 months in.  I would get a reboot every other evening.  I purchased this refurbished and so it was already past the warranty period (stupid me).  Well I decided to deal with it.  Then about 1 month ago, it went into a boot loop and I had to physically power cycle for it to stop.  So enter DD-WRT.  I install the new firmware so I could troubleshoot the problem better.  Come to find out, the seller actually sent me a \"refurbished\" unit that was not Version 2 of the router.  Even worse, someone had replaced the usb connector on the outside for a usb 3.0 connector so it looked like version 2.  Only after installing dd-wrt did I see that the processor was actually the V1 model (500Mhz instead of 800).  This led me to take apart the entire unit and check the parts.  The only thing that was \"upgraded\" was the USB 2.0 connector so it looked like a V2 router.\n\nLong story short, be careful when buying from a 3rd party....",

Can't impose time-based access controls by device, as you can with DD-WRT or other routers.\n\nWould like a little more flexibility on guest networks.  I'd like to allow guests to see others on the guest network for gaming and Internet access, but not our home network.  If you enable it so they can see each other, they can also see the home network.\n\nWhen it works, transfer rates are pretty good.",

Return it or don't buy it to begin with. Save yourselves the frustration, expense and loss of productivity. I thought it was a lemon issue or a quality control issue.

Our ISP talked us into the R6200 (without seeing the device in store) after contacting us that we needed to upgrade to a DOCSIS 3 modem, so I thought \"hmm, maybe I'll check Amazon for a better price.\" Result was an impulsive buy.\n\nWhen I opened the box is was immediately clear there was no wall mounting capability. So that was disappointing but my fault for not reading product description on mounting. Just sorta expected it to have that option since most routers and modems will have it. The lights on the router are totally unnecessary but they're nothing black electrical tape didn't fix.\n\nSpeed and range comparison of the 2.4GHz band to the WRT45G are kinda meh. QoS becomes an issue with wifi devices, which I thought the 5GHz band would fix (given our applicable devices). Problem is the 5GHz band doesn't have a suitable range unless you're almost standing on top of the router (exaggeration obviously).\n\nSo basically in all the upgrading I've done, I'm left with a sub-par performance (worse QoS) than my previous router and now takes up a spot on the ground that's annoying. I just don't see any positives aside from oh yeah it was how it should have been to set up...  probably should have gone for the N600. Still might.",

Hard rebooting causes the ReadyShare mounts to be forgotten about half the time.\n5. The media server will read folders that are locked by admin despite what the documentation says.\n6. If the media server has any problems with any files that it scans, it stops scanning and no errors or logs are produced. Good luck finding out which file is bad. Took a long time to figure this one out. Problem 5 made this even worse.",

Now i have spots in my apartment where I cannot connect to wifi.\nSecond, out of the blue it disconnects the devices attached. Almost everyday I need to reboot my Squeezebox in order to connect it. It never happened before with my 3500L.\nThird, forget about 5G wireless if you are not close enough to the router. The signal disappears after 25 feet or so.\nFourth, using a Netgear R6200 wireless adapter - the one recommended by Netgear, you get a few minutes of a fast connection and then it is all over from them there. The maximum speed I got was 54 Mbps and 150Mbps using 5G in a laptop few feet away. Using a $23.40 TP Link adapter the maximum speed I got was 150 Mbps.\nFifth, forget to hook up ethernet cables, it is impossible to attach them, they don't connect to the ports.\nIt is unbelievable R6200 works worse than a 3 times cheaper router. I thought I had bought a defective router, but reading the reviews here I see unfortunately it is only a matter of poor quality. I regret to not have considered the bad reviews before I bought it, it could save me money and time.",

They spent a good deal time trying to help me understand and improve the performance.  I'd give it 3.5 stars.\nOriginal: If you're looking for mediocre performance at a premium price, this is perfect for you.  5GHz performance is ok (390Mbps), but 2.4GHz is poor (65Mbps).  Router administration page is buggy.  Sometimes some pages just hang.  Range is just ok.  If this were selling for $30, I'd say it's fine for the price.  But for $100, it should be solid and much better performing.",

I called Netgear customer support for help, thankful that I have a one year warranty on the product.  They checked that it was not a hardware issue by determining the ip address of the router and having me \"ping\" it from my laptop.  That worked fine.  She then went on to tell me that it was a configuration issue, not a hardware issue, and as such, was not under warranty.  If I wanted their help getting my router to work again, I needed to pay $199 for a two year user support contract that would be good for all the devices in my house.  I told her no, thank you, and she came back and offered me a \"better\" deal of only $79 for one year which I also refused.  Then she said as a special one time offer they could give me 30 minutes of technical support for only $39, at which point I hung up.  It would have been better if she had given me all three options at once, without trying to sell me on the most expensive one first.  However, either way, it is disappointing that it was working fine last night and now I need to pay considerable $$ just to get it working again.  I have my laptotp directly plugged into my modem and that will do for now.  Anyone want to buy a used NETGEAR Wireless Router from me?  It may not connect to your modem, but who cares?

After reading other reviews about how great this router is and the wide range it provides, I decided to take a leap of faith and purchased it. I received it two days ago and so far for the price I have to be honest and say I'm quite disappointed.\n\nInstallation was fast with no problems, however, I noticed that wired connection to my desktop worked great but to my laptops, tablets, game consoles (2 Xbox 360's - 1 connected by wire and 1 by wireless) internet connection has been spotty at best. A few minutes the connection will work, the next I'm getting that there is no internet. I haven't played around with the settings because I didn't want to make it worse but so far I have my laptop two feet away from the router that's connected wirelessly and it's continuing to say there's no internet (even though signal strength is at 100%). I thought maybe it's the laptop so I connected the old router, wireless internet was working again.\n\nI'm not sure if it's a defective router, which sucks because I really need a new one and was hoping for the best with this, so I'm going to try and return this and get the NETGEAR r6300 and hope for better results.",

                "review_body": "This is one of the best routers I have ever had. I opted for comcast service for 50Mbps, and I chose to rent their router. The router they gave was 2 in 1 modem + wireless router. The wired speed was good (~50Mbps which was the actual speed I paid for) but for wireless I couldn't get anything over 4Mbps, even being next to the router. I called comcast and tried several things which the rep, which didn't help almost spent over 4hrs. One of my friend suggested me to buy this as a wireless router and I also brought a comcasr compatible modem. I connected the router and the speed is always been amazing. I get nearly 60Mbps on wired network and approx 57Mbps on wireless consistently. This is a huge improvement and I am happy that although this router being expensive it has rewarded me with good speed. I highly recommend this router if you have speed problems.",

I had rushed shipping on the device to get it in to replace my previous ISP-provided gateway device but the local delivery group happened to lag behind and the package arrived about three hours after I went to work.  When I came home that night my completely tech illiterate roommate had already opened the router, followed its simple instructions, and had the thing humming along with no need for manipulating any settings.  Every feature I have tried has gone off swimmingly and I am receiving 99% efficiency between my ISP provided speeds in every room of the house and even out in the yard.\n\nThe device works so well that my mother (who has some technical know how but had never setup a router on her own) used it and a single NETGEAR dual band extender to cover her nice sized yard, home, and has been raving about it ever since.

The Android app to manage the device was a bit lacking.  After about an hour, I gave up on it and exclusively use a full size computer when performing any maintenance.\n\nTwo complaints.  First, the first router died one night.  At first it would connect to my cable modem at 10Mb speeds (modem is rated for more than that).  After about 24 hours, the router refused to connect at all.  Internal network was unaffected, just could not reach the outside.  I purchased a replacement router (same model) and was back online.  Second, do not place this router near a speaker.  The speaker will pickup interference from the router, generating soft popping sounds.  Only notice it when there is no signal to the speakers but then, it is pretty obvious.",

It connects with your modem - wireless or otherwise - and is so easy to set up your devices.  It has a WPS button, which is a nice change from my FiOS router, too.  When I downloaded the NetGear genie it showed me the channels available and which channels my router was on.  My FiOS router was on channel one with 4-5 other routers.  No wonder is was always slow and dropping!  You can select which channel to use for your router or you can let it select it automatically.

My home network includes: One Samsung smart tv, a PS3, two laptops, two Samsung smart phones and a Samsung tablet.  Typically the phones, tv and PS3 are connected most. Over all when devices connect the connection is fast.  It has a lot of features that I will have to research more to get what I believe will be the best use of this device.  The tv connects better to this router than my old one, but I find my PS3 is rarely able to connect and when it does it loses it's connection frequently, which is a major let down, because we use the PS3 alot for video streaming.  I wish I could give the router a better score, but as of this review, it is barely performing better than the D-link router it replaced.  Will update review if I can modify the settings to get better overall performance.",

After 2 weeks, the 2.4Ghz stopped working.  Occasionally, after a hard reset, the 2.4 Ghz would give me 25Mbps compared to 145Mbps on the 5Ghz.  Other times, I couldn't get any internet access at all on the 2.4Ghz but still get well over 100Mbps on 5Ghz.  I overlooked this issue until I bought something that can (unknowing when I bought it)  only use the 2.4Ghz frequency.\n\nSo, I finally decide to contact Netgear Tech Support and went through various different steps with the rep to try and resolve the issue.  It didn't work.  The rep told me to call back the next day if it doesn't improve overnight.  I called the next day and got a different rep and went through different steps but it still didn't help.  They finally agreed to replace my router.\n\nI get the email with instructions for replacement and find out that I have to pay to ship my faulty product back to them and upon reception, they will send me another one.  Why do I have to pay to have a product that is defective from the manufacturer fixed?  Why must I be without internet until I get the replacement?

The router does not fit as nicely into my tech area because of its unique shape, but its not so bad.  Overall, I feel good about this purchase and it has been working well for a few months now.",

We bought this router because our last one was not putting out enough power/internet throughout the whole house- the master bedroom, the outside deck and the basement were sadly without the speed we wanted. This router has helped out with those problems, but I think we still need to get a relay or something for the basement to get the amount of juice needed to stream shows/movies on a regular basis.\n\nAs for looks, it is a bit bulky and since the wide part faces out, you are losing some space on a desk or wherever you place it. I like that I can see that it is powered up and the other necessary lights on the front.",

No CD required and hook it up to your modem and connect it to your computer. I started the installation from my cell phone. The reason for purchasing this router is to have better wifi connectivity within the entire household and to be able to play online games since the router that I previously had was good for ideal online gaming. I have a PS3 and Xbox 360 along with wifi capable computers, printers, smartphones and blu-ray players. All are connected and have excellent strength. I connected my PS3 and it works. However, when playing online, I get disconnected every time I would reconnect to the online servers. I changed the SSID channel and the same issue. Luckily, I had a NETGEAR WNCE2001 Universal WiFi Internet Adapter which fixed everything. It gave my PS3 the impression that it was pluged into the router eventhough it wasn't.  I am going to play around with the router a little more to see if I can play online without having to need the wifi adapter. If not, then I may just send it back and use my old router the Netgear N150 that came with my service provider.",

I may be a little bias on this review because previously I had the at&t provided router which would go out for a few minutes every hour so I am extremely over joyed with this product that doesn't do that.  also it raised my speeds up to over what AT&T say they should be.  If you need support, and have a hard time setting things up don't get a refurbished one.  But if you are a little saavy you can get a refurbished one and set it up no problem.  I love that there is an app for your phone, you can see what is using the router and kick people that are trying to steal or hack your router.  I recommend it.",

From pulling the different parts out of the box, hooking wires up to the computer and modem, to navigating on the computer once it was hooked up, this was a simple and smoothg process.\n  Once i had the router set up and connected, i was again surprised by how far i could get a wifi connection. I have a small rach, but the router is a closed wooden cabinet in my basement, but i am still able to get a connection either outside in the front by the street as well as in the backyard behind the garage (50 yards and 70 yards respectively). I found this same product in stores and online and it was anywhere from $30- $60 more expensive than Amazon. This was a great purchase. i definetly recommend this router.",

Don't plug your laptop directly into the modem or it will screw up the mac address mirroring.\n\nAfter I finally go the wifi working, I couldn't break past 10 mbps download speed.

I messed with the channel selection, the MTU size, tried to disable the 5ghz connection, tried sitting immediately next to the router.... still couldn't break past 10 mbps. I was about to ship it back when I decided to check for a firmware upgrade. The instruction manual said the router would auto-update when it had access to the internet, but that's incorrect. It must have been running the first version ever made, and after a manual firmware upgrade I was up and running with 30+ mbps.

I looked into range extenders but all the professional advice I found suggested that they create as many problems as they solve so I decided, in spite of cautions in various manuals, to hard-wire this as a second gateway linked to the Uverse gateway in a room closer to the kitchen.  It installed easily, works perfectly, and according to a Win8 speed test app, the speed through this router is actually faster than that reported through the AT&T installed Uverse RG.  (I don't know how that can be but that's what the data shows!)\n\nSo I now have two separate routers that cover our house and the surrounding property and I can always pick the one with the \"most bars.\"\n\nAs a side benefit I am also using it to provide a secure local cloud drive for backing up and sharing data between all our Windows PCs (3 of them), our Android tablets (2 of those), and all of the family cells phones (5 of those).  \"Installing\" the share drive on each device didn't work quite like the manual said but did turn out to be pretty simple once I figured out the correct IP and how to create a \"bookmark\" in File Manager HD.  (File Manager HD is a great Android App by the way.)",

Will be ordering something else to replace it.\nThis may work for most people and it has some really cool features and should work without issue for basic stuff like gaming/streaming however if you need speed you may need to look elsewhere.\n\nIn most cases this is more than capable of saturating your connection to your ISP and the below comments regarding speed won't effect you. I however like to have the option to fully saturate my local network.\n\nKey issues I have which most won't care about:\nNo third party DD-WRT or OpenWRT firmware support.\nNo IPV6 despite what some places online indicated.\n\nAfter testing, With a Wired connection its only hitting about 600mbps sporadically with a peak of 800mbps. This is between 2 desktops running Linux reading and writing to SSD drives so the network was the bottleneck. For kicks hooking them up through a separate gigabit switch results in full saturation without issue.\nWireless connection struggles with 1 active device. I don't have a AC device on hand to test those speeds however my laptop which has 802.11n capable card can barely hit 70 mbps. My phone which only has a b/g radio hits about 5/6mbps however using the original Comcast router my phone could almost fully saturate the connection.\n\nI would not recommend this to a friend either. As noted I don't have an AC capable device to test that, that may work just fine. If you need a device which is fast you are probably going to need to spend 200+ on a good router anyways.\n\n[Update]\nLess than 24 hours after setup, The router would occasionally freeze up and stop routing all traffic.\n\nMy",

I would have given 5 Stars anyway but after having it a few weeks my 5G band became unconnectable from any device i tried, & I had to reboot the router before that side it would work again. It has been quite some time since there has been a driver update.....1.0000.34 is the latest. Maybe this is the end of software development for this model.

As far as speed goes, this router does not disappoint! It certainly is made for larger households. I live in a third floor apartment and I still get three bars on street level!\n\nNo to explain the title, when I first activated this router I could walk downstairs and outside to an area not too far from my apartment where I take my dog. I won't bother estimating the distance as it's not necessary for this explanation. Anyway, for the first week or so, I could still get maybe one or two bars there and browse the internet on my phone through my WiFi. But as time went on, I could no longer receive a single bar there, and though the WiFi stays connected, it says that the connection is unstable and I cannot load anything.\n\nThat however, is the only issue I have had with the router and it's really not that big of a deal. I just thought I'd mention it for anyone that might be concerned. It could just have occured because I always forget to turn the router off even when I leave my apartment for days at a time. Otherwise it connects well with both of my PS3s, laptop, tablet, mine and my girlfriend's phones and to her WiFi HP printer!",

It continually lost internet connectivity. The router needed its power cycled off/on about once every ten days on average to reconnect. Also, DL/UL speed was erratic. (Subsequently, I\u2019ve learned of other Netgear router users with repeated episodes of lost connectivity resolved by cycling the power off/on.)\n\nOn day- 94 after purchase (December 24), Netgear worked with me to adjust the router\u2019s Advanced Settings. Ultimately, there was no charge for that, but the initial Netgear position was that the adjustments were outside the 90-day warranty and I needed to buy Premium Netgear Service.\n\nI wasn\u2019t charged, so you say, \u201cNo harm, no foul.\u201d Right? Wrong, because my second and third contacts with Netgear service (on January 11 and January 14, 2015, reinforced my belief that customer satisfaction is a VERY LOW PRIORITY goal for our friends at Netgear.\n\nOn January 11, I bought a Netgear cable modem (CM400). After I spent a total of about 3 hours on the phone with tech agents at my ISP and Netgear service, the Netgear tech agent determined the cable modem was defective. He told me to return the modem to Netgear for a replacement. He told me that for $30, Netgear would ship a replacement cable modem that I would receive on the second business day. I could then return the defective modem to Netgear. In the alternative, I could wait 3-5 business days for the replacement modem, and there would be no charge. It seems inherently wrong to me that I would have to PAY to return a defective modem that I bought 5 hours earlier! I don\u2019t understand that kind of a policy unless customer satisfaction has a very low priority.\n\nQuite by accident - the Netgear rep didn\u2019t volunteer the information - I learned that the replacement cable modem would be a remanufactured unit. Gasp! I buy a NEW modem at full retail, only to have the manufacturer replace it within 72 hours of purchase with a REMANUFACTURED unit. That would describe my situation if I had I accepted this Netgear-offered solution.\n\nFinally, on January 13, I contacted Netgear service once again concerning my September-bought router. This time I intended to seek help undoing the Advanced Setting adjustments that were put in effect with Netgear\u2019s counsel on December 24. The changes had not resolved the problem with erratic DL/UL speed, but my inquiry went nowhere. The issue wasn\u2019t covered in the FAQs that I could find, and the Netgear agent again wanted me to pay for premium service. Wrong, wrong, wrong.\n\nI won\u2019t buy Netgear again.",

The other 2 users (Adults) should be able to freely use the internet without restriction.\n\nSeems simple enough \u2013 not so much\u2026\n\nAttempted:\nParental Controls (OpenDNS) NetGear Settings -\nParental Controls does not block all internet websites \u2013 for example Google still comes up and the users can search web content which is bypassing the controls which was set to block all categories including search engines. Additionally, Parental Controls require those users bypassing the controls (the 2 Adults) to download additional software and have that software running when they are using the internet. This is not mentioned in the advertising for this product. The product advertising implies everything could be controlled as an administrator of the router, not have to install software on devices. It also doesn\u2019t mention that the OpenDNS software was needed to augment the NetGear router. A quick internet search produced armies of disappointed users complaining about the same lack of control for the Parental Controls settings.\nNetGear Settings -\nThe NetGear controls themselves work blocking all content, but it does so for all users. The settings made affect everyone on the wireless network \u2013 not some users. The exception to this would be by omitting \u201c1\u201d IP address. This does not meet the requirement. More than 1 user should be able to freely use the internet without restriction (meaning each Adult should be able to use their individual devices without restriction).\n\nConclusion:\nThis product falsely advertises the ability to block content from some users (Kids) while allowing other users (Adults) to freely use the network. At best it can block some content, but NOT all content. Had this feature worked as advertised, I could have looked past all the other \u201cissues\u201d I had with the router; set up complexity, additional downloads for bypass accounts, etc.  The product requires the \u201cbypass\u201d users (Adults) to download software if they want to freely use the network once the Parental Controls are turned on. The product advertising falsely states that the set up of these features are \u201ceasy\u201d. The set up is NOT easy if you want to put in controls. I have personally spent hours with the NetGear help desk trying to get these control settings to work. The NetGear support people themselves did not have the answers to how some of these settings worked which means you have to figure it out by internet searches.  People should not be required to have a computer science degree to accomplish setting up a router. They also should not have to spend hours surfing through blog postings.\n\nThe reason I purchased this unit was to accomplish the seemingly simple scenario I listed at the beginning. Had I known the router could not meet the requirement, I would not have purchased it.",

My router stopped working 3 weeks past the 90 day period and there's no way to get support, since they won't talk to you on the phone and I can't connect to their support site on the internet to troubleshoot the router since it doesn't work. So my choices are:\n\n1. Buy their \"contract\" and call their (foreign) support staff and see if the router can be fixed with some minor software tweak. or:\n2. Throw away this POS router and buy another brand that stands behind their products for the same price as their \"contract\", and chaulk it up to a $130 life lesson.\n\nIn summation, I'd review this product as follows:\nPros:\n\n1. It worked for 3 months and 3 weeks, although it never seemed to register the speeds it claimed even though we pay for the fasted internet available.\n\nCons:\n1. It ONLY worked for 3 months and 3 weeks.\n2. It never seemed to register the speeds it claimed even though we pay for the fasted internet available.\n3. HORRIBLE TECH SUPPORT!\n4. Netgear does not stand behind their products even though they claim a 1 year warranty.\n5. Try to hard sell you on their service \"contract\" (which costs just as much as the router) get any support past 90 days!\n6. Did I mention the HORRIBLE SUPPORT on this POS router??\n\nNow after my $130 life lesson, I only wish I could rate this router less than 1 star.\n\nEDIT: So Netgear responded to my bad review; they mention their free email support. I wonder how that would work: Day 1: I have to provide all my personal information to them, which I already did twice; once by phone and once by live chat (only to be told each time that that support is no longer available even though I have NINE MONTHS of warranty left on their product). Day 2: they email me to tell me to reset it; of course I already did that. Day 3: they email me to tell me to reset the modem; which of course I already did. Day 4: they tell me to run the Genie software and let them know what it says (which of course I did and it said the router wasn't connecting to the internet, even though the modem was working fine). Day 4: they tell me to reset the router to factory specs, which of course I already did. Day 5: etc, etc, etc. Netgear apparently doesn't care if you have no wireless internet for weeks and months; THEY ONLY WANT TO SELL YOU A SUPPORT CONTRACT THAT COSTS AS MUCH AS THE ROUTER!\n\nThank goodness for Amazon; this is why I do so much business with them. Soon Netgear, you'll have your bad router back and can scratch off the serial number and sell it to some unsuspecting person, who will have NO SUPPORT at all! I will never buy another Netgear product and have already replaced it with a much better Asus router with 2 YEARS of warranty and support!",

                "review_body": "I purchased this router in July with the hopes that I could take advantage of the USB connection, the gigabit ports and the advertised fast speeds. I had purchased this as a way to replace my old Netgear router which was a really solid device with terrific range, dual band and very easy to use. Unfortunately, this $129 model so far has been a nightmare. Terrible range, slow speeds, and constant dropped signals. At least 20-25 times a day the router would mysteriously drop the Wi-Fi signal and my devices would appear to lock up. I would at times just turn it on or off, power cycle and it would work for a few hours. Other times, it would just re-start on its own and again, it would be fine for a few hours. The netgear genie application is a nice tool, but Netgear should really deliver on its products, and quite frankly I'm not sure I could buy another Netgear product in the future. I even sent an email to tech support only to them to send me a link to make sure I've placed it in the right location. If they refuse to help or fix, I will sell it and buy a DLink or an ASUS router. I'm still hopeful, but not confident they will do the right thing.\n\nUpdate 11/25/2013\n\nAfter much back and forth with the Netgear folks, they made good on my Router and I received the replacement device R6200 v2 last week. I was worried at first as the router dropped again twice, albeit during set up, but since then I am happy to report that it's been trouble free with no drops or lag, and has actually been running consistently speedy. I will say that the device works ALOT better at 5G speeds rather then 2.4 GHz, and was completely compatible with my DOCSIS equipment. While the range is still not the best, its more than adequate to cover a 3000 square foot, multi level home, and with the aid of a Wireless Range Extender, the experience has been a pleasant one. The WPS function was easy enough to use and I am happy overall now that the product appears to work as advertised. Kudos to the Netgear folks for making it right, but I wish that it hadn't been as bumpy as it was to get it fixed and replaced. Either way, I am back in the satisfied column and would recommend the product.",

                "review_body": "I just installed this router last night to replace my 6 year old workhorse Linksys WRT54G after realizing all my devices are now beyond b/g wireless technology.\n\nThe setup was a breeze, anybody familiar with logging into the router through your web browser will have no issue. The menus are intuitive and the advanced tab is informative. I haven't taken advantage of the Netgear Geniue software, just not interested.\n\nSpeeds: Speeds across the board have increased. My connection has always had a wired download rate of approx 1MB/s. Now I'm seeing wired speeds of approx 2MB/s and wireless matching 2MB/s as well! My wired data rate is still roughly the same at approx 12MB/s between wired computers but my wireless data transfer between computers bumped from approx 2 MB/s to matching wired speeds at 12MB/s!! That is by far the great improvement so far.\n\nRange: I can't really provide a solid review for those interested in range. I live in a roughly 700 square foot 1 bedroom apartment and it doesn't take the most advanced router to give me complete coverage. My router is setup in my bedroom and all devices in my living room have full bars. This includes both spectrums, 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz. I also get full bars on my patio located outside my living room. So far for my average sized apartment, it's great.\n\nFirmware: I like the firmware, there was an update available right off the bat and it was a breeze to upgrade. The tabs and options are pretty thorough and covered all my needs easily. The router runs the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands at the same time and they use different SSIDs. I rather liked that as it tells you when you login on your device which spectrum you're logging into. It provides all the wireless security protocols and it's a easy to set that up as well. Some people are buying this for the guest network feature, I didn't but from what I can tell it doesn't give you much control over guests beyond wireless security and making it available, I did not see bandwidth controls etc. Other everything was intuitive and I appreciated the additional information in the advanced tab.\n\nThe Hardware itself: I really like the way this router looks. It's glassy black and doesn't have a dozen flashy lights keeping you up at night. It has a power on and off button in the rear and a WiFi on and off button on the side. The rear includes 4 ports for your wired items and 1 USB port for a printer or even a hard drive. I haven't taken advantage of that feature yet, but when I open windows explorer I do see it on my network list so I suppose its waiting for me. All in all it's a great looking piece of hardware that looks nice on your desk or tucked away in a cabinet.\n\nOverall: I'm very pleased with this purchase, easy setup, increased speeds across the board and when my devices start coming with AC wireless tech, I'll be ready. At the time of this posting all my devices are N, both 2.4Ghz & 5GHz capability. According to the packaging you get up to 300 + 867 Mbps speeds which equals roughly 145 MB/s. Obviously I'm not seeing those kinds of speeds so perhaps this router is over kill for me, but with all that said, I am very pleased with this purchase.",

                "review_body": "Purchased one of these on the Amazon Black Friday event for a spectacular savings.  Was really excited to replace my current Netgear 300 router, as it frequently became bogged down with all the devices connected.\n\nGreat price!  Super quick shipping!  Amazon ROCKS!  And thank God Amazon also has a terrific return policy!\n\nI spent over an hour with less than helpful Netgear tech support who did little more than recite a pre-written troubleshooting script in a language which they were not anywhere fluent.\n\nThis particular unit has something wrong with the 5ghz.  It's not broadcasting the 5ghz signal.  Maybe a bad antenna?  Who knows.  The tech support guy, and his supervisor, both told me it must've been the peripherals, it couldn't be the unit, because they followed the script, and everything checked out.  So, either I have a unit with a bad piece, or (less probable) I have 4 different 5ghz compatible devices that are all broken somehow.\n\nSo, I'm sending it back.\n\nPROS: REAL easy to set up.  2.4 ghz seems to work like a charm.  Fast, good distance.  Amazon is a great company to deal with.\n\nCONS: Horrible tech support from Netgear.  Spent 20 mins on hold, and over an hour talking to 2 techs, one of which was a supervisor/manager.  Their support website leaves a lot to be desired.  Googling the issue shows that, while it's not a common problem, there are enough units with the problem where there were many search results.",

                "review_body": "I have only a couple of devices that work on the 5Ghz but that's not a big deal. I bought this device as \"future proof\" for later products. I also needed the better range and power. I didn't really get a better range. I live in a two story 2500 sq ft house. The signal is just barely two bars in my kitchen which is one room below and one room over from the router. Even in the room next door we have some drop off. Set up wasn't too difficult. It found my network and got me right on. Cool! It took a second to figure where to update the device's password, but it wasn't difficult. There are some preset key codes for your wireless. The documentation says not to change them as they're also imprinted to the bottom of the machine for safe keeping. Um, no. I changed that to a stronger key code and have it stored for safe keeping....my head (32 charachters no less!). The guest network availability is cool, but I gave it a key code as well. I've got too many kids hanging out around the house that I don't want them bogging down my system. All said, there are six different locations for keys. The WPS works very well and is pretty simple...as it should be. There is also the availability of a pin. I did use this for one pc as the WPS just couldn't seem to connect. There are lots of bells and whistles that I've barely explored. I did try the parental control app but it said my router wasn't eligible despite being on the list.\n\nAfter a couple days of having it we started to notice intermittent drop offs for the wireless. We have devices in our home dependent on that signal and if they lose it, they turn on full power and start searching. That is very annoying. After a month it got worse. Every pc was crawling on the internet. I wondered if maybe something was up with the router or the modem. I harwired directly to my modem and had no issues. Sending the signal back through the router, I got issues. I then went into the router settings and discovered there was a firmware update. That's cool, and not cool. I shouldn't have to log in to check for that. That said, it was painless to upgrade. I hoped maybe it would reset and reboot and all would be well. It wasn't. I wound up doing a hard reset of the whole unit and had to go through the arduos task of putting in keys, reattaching wireless devices, and testing connections. But the connection is back to normal. We'll see how that goes in a week. I wouldn't really recommend this product. I've seen a lot of comments in the general area mine are aimed, and frankly that's too many. I am an IT so I know something about these things. It's too bad this thing isn't better especially given the high rating it has. But maybe all those negatives are IT guys like me who expect better or at least what we've paid for.\n\nOne year later and I'm looking for a new router. This is just a terrible device. It constantly drops signal and is even rebooting on it's own multiple times a day. I just can't have that.",

                "review_body": "The reason I got this model was to take advantage of its dual band and hope for something more powerful. I upgraded from an old Linksys WRT54G that has long overdue its service for what I need. Let's talk numbers.\n\nPreviously my computer closest to the router was getting 30 mbps and with this it's now at 70 mbps. My smart tv went from 14 mbps to 48 mbps. This definitely warrants an upgrade and future proofs internet options with its 5G. I am located in Arizona and here we're finally rolling out Gigabyte internet, so I am looking forward to testing this unit's 5G. Streaming 4K Netflix is instantaneous and consistent. There haven't been any disconnects or drop in streaming quality for a whole program. Alongside that there are hardly any compression artifacts with this buffering speed. Even across the opposite end of the house I still have a stable connection.\n\nSetup was fast and easy for me. All my devices connected quickly and without error after plugging in. The router has a nice interface that is easy to navigate and find what you're looking for; nothing too cryptic. The QR-code login feature is really cool if you're using a long key phrase for security. There's nothing more frustrating than punching in a key only to have to re-enter it again. This is one of the more user friendly routers I've used, I cant imagine going back to the Linksys router. Really great router especially for the price. Just regard it the same as any other router. Be sure you've set it up properly then all should be well.\n\nBeginner Advice:\nI've been reading through the reviews and there seems to be some misunderstandings in regards to speeds. This supports speeds just over 800 mpbs. However if you're not paying for this speed with your ISP you will not obtain these speeds with the router. You're capped by the speeds fed through the modem. So you'll need to check what your plan is and compare. You also need to consider the hardware such as your network card inside the computer and modem model. If your PC isn't older than 3 years than this shouldn't be an issue.\n\nIf you're still not getting the desire speeds you'll need to take the physics into consideration. The waves bounce through the air and there's interference. I recommend an android app called Wifi Analyzer to check your environment. Make sure you're not sharing channels with your neighbor, this will cause interference between broadcasts. Sometimes a simple move of the router will fix issues. This is because waves cancel out at certain lengths. So if your connected device is positioned at a \"dead spot\" you wont get optimal speeds.",

                "review_body": "I used to use NETGEAR products exclusively since 2000 when their equipment still sported \"Bay Networks\" logo.  I also used to buy their ProSafe line of products and they were great.  You'd swear I worked for them if you looked at my home office with patch panels, punch-down block and all NETGEAR products.  I recommended to all my clients to buy NETGEAR because they were great products.  Then I started noticing that they really haven't kept up to date with their competitors.  I started replacing my switches with D-Link gigabit switches.  Then my NAS with Synology 1511+ simply because of their quality workmanship and software was far superior to NETGEAR's.  However, I still stuck with NETGEAR for routers and range extenders.  Then my router, WNDR3700AV, stopped working (restoring to factory default and reinstalling updates didn't help) so I replaced it with this one. I thought about getting their Nighthawk, but decided to get this to first decide if I should continue buying NETGEAR products before spending $200+ given some negative reviews it was receiving.\n\nThe R6200v2 router does have much better range, however I now have to restart it on a weekly-basis.  It still appears to be functioning by broadcasting its SSID, but you can't connect to it.  I can still get to its administrative Web-based console using one their gigabit port, but not out to the Internet.  Unplugging & plugging it back is the only way to correct the problem, but this is not acceptable.  If NETGEAR doesn't release a new firmware soon (I'm already running their latest firmware) I will start looking for a replacement from another vendor.\nOh, I flashed my old WNDR3700 with dd-wrt and it's actually working again (thus pointing to their firmware).  Since my house is pre-wired, I connected the 3700 to a gigabit ethernet port at the other end of my house.  This is giving me much better performance and stability, I got rid of my WN2500RP repeater.  The 3700 with dd-wrt firmware is working out so great I may just flash this damn R6200 with dd-wrt as well (I haven't had any problems with the 3700 since flashing with dd-wrt).  Either way, if I have to replace any new router's firmware (i.e. OS), then whats the point of buying their product because all I'm paying for will be the hardware.  I'd rather give my money to a vendor that is willing to continue improving both their hardware and software...wouldn't you?",

                "review_body": "I purchased this Netgear router to replace an N600 that died (wireless antennas failed). I was debating between this and the highest Netgear model, but chose this for a couple of reasons: 1) My useage for streaming videos was (has not been) considerably high; 2) my download/uploads are usually limited to photographs and small youtube streaming.\n\nPros:\n- Installation is very simple. After removing my old router and turning off all associated devices, I was literally online within 10 minutes after restarting power to my modem and router.\n- Solid performance through internal walls. With my previous N600, I had to purchase an extender since I was unable to get signal into my master bedroom (a mere 20 ft away, but through three internal bedrooms). I am able to receive 5G performance (~50 Mbs); 2.5Ghz spectrum performs about the same, although the signal (using Wifi Analyzer app) shows a stronger signal.\n- Simple configuration. I am able to separate the two spectrums (5Ghz and 2.5Ghz) and create two separate networks. Basically, I keep my network ID as, \"X,\" for the 2.5; and \"X-5G,\" for the other. This allows me to choose the appropriate wifi network based upon my location within my house or front yard.\n\nCons;\n- Swith/internal ports or only 100Mbps (not Gigabit). Not a huge deal breaker, but there are still those who prefer to be \"plugged-in.\"\n- Limited to number of devices that can be attached to wife. As wifi becomes ever increasing, this can limit a household with several cell phones, tablets, laptops, and entertainment systems. Fortunately, my wife and I are only a couple of devices at once (our cell phones are usually connected), Ipad, and PC",

                "review_body": "Pretty good router overall.  I bought this as a replacement for my Amped wireless extender for my guesthouse. Now don't get me wrong, the Amped wireless extender is darn good and actually is faster... an AC1750 however, It's located just at the edge where the signals drop off from my main router. This means, I only get about 3 bars... but good enough to wireless feed my guesthouse. So what was the problem? Well, anytime there's bad weather or just plain a windy day, I basically lose those 3 bars and my guest house is dead in the water. And the unfortunate and main issue is, that wireless extender does not have a ethernet IN port. Thus, I picked this Netgear up to compensate. Here are my findings...\n\nPROS:\n- Relatively fast.\n- Pretty reliable and stable.... hasn't dropped connection and latency is hardly noticeable.\n- Plenty of ethernet ports and nice to have a USB 3.0 for NAS set up.\n\nCONS:\n- More a personal preference, but don't like how it stands up-right. You can technically lay it down, but it's awkward in the design.\n- Weak wireless range. With my old Amped wireless extender, I can go as far back as to my garden and still have 2 bars. This one, I can't even make it to my garden.\n\nNevertheless it does its job and works pretty well.",

                "review_body": "Background:\nI bought the R6200 to replace a Ubiquity AirRouter that kept crashing, despite getting the firmware update. Our house is around 3800 sf with my computer, router, printers, etc on one end of the house and kids TV room all the way on the other side. Connections we have include: 1 WIFI TV; 1 WIFI DVD player; 4 iPads; 1 Desktop; 2 laptops; 3 amazon kindles; 2 wireless printers; 1 xBox 360; 1PS3; and three Apple TVs--no problems with these. The average number of connections active is 8 devices when everyone is home and \"busy.\" Netflix streaming with the WIFI TV was fine (no buffering stoppages!) without the extender, 50-60 feet away & through 4 walls; I used the extender just to get the signal to 4/4 bars. I bought a NETGEAR Range Extender prior to this router purchase and like the ease of set up on that product so I figured I would stay in the NETGEAR family.\n\nRange: The R6200 is good enough to cover my entire house and my backyard patio without the extender. The radio signal is powered by stronger amplifier chips--you get what you pay for.\n\nSetUp:  The instructions in the included booklet worked fine.  I performed by setup with the cat 5 cable and not wirelessly. When you plug your cat 5 cable from the R6200 to a computer that has an ethernet port, opening a browser should invoke the NETGEAR setup page and if it doesn't, you will have to manually enter the simple URL address. Once you do this, it can take a minute or so for the page to load, so you may have to be patient--you may think it isn't working! I almost thought this.\n\nLikes: 1) Range is excellent. Having dual bands is great to utilize the 5 Ghz band for devices close to the router that can take advantage of the higher frequency without range being an issue and let the other stuff hang on the 2.4 Ghz frequency. 2) It worked out of the box by following the instructions. 3)The configuration software allows you to setup separate SSIDs (and name WIFI and guest). 4) USB connection that allows access to a network printer or shared hard drive. 4)Network Genie app is really easy to use and you can apply parental controls to your devices. 5) four days running and not one single outage and I have a good mix of stuff that hangs off this wifi, so I am delighted. 6) Firmware upgrade automatically started right after install--no issues.7) Supports Airprint so iPads and iPhones can print to my wireless printers. Their tech support is really good--this router has a 1 year warranty, which is solid. I had a question around naming my 5G SSID and they nailed it 2 minutes--the registration process is a little arduous though....\n\nDislikes: Unit is pretty large. They actually should make it a digital frame!",

                "review_body": "I love the router. I just want to counter what another reviewer said about this won't work with static IP addresses. He must not be a good IT guy. Because under advanced settings, you specify your subnet and mask and that page has a place for IP reservations. If you need the more advanced functions like that, they are there and work great. If you don't need them, it still works great plug and play.\n\nI've got the whole house hard wired. Gig network. I like the reliability and speed afforded by such a situation. However. The old 802.11g router needed an upgrade. Well, it didn't. But, I decided I would anyway. The kids and family have enough tablets and phones that are dependent on the wifi, one TV that streams over wifi (too lazy to add a router there, another device already has the ethernet port) would sometimes need to buffer. Time to upgrade from the little 54Mb g connection.\n\nThis router is dual band. All the new fancy phones and everything will connect to the 5gz n signal. That is broadcast here at over 800 megs a second. That's quite an upgrade. A couple of older devices only can see the 2.4ghz signal and they share a dedicated 300 meg connection. No more buggering issues. The signal is stronger than the old router so better coverage inside the house and even outside of it a little bit.\n\nI'm very impressed so far. I'd love to get one of the nighthawk's with tri band from netgear. But I don't see dropping $300 on a router! This will more than do for now. We can even stream video on multiple devices now, no problem. I've set up a USB hard drive for DLNA streaming. Just did a test on it and it works great. We'll be using that more shortly.",

Your network is not secure since your first kiss link. However, it seems any similar product made in China has this issue.\n\nSecond, after one or two trials, APP cannot change password and cannot change advanced setting. Even five times of factory reset doesn't help.

The best solution to extend Wifi that I have found so far is to use Powerline Ethernet (Well - its not really wifi but it gives you solid Wired Internet for the devices that are Wired such as Smart TV etc).  Yes, I know all my reviews are *critiques* and may come out a bit too negative. But I'd like to send a message to these Tech companies. They could learn a lesson (or two) from Apple.",

At first it was hard to set up, but that is because it was so simple and I made it hard... A \"DUH\" moment. My husband is a lot happier because his speed is much faster. I look forward to seeing more products from Keewifi. Keewifi might be a \"starter\" company, but they have a great product! I am very pleased with the customer support. The Keewifi team are personable, courteous, quickly responds to consumer product questions, assists without hesitation, and all of these are important to me. I suggested the password on the bottom of the kisslink be larger print because it was hard for my older eyes to see.. and the team wrote back and have decided to implement larger print. I am glad they are attentive to customer suggestions.. this also makes a great team and better product!! I already wrote a review earlier this month, yet apparently it was not posted, so I hope this one is!! I recommend this product to others!!",

It arrived 12 hours after I ordered it (BLESS AMAZON PRIME) it was super easy to set up and my connection immediately improved. I used to only get 1 bar in my bedroom and now I get all 3! I reccomend downloading the app, it enables you to name your network and change the color of the led light. My only complaint is that it's range isn't huge... I only get 3 bars when I'm 15 feet away from the router, and when I leave my bedroom the connection is gone... If you're thinking about using this as a a main router I reccomend purchasing more than one of these so that it stretches across",

After one set-up, all the mobile devices can connect to the internet with one touch, or I should say - let your device 'kiss' it ;)\n\nWith this wonderful feature, I cannot wait to invite my friend for a party at my house. It will definitely amaze them when they ask for wifi connection. Guess I cannot wait till they ask.\n\nI was wondering how to connect my desktop computer. So I contacted their customer service, Simba. He is very patient and helpful. From him, I learnt that there is a 'hidden' connection called 'X', which is using the traditional password method. He also told me two other methods, like downloading the app to add desktop as trusted. Will try to download the app and give it a try later.\n\nSo if you get this smart device, you'll get two equally secure ways for connection, plus a fancier kiss way to show off to your friends :D",

The instructions are fairly good , but it was more helpful to go to the website for a fuller explanation. They have several short videos for each intended use, and definitely worth checking out. While I do get a stronger signal at a distance from the router , the speed is not as great as that from the primary router on the primary home network. However, if you are in a situation where you have trouble connecting reliably to the primary router, this gives decent speed in the more remote parts of your network. It is easy to use with a guest device, albeit through an open network which is not password-protected, but is proximity protected. I don't want to always share my password with certain visitors, such as children and pet sitters, for example, and this keeps them off my primary network as well. The unit is very lightweight , and without a stand, so can be easily pulled over even by the weight of the power cord.  I gave it 4 stars because of the drop in network speed and instability, but would say it's a 4 plus.",

The only reason I even decided to try this device was at the recommendation of a family member who had success with it.\n\nI am not overall impressed with the setup. After reading online reviews and warnings my roadblocks appear to be widespread of users of this device.  When entering your wifi password for your network it times out, which then requires a reset of the kisslink to have it even allow you to try again.  After trying this about 15 times or so I gave up and moved on to trying to install the app to update the firmware as I believe the manual tells you to try.  This became an entirely separate issue all together.  The app continually tells me that I am not the administrator.  I have kissed my phone to it about a thousand times and held it up to it to get me added as the admin and it just does not work. I am unable to update the firmware as the manual and website say I should need to in order to get the page to enter my wifi password to not time out.  If you don't support most routers then you really should update your product before releasing it to the mass public.\n\nI will be returning this item as I do not have the time or energy to deal with it any longer.

It's not hard, just follow the instructions carefully and be patient. Remember you need to plug it into your modem/main router first (or anything connected to your wifi) and let it flip from orange to blue, and then you can plug it in (power only, no network cable) anywhere and it's ready to go as a range extender. There's an app you can download to change settings.\n\nIf you ask me, the principal use is as a range extender. If you can locate it in an area where your guests also congregate, great. It's highly portable and seems to do well in terms of maintaining signal strength. I think the best use would be at a large party or event where you need to segregate the networks from each other.\n\nIt's cute and fits in the current trend of white + curves = tech chic trend of industrial design, so it should fit in your home regardless of decor.",

After a few tries I was able to  finally connect it.  Then I had another user try to connect to the device and that failed to work.  Over the next four months I would try different options, different settings, DHCP, static IP, everything I could think of.  The latest issue is that, while I could get the device to show connection to the main router, it kept trying to get a firmware update.  It would sit for sometimes over an hour with no data connection.\n\nI really REALLY wanted this to work.  I was so excited to have a separate range extender that looks cute sitting on our bar that would allow our guests to connect to a wifi network that was \"almost\" completely separate from our own.  Sadly, this let me down.  I hope that they can perfect it as I think it has real potential but I would not recommend it to anyone.",

                "review_body": "First, I have not received anything for this review. In fact, I purchased this unit about 8 months ago for $59 here on Amazon. Second, I rarely write reviews. I am extremely impressed with the this product ( I am using it as a range extender). Why the glowing review after 8 months? We recently replaced a router and the customer service has been top notch, which (in my experience) is extremely rare with anything tech related. Here is the story. When I initially received the Kisslink it worked great right out of the box. For the record, it took me a little longer than it should have to set it up, but I am NOT a techie at all and I still got it together super quick. Most impressive however is that after our new router was put in place, I just couldn't get the Kisslink to work properly.  Tried a few times and made sure I was entering information properly and it was a no go. I called Kisslink, expecting to wait forever and not be able to talk with anyone. But like I said, I knew I realy liked the product and wanted it to work again. Anyway, I took a leap of faith and called and -- get this -- they actually answered the phone and I spoke to someone who took me through the set up procedure. She tranferred me to someone else when it didn't work properly. The next person tried to help as well, very politely I might add. This is the person who told me that my call was being \"elevated\" and that someone with more experience would call me soon. I receive an email documenting the situation and the elevated status of my difficulty. And then, amazingly, I got a call within 24 hours. Tony walked me through a couple tests and we couldn't get it to work, but he didn't give up. He figured out a way and pushed an update while I was sleeping. Lo and behold, it's working like a charm AGAIN! After the update, he called a couple times and missed me and then emailed to arrange a time to talk ao he could check to make sure all was well. I know, unbelievable, right? I can only hope that these guys keep creating cool stuff to make my tech life work better. Best $59 I've spent in a long time.",

I saw this listing, did some research and I took a chance on this product and was very pleased with the product. I did some research on it and found that the design, execution, methodology of it was absolute genius! Even my friends were fascinated by it.\n\nThe design:\nSimple. Clean. Modern. There's nothing I love more than something I can put on my counter-top that looks great with any environment. The led ring light gives it another aesthetically pleasing feature.\n\nThe way it works\nIt works as an extender for your existing ISP. There is a default WEP key on the bottom or you can hold your device to the it and wait for it to beep (accept) your specific device that you want to connect and it remembers it! That's the genius part. Next time you have a party or some friends over, they don't have to ask you for the password, which may be long and cumbersome to type it. Instead, they can just scan their phone and connect in as little as 30 seconds.\n\nTechnical issues\nI did have some technical issues setting it up and sometimes the extender would need to be reset. However, the technical support for this product is stellar and friendly.\n\nOverall\nI really like the overall design and smarts behind the product. This is a great piece to have in your house or apartment that is well worth the money.",

When I placed my iPad and Android devices near it, it did connect,but my wifi showed two connections, one open and one that looked secured with a similar name. However, when I tried to connect to the secured one, it would not let me, kept saying it could not authenticate my password and I was not given a default password in the documentation. When I connected to the open signal, I launched a browser thinking I can manually enter my info, as per the instructions, but it did not let me enter anything, it never connected to any login page that the instructions said it would. So after an hour of knocking my head around, I called the tech support number in the manual for customer service. The person on the other end of line answered the phone as if it was a freind that was calling with a simple \"Hello\" and I had to ask a few times if this was a wrong number of if it was the actual company. At that point, when I asked if this is indeed Keewifi company and that I had some questions, the person on the other line said nothing other then, \"Yeah, go ahead\".\n\nSorry, once I heard that I said forget it. Seems unprofessional people run this company, extremely unprofessional! I did not feel comfortable giving information to them about my issue or if they asked me any questions.",

Make the \"touch to connect\" network name hidden, so that other people will not try to hack into it somehow, and we will not need to be prompted all the time from KeeWifi iPhone app to notice you about new device trying to connect into our network, it's annoying\n2). Change the function of \"Zen\" button, this is very very important!, ALERT ALERT, DO NOT use the \"Zen\" button anytime, because if your neighbors trying to connect to your network and in the meanwhile you press the \"Zen\" button, you granted access to your neighbors! For the function of resetting the router, manufacturer should change it into long press to reset. For the function of granting access for desktop computer, see belowing:\n3). Make the secured network name also hidden, and make 2 passwords for that network, when we need to connect a desktop computer, you input 1st password and hit connect, within 10 seconds, press \"Zen\" button 1 time, then your desktop computer will show password mistake, but don't worry, now you input 2nd password and hit connect, within 10 seconds, press \"Zen\" button 2 times, then your desktop computer connected! In this way, no one will be able to hack to use your network.\nThese changes will make the KeeWifi solid steel safe!",

It even came with some instructions on how to update my PC wireless adapter driver so it would be current.  That was an easy update too.  My service is 400MBs and I'm getting 450+ MBs using Speed Test.\n\nI don't do any gaming but I am a heavy duty business and TV streaming user.  I've tried out the gaming port for a conference call.  It resolved my video conference call issues that I've been having.  The calls were buffering along with losing the audio and video.  The priority port allowed for a smooth call while the TV and multiple tablets were streaming at the same time.\n\nThis is the best looking router I've had.  I like the lights in the front.  :)",

I started having issues with my $400 Nighthawk tri-band router after they started updating the firmware every few months. I get it, security patches, performance, yadayada. Then I started having 5ghz band issues and loss of connection. Then slow speeds, I\u2019m talking 1.2mbps WiFi speed on a 200meg fiber to home service. I played with the comparable Asus at the work office and was going to get it but realized the hardware is 2017 hardware. Then I saw this lil guy but was hesitant due to only dual band.\nI read the reviews. Still hesitant. Price dropped $20 so I ordered one.\nJUST DO IT! This router is nuts compared to my Netgear (when it was working correctly). WiFi 6 and 160mhz gives this little router more range than my tri band Netgear. The UI panel is so much better than netgears is. I now get 206mb down on 5ghz and 2.4ghz with 14 devices connected. VPN compatible built into the router and even TimeMachine backup via usb3. I have zero issues with Ethernet connections as well, my speed increased from 2-300kbps on work vpn to 2.5mbps. No more robot teams or Skype calls on WFH days thanks to QoS settings available within the UI panel!\nI am waiting for a good sale and will get a second one and set up as mesh so I can get WiFi on my backyard patio and shed :)",

If I could enable the performance and security options without being tied to the Cloud AI this would be 5 stars.. so thankfully the router is very stable and performs very well without the AI Cloud components on.\n\nOne note to be aware of this will not increase your distance over your last router but if you use 802.11AX WiFi6 that will highly increase the speed for those devices.  I leave WiFi6 enabled but split the 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz networks to allow my IOT devices to play nice on the 2.4Ghz SSID with WiFi6 AX enabled on the 5Ghz SSID\n\nDo you need a new Router?  This one is a solid choice.",

                "review_body": "I recently moved into a condo and subscribed to the Comcast/Xfinity cable/internet package with 200 MB download speed. I had been using a 9 year dual band Linksys EA6500 router but I figured it was probably time to upgrade to a better unit.  I read a lot of reviews and decided the RT-AX82U was the most highly rated unit for its price point. I ran some wireless speed tests using dslreports.com with my old router and compared them to the new RT-AX82U.  The results were pretty shocking. With the old router I was pretty much maxed out at 22 MB/s on either 2.4 or 5 GHZ.  I configured the RT-AX82U for dual band with smartconnect off, wifi 6 enabled for the 5GHz band and disabled for the 2.4 GHz band.  My 2.4 GHz wireless speed jumped to 85 MB/s and the 5GHz jumped to 230 MB/s!  I have been running the router for 2 weeks now with no glitches or dropped devices.  The router software interface is very easy to use and adjust settings.  The Asus mobile app also works great and allows you to monitor your network, track all the connected devices, update firmware, change the LED light colors, etc.  I would definitely recommend upgrading to this router if you are still running an older router with slow wireless throughput speeds.",

                "review_body": "Edit: I ordered this again on Saturday, once I saw Asus pushed a firmware update on Thanksgiving after seeing they also recently update the firmware on the XT8s recently. (The almost 100 off retail also pushed me to grab it)\n\nAs another reviewer confirmed, this firmware fixed the upload speed issue with Fios (obviously I couldn't narrow the issue originally, hehe).  I can now recommend the router.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOriginal Review:\nTo preface, I was using an Asus XT8 already and it's been great.  I wanted to get a little ahead of Fios (hopefully) rolling out multigig speeds in my area, along with going with some Unifi waps for wifi.  With this being said,  the current issues that I and other users are having, seem to apply regardless of you even having 1gbps or 100mbps upload speeds, again at least with Verizon Fios.\n\nThe literal only issue I see with this router is the 2.5g wan port. The max my upload would hit 4-40mbps.\n\nAfter using the router for a few days, I jumped on a call with Verizon and confirmed that there was nothing special that would need to be done to get this to work at full upload speeds. I had an old Nighthawk too, came right up, full gig speeds. I tried restarting the ONT to see if that would correct the issue but nogo.\n\nSo, it doesn't really look like a Verizon Fios issue.  Some users got around this by enabling dual wan with a lan port acting as wan, but that defeats the literal purpose of \"upgrading\" to this router.  I would honestly be relieved in the future if this was just a firmware issue but for users with a similar setup (Fios), I don't think it's ready.\n\nI've seen online reviewers getting far greater speeds so maybe it's even a hardware issue that a replacement would correct, but I don't have the time to jerk around with this right now so I'd rather just refund it and wait and see in the future if this is corrected.\n\nOtherwise, the router works like any other current gen Asus router, just with a gamery skin and some other gamer focused QOS settings, which is a welcomed inclusion The router looks great externally too.  The giant strix logo on top is nice, since I have TUF gaming and Strix hardware around the house and lights up my network closet a little so it's not pitch black when I open the door.\n\nTLDR; I'm returning this strictly based on the upload speed on primary wan. Be weary and don't throw anything out if you buy this, at least until you can confirm speeds are working as they should.",

                "review_body": "Bought this after Dong recommended it in one of his blog posts for the 2.5gbit throughput from wan to lan since our 600mbit comcast plan is over provisioned at almost 1.5gbits down. I flashed the Merlin open source firmware onto it almost immediately since I prefer the security and power user features of open source projects like OpenWrt and DD-wrt. Then I almost returned it as the wifi connection to our android phones disconnected/reconnected every 10 seconds plus numerous other software bugs, glitches and inability to setup any advanced features via cli. Turned out the problem wasn't the hardware. It was Merlin. That open source project is a useless joke compared to OpenWrt. I realize that Merlin is constrained by the closed source nature of the newer AX chips, but still I could not figure out what it added beyond what you can actually do since the stock firmware is Linux based and the GUI lets you set up SSH CLI access to a vast and complete set of Linux networking and firewall executables of which the GUI (stock or Merlin) barely scrapes the surface. IMO the ssh -> Linux access, which I have not seen in any other consumer grade router allows these to be turned into PROsumer network devices including multi vlan (port and 801q) support, outbound and inter-subnet firewall configs, dual wan, wan and lan port aggregation plus many more features unavailable on the 'consumer' grade crap. Decided to de-install Merlin and it could not be any more stable now. So not only decided to keep it, but I'm adding an additional AX86S as an access point with a 2gbit wired backhaul. My network consists of about 40ish wifi IoT devices, many more non wifi IoT, some streaming cams plus a lot of streamed TV, plus multiple phones and laptops that require network segmentation (a buzzword that is alien in the home user market). But the ASUS can do it if you are willing to roll up your sleeves and wrestle with the CLI. Having a professional network and software engineering background doesn't hurt, but it's easy enough to hire a skilled IT/Linux programmer to assist in configuring  the enterprise grade features not supported by the GUI. IMO this ~$300 'consumer/gamer' router can be transformed into $1-2K enterprise grade security gateway, and it is one of the only consumer brands where the stock firmware allows (not to mention it is also one of the few remaining CONsumer brands that does not spy on you via required cloud accounts and phone apps just to configure the router) CLI access.  All in all, on the surface it seems like a fairly good, 3.5 star product, but the hidden value with full access to Linux CLI networking commands like vlanctl, brctl, ifconfig, ip, iptables, ebtables, etc places the overall value off the charts.\n\nI should also mention that I was stupid enough to invest in a pair of Eero 6Es for my collection of insecure, spyware IoT devices. Having the Asus sitting in front of and firewalling those privacy invading nightmares to block ET from phoning home to China could not be more golden in my book.",

However it had a bad habit of occasionally dropping connections and I wound up replacing it with a newer ASUS AX router which also wound up dropping clients and finally replaced that with a stable Netgear Nighthawk router. I packed this router up but kept it. Fast forward to now and I decided to dust it off and see if I could set it up in bridge mode so I could connect my upstairs bedroom smart TV to it via ethernet. After a factory reset, I was able to easily set this up in bridge mode, connect my TV via ethernet and get a strong and fast signal -- success!!. I cannot speak to how this would work these days as a main router, but note that there is a firmware update (which I executed) which does fix a number of bugs. Regardless, as a bridge (or possibly a repeater) this router works fine and I am glad I now have a good use for it!! Btw, the current price for this is very reasonable, considering it capabilities.",

                "review_body": "I recently moved into an area that offered 1.2GB download speeds. I was using the service provider equipment at a cost of $25 additional per month. The equipment was an all in one modem+router which also had a 2.5g port. In an effort to save some money, I decided to purchase and invest in a new Router and Modem for the service. The caveat being that I will lose out on Unlimited data using my own equipment which was a risk I was willing to take. I bought the AX6000 to pair with a Arris S33 2.5g port Surfboard Modem as the AX6000 has a 2.5g port as well.\n\nThe Asus AX6000 packaged arrived pristine with no physical damage. Setup - be very careful with the Antennas, I noticed that one my antennas for the router was not tightening properly, you have to ensure you can adjust without breaking the antenna. I noticed my antenna sounded like it was about to break as I was adjusting to access the bottom of the antenna to tighten. The process to get the Router up and running was a breeze, I used my sons Desktop PC hard wired into the 2.5G port and the browser recognized the router pretty quickly. Once my Arris S33 modem was activated, the router acquired the IP very quickly. At this point once I acquired the IP, I immediately did a speed test and....the speed remained the same as the ISP rental equipment. I did not lose out on speed; ISP equipment speedtest was 914GB down and 25up and with the Asus AX6000+Arris S33 was equally the same. I was hoping to at least get some increase in speed (this test was wired). I continued with my setup and began to open ports for my sons games. I noticed that the interface has port forwarding in two areas which was a bit confusing, I used the gaming section to port forward and i believe i have set it up correctly as i did not receive and conflict notification. Also, this is limited to a max of 38 ports. I am not sure what is the difference between the Gaming NAT section and the Port Forwarding section of the router and I found this to be confusing.\n\nWiFi Range seemed to be very good and I did see a slight improvement in range against the ISP rental Modem+Router. My laptop would struggle with zoom calls when i used it outside in my backyard, I did not test zoom with the new router in that area but i noticed the wifi status bar on my laptop improved. I have a number of devices that are on WiFi IoT's + Gaming Consoles. Xbox Series X download speeds are equally the same as the rental equipment and no decrease in speed or increase unfortunately.\n\nOverall I am happy with the Asus AX6000 but I was hoping for a bit of speed boost for 2.5G port. Even the dedicated gaming port did not improve this. I was going to give it 4 stars for that but so far it's remained stable with not decrease in performance so that will keep it at 5 stars for now.\n\nBonus:\nIn my previous location, I had 2 Asus AX-3000 routers which i kept, these were being used with AT&T's Modem in Passthrough. I decided to put these in Mesh Mode with the AX6000, this was extremely easy to do. I now have 1 AX3000 in my Laundry and 1 in the master bedroom. Devices seem to hop from the mesh without problem and I have increase range all throughout the home.",

                "review_body": "10/14/23:  My initial experience with this product? It's flying along (and even looks like a spaceship).  At first I tried an RT-AX58U which has great 5 ghz speeds but some devices were stuck getting 60-70 mbps download speeds over 2.4 ghz.  Too bad because I liked the lower power consumption of that model (most of the time at 6 watts or lower power consumption).  Now I also have aan RT-AX88U which performs really well on both 2.4 and 5 ghz but consumes on average 8-9 watts and frequently peaks just over 10 watts.  Because I'm trying to lower electricity costs in my home,  I  eventually tried this model (which was overlooked previously because of its lights.  Not into the rgb thing).  I should've gone with this model in the first place!  Those same devices are getting 107-110 mbps download speeds over 2.4 ghz. In fact,  performance is very close to the RT-AX88U!  Of course performance over 5 ghz is stellar like both the RT-AX58U  and RT-AX88U where my phone that supports wifi 6 gets 370+ mbps and my older phone that supports wifi 5 gets 360+ mbps download speeds.  I'm still on a Spectrum 300 mbps plan so this is great for what I have! Upload speeds are only 12 mbps on all devices which is expected with a coaxial cable connection.  Power consumption is right where I want it at 6-7 watts most of the time (heavy streaming of 4k and 1080p content on  2-3 devices with a mixture of work devices and phones making up the remainder of the workload here).  Ultimately this review is much earlier than I'd normally write one so I can't comment on longevity.  Will update later about that.  So far I'm impressed!",

Right off the bat, I noticed that the router wasn't bulky (a major plus) and it  included a short ethernet cable to set it with my modem. The instructions were clear, concise and I was able to get it up and running within 5-10 minutes. Upon usage, I can definitely say that this router is reliable in terms of connectivity and pretty fast.\n\nFeatures:\nThe router I purchased has four ethernet ports, one USB 3.0 port, fast wireless connectivity, and even a dedicated app which lets you customize settings to optimize performance for work, gaming, and even casual use. Within the app, you are also able to turn off the LED lights and change the Aura RGB on the router. Not to mention, it also has a security feature to protect against malicious attacks.\n\nPerformance:\nThe performance on this router is impressive; A major upgrade from what I had before. We tested its performance using various devices, including PCs, laptops, smart TVs, Gaming Consoles and it delivered a fast and reliable connection.\n\nUE:\nThe router is easy to set up and use. Once everything is set up, you can use the mobile app-based to manage various settings, including parental controls and QoS optimization. Although, I would say that mobile app design can be a little confusing for those who are locating specific features since some just show icons with no text. Nonetheless, after messing with the app, you will be fine.\n\nConclusion:\nI can definitely say that this router has impressed me, especially for the price. It's a great choice for people who want something simple yet reliable. Although the UI may throw some people off, this router is a great option for those who value performance and reliability. As time goes by, I can definitely keep this updated.",

                "review_body": "This is one of the very few consumer routers that provides a single 2.5Gb WAN and single 2.5Gb LAN. Currently, I with Xfinity's 1Gb plan and am able to get speeds over 1Mbps with a previous of 500 to 600Gbps. This router is currently paired with ARRIS' Surfboard S33 DOCSIS 3.1 modem, which also has a 2.5Gb port. I do wish manufactures would begin implementing multiple 2.5Gb LAN ports. My PC is attached to a 2.5Gb switch which is then connected to the 2.5Gb LAN port located on the router. Hopefully, with this setup I've future proof myself somewhat but only time will tell.\n\nWiFi 6 on 5GHz is relatively quick as well. Reaching speeds of 400 to 900Mbps depending on distance. This leaves for little buffering time on watching videos on my phone and downloading apps quickly.\n\nI'm familiar with ASUS's user interface. I've yet to try out their MESH system but as our home is fairly small so there hasn't been a need to set this up with an older ASUS router. The traffic analyzer fails to work consistently to monitor bandwidth usage. The user interface has a plethora of options to dig through and adjust.\n\nOverall, this is a great wireless router. The RGB setting isn't really needed just an added feature for the \"cool\" factor.",

If you're here reading reviews, then you already know this is one of the best WiFi6 routers you can buy. Instead, I want to talk about my experience buying it used off Amazon Warehouse. This is a costly router. I saw that the warehouse had two used ones that were rated as \"Used - Good.\" There's no other information, just that it was \"good\". But it was significantly cheaper than buying new. What I received looks to me like a brand-new router. I'm attaching photos to my review so you can see what \"Used - Good\" looks like from the warehouse. There was not a scratch on it, that I could find. It came in the original box and nothing was missing. And it still had the peel-off protectors on it. YMMV, but that was my experience. I'm glad I bought it used from the warehouse.\n\nAs far as the router itself, it's awesome. You can tweak just about anything in this router. ASUS rocks!",

The auto configuration worked as expected but you can also set up the network manually if you choose. One area for improvement here is assigning SSID to your wireless channels. For some reason the setup names your 2.4 and 5.0 channels the same name even if you are trying to manually assign them during setup. This means that you must correct that if you want a unique broadcast SSID for each band.\n\nGUI - Once familiarized with the web GUI the interface if excellent. For the most part options are clearly presented in common sense easy to understand fashion. All \"pro\" tools are easily accessible including WAN, LAN, Wireless, Guest Network, QOS, etc. The best part about the web GUI is when making changes to the options. Never once locked up, failed to respond, or save and remember setting changes.\n\n2.4 Band - excellent signal strength throughout a 2,100 sq. ft. two story home.\n5.0 Band - nothing stellar, but not terrible either. All devices operating on the 5.0 band were able to connect and hold a signal. This included TVs, laptops, tablets, and cell phone in use from one corner of the residence to the other.\n\nAppearance - I didn't buy this router for the gaming aesthetics, but for potential performance and ability to support 12 -18 devices connected simultaneously. It seems to handle that workload well. As long as I can game on my wired PC, while the wife or grandkids stream movies, videos, YouTube etc. everyone is happy. In that regard no complaints yet.",

                "review_body": "Our house has been filling up with many wifi 6 devices so early in the year, we finally transitioned to a wifi6 capable router, the Netgear AX5400.\n\nIn short summary, the ASUS AX5400 is better in every possible way than the Netgear it replaced, even with both being AX5400 speed.\n\nStability:\nThis was my absolute number 1 priority and requirement for a wireless router.  The ASUS has been rock solid and stable.  All devices connect without issue and do not drop.  The Netgear would randomly drop a device for no reason at all, logs never showed anything.  The ASUS router has never randomly rebooted and lost internet.  The Netgear would randomly lose internet until a forced reset.  The stability issues with the Netgear was driving my family and me crazy and this was the reason we got the ASUS.  I'm very meticulous about our settings and firmware updates so I understood very well how to setup each router.  The Netgear just wasn't very stable.\n\nSpeed:\nThe ASUS 5Ghz speeds are very fast as expected.  The speeds are pretty much identical to the Netgear it replaced.  The 2.4Ghz speeds are actually slightly slower than the Netgear, but I actually do not mind, the only 2.4Ghz devices I have are smart plugs, sensors and other IOT devices which don't require bandwidth BUT they do need stability, which the ASUS provides.\n\nRange:\nThe ASUS range is MUCH better than the Netgear on both 2.4 and 5 Ghz.  The Netgear would have barely any signal while I'm in the garage (furthest point from the router).  The ASUS has a Good signal and even has signal when sitting in the car in my driveway, outside of the garage, which is much further from the router.  Our entire backyard has good signal.  We considered using AI mesh but now I don't think it's even necessary.\n\nGaming:\nNot sure what gaming mode adds but I tested ping times to a game server.  With a wired connection, it is a solid 15-20ms.  With wifi6 wireless laptop 2 rooms away, it is still 15-20ms.  But turning gaming mode off still gave us the same ping, so not sure what it actually enhances or not.\n\nInterface:\nThe ASUS web interface and android app is miles ahead of Netgear.  The Netgear web interface looks like an old ASP web app without even the full set of options available.  The ASUS android app is very clean and easy to use and has all the \"most used options\" only a button click away.  They obviously have done usability studies.  The Netgear app looks much better than their web interface but takes forever to connect to the router.\n\nConclusion:\nThe ASUS AX5400 is a much better router than the Netgear AX5400.  I don't know if Netgear's firmware need more work or whatever but the comparison isn't even close, in my opinion.",

It was given a new modem as well. My old equipment was over 10 years old at the time that I upgraded, but this new router seems to be amazing. The best way I can tell is how far it reaches out into my yard even though it is not a mesh network, my coverage seems to have doubled in distance. My speeds are off the charts fast now, and again that may have to do with switching services and the new modem as well, but I am very happy with this router, and I would buy again and recommend to my friends and family. If you were in the market for a new router, you should consider buying this one as well. Important note: my house is roughly 1,700 square feet. If you live in a mansion, you may still want to use a mesh network, but for any small to large house, this one should meet all your needs. Plus, it pulses really cool colors and was insanely easy to set up.",

I would occasionally see that netflix to my tv would stop and the tv would say that there was no internet connection.  I kept blaming the tv or our ISP.  Then we got a video doorbell which uploaded continuous video and I was able to plainly see that multiple times a day this router would drop connections and there would be no uploaded video. I was able to pinpoint the router as the cause.  I tried resetting the router and setting up from scratch but that didn't help (yes it was at the latest firmware).  More searching showed that this is a very common experience from multiple people.  Search for \"ea8500 dropped connections\".

All up to date on the firmware. Excellent speedtest results when fresh off of a restart of the router (not modem related). This morning, wifi crawling and a speedtest clocked in at 5 Mbps. Unacceptable. Restart router and fresh test on multiple browsers clock in at 70+ Mbps. I cannot rely on a device that needs to be restarted every day.

It looks like some kind of big spider with long antenna arms sticking up in the air.\n\nFour months later and this router keeps randomly dropping my WIFI and direct connection to my Comcast Arris TG862-CT cable gateway.  I returned the last one that did the same thing and the replacement has started doing it.  I am running my Comcast Arris TG862 Cable Modem in bridge mode because it has terrible range.

                "review_body": "Been a Linksys user for many years.  My intention is not to bash them, but to warn others that this router has issues.  The first EA8500 purchased was DOA...powered up, but Ethernet ports didn't work.  Returned for another.  The second EA8500 took a few tries (and resets) to get it up and running.  Once up, the router worked like a router should...so I thought.  After a few days the router would disconnect, 2-3 times a day and the Linksys logo would just flash until I power cycled the router.  After a day or two of this, nothing I did (power cycle, reset, leave unplugged for a few minutes) could get the router to connect.  I finally gave up and reconnected my trusty EA6900 with no problem.  FYI...the EA8500 was updated with current firmware and setup with basic settings.",

Im roughly 3000 sq ft. and this cannot come close. An associate from Best Buy told me simple 2600 is not enough and the MU capabilities tax the router for devices on the border of its range that is probably causing the drops. This thing drops even when those \"borderline\" devices are not in direct use.\nThe initial setup with the administration console is not stable as well. Sometimes the linksyssmartwifi URL works or you have to hit 192.168.0.1 ( or 1.1 or the variant). Sometimes one works and the other doesnt. If you are not technical, dont bother.\nParental controls haven't blocked simple sites (google.com) I added for my son's devices so he can't google school answers. Not sure why, but don't care any more.\n\nPros:\nLinksys Customer Service was easy to work with.",

Now I can't go 30 minutes without a dropped connection.  I thought it was the computer's fault. I would have to reboot, sometimes two or three times, to get Wi-Fi back.  I didn't think it was the router at first because my iOS devices still had Wi-Fi.  But just as an experiment before returning the laptop I took out the AC2600 and reinstalled my old Linksys E4200; so far I have run 36+ hours without a dropped Wi-Fi connection.  I don't know what it is, but I suspect some incompatibility between the AC2600 and the Intel Wireless 8600 card.  I down loaded the latest wireless driver direct from Intel without any improvement, so I don't think it's a glitch in the driver that only the AC2600 picks up.  I would like to return the router but I am at 5 weeks after purchase and can't.  If you are running Windows 10 and have an Intel wireless card DO NOT BUY THIS ROUTER!!!",

I spent another 3.5hrs on the phone with Tech Support where they wanted to charge me for them to remote access to my computer (which I ended up not having to pay), after 90 minutes of them trying to get it to forward the ports and not working, they told me to send it back for a replacement.\n\nI am very weary about replacing this router with another one, but now I am curious if it is an issue with the one I bought or all of them...I just can't believe I'm the only one that port forwarding does not work!",

Took me a couple of days to decide to jump right in.  I COULD NOT BELIEVE HOW EASY IT WAS!  The Linksys interface is very good.  It took all of about 15 minutes start to finish.

(On a power strip and my gateway modem died as well) I hooked up the AC2600 and the first thing I noticed was it did not use industry standard IP addresses. This caused issues with items I have set up with static IP addresses. The range was half of what my extreme was. It would give me one bar on my patio (40 ft from router). Devices continued to drop off the router. I called their joke they call tech support. Its someone in the Philippines who can barely speak English and is reading off of a script. I asked how I could increase the Output strength like you could do on older Linksys models. You would think I was asking them how to launch a missile. When I asked for level II tech support because the person on the other line didn't have a clue I was put on hold they never came back on the line (10 min of waiting). I'm returning this POS. I turned on my AT&T 2 wire gateway WiFi and I have WiFi at the back of my yard 160 feet from the modem! I'm sure there are much better products out there.

But for this Linksys cookie my sweet expectations were met with bitter disappointment [as a side note I spent over 5 hours with different customer support teams, I am in college! I DO NOT have 5 hours to spend! Perhaps it could be justified if I thought my internet might be faster but then again, that requires a working router].

I assembled it, plugged it in, and set it up following the easily understood instruction, et voila, it worked.  No more spinning thing on my computer or tv while streaming. It is good!",

Great network control interface on smart phone through Linksys app (free).

Portions of the firmware simply have never worked (speed test), and the network map is an ABSOLUTE joke. More than half of my devices are listed as \"Network Device\" with no other identifying information. This makes troubleshooting an issue, especially on devices without screens such as IoT devices or a WiFi printer annoyingly difficult (these devices show up in a WiFi network map I can run on my Mac and on my old DD WRT firmware with names/additional information, so I know it's not the devices). I'm also noticing WiFi connectivity issues even when I'm in the same room with the router with a direct line of sight. Completely unacceptable!\n\nI decided this week that I was going to migrate to DD WRT and see if that helped to mitigate any of these issues and I learned that the firmware is locked and I am unable to downgrade or install custom firmware without opening the router up and using a USB-serial cable to telnet in.

I get 50 x 5 service at home, and was having issues everyday... got this router and immediate difference... I now get 62 x 7 in every part of my house on both 2.4 and 5G frequencies..  and it hasn't buffered yet... step son on his PS4, 6 year old on his iPad, and 19month streaming wheels on the bus on the chromecast and still getting my full speed... I am beyond impressed and didn't think this was ever possible... glad lynksys proved me wrong... highly recommended...",

I routinely access my home systems remotely using iPhones and iPads over a VPN and the Linksys AC2600 would not allow this.  I tried disabling the SPI firewall on this router and was able to connect to my VPN once.  After turning the firewall on and off several times I was never able to connect again using that method.  I tried turning off IPv6 on the router and was able to connect to my VPN once again.  After disconnecting I was never able to reconnect.  I am absolutely certain that my settings (port forwarding etc.) are correct because they are identical to my previous router.\n\nI contacted Linksys support and they told me I need to contact the VPN vendor.  I told them I can get it to work by reconnecting my old router but they insisted that I contact the VPN vendor.  When I pursued a better answer they hung up on me . . . a new all-time low for customer service for me.\n\nI have been a long-term Linksys/Cisco customer and have been generally happy with their products.  It is also easy for me to set them up because I have become so familiar with their user interface.

Perhaps this would have been the outcome from any wireless router, so I don't want to be too harsh in my review, but I found the best way to increase the coverage was to add another range extender to my network.\n\nDon't believe everything you read about router coverages.  If your coverage is not very good because of walls, steps, etc., you might be better off trying range extenders first.  They are about 20% of the cost of a new generation router, and will likely do you more good.",

For once a UI was written for someone who just wants to tweak a setting or two in a very obvious fashion i.e. mac filtering, wifi password setup etc.; the UI is a huge improvement.  Only on the initial startup did the router kind of hang, after resetting to factory I believe it was doing an update, my advice is to let the router just do an automatic setup (verses manual) then make changes after the router does it's initial setup.

After this router was set up, which took just a few minutes of configuration time,  I was very surprised to see that the router has a DLNA server built in.  I attached a USB drive with media on it to the router, and it worked flawlessly- my TV 'sees' the router as a DLNA server and I'm able to steam media off of the router to the TV.  Upgrading to the AC2600 not only provided a hefty performance boost over the old router, but also added in a DLNA streaming media server.",

I used it as a family router for ~4.5 years when a virus scan informed me that the router was potentially compromised. Unfortunately, Netgear had stopped supporting this router so I couldn't patch or update the router's firmware to resolve the issue. After some research on Amazon/CNET/Consumer Reports, I decided to purchase the Linksys AC2600 4 x 4 MU-MIMO Dual-Band Gigabit router from Amazon. Unfortunately, after installing it, upgrading the firmware, and operating it for a week it didn't meet our family's needs for three reasons: 1) intermittent loss of connectivity, 2) 12.5 Mbps download speed was much slower than w/ the aforementioned Netgear router, and 3) inadequate Parental Controls. Specifically, the Linksys Parental Controls only allow you to control connected device times while blocking up to 10 websites (e.g., Facebook). There is no option, like on the Netgear router, to leverage OpenDNS to filter out adware, alcohol, drugs, gambling, hate/discrimination, pornography, tasteless, phishing, web spam sites, etc. Therefore, after 12 days I replaced the Linksys router (unfortunately I can't return it for a refund or credit as the 1-month window passed) w/ a Netgear Nighthawk X4S AC2600 Smart WiFi Router and am loving it. Fwiw, our download speed has increased to 59.6 Mbps and we again have robust parental controls which protect our family via the Netgear Genie Parental Control application.",

                "review_body": "The reviews on this are very promising, but the router proved immune to being properly set up.  LinkSys has this new \"Smart WIFI\" system, which basically lets you manage your router through their cloud.  I can't be sure but that seems to be the source of my woes.\n\nI managed to get to the \"local login\" exactly ONCE.  After doing a lot of configuration, and being 80% happy (hadn't done my port forwarding yet, for example), I rebooted it.  From then on I could not get to the local login to administer the router.\n\nTo re-enter setup, you need to RESET THE ROUTER.  Completely.  Alas even the hardest of resets never got me back to the local login.\n\nThe admin UI is amazingly slow, possibly due to trying to communicate with the cloud.  I am used to slow router UIs.  This was exceptional.\n\nThe UI also has \"more information\" links that go to 404 pages on linksys.com.  Way to maintain, guys.  This is a new product, so no excuse for the firmware's url being old.\n\nLinksys support was OK.  Pleasant and professional in tone, of course.  Methodical - lots of resets and try this obvious thing, which I dutifully did, for three different support techs.  But it seemed like they had a different UI in front of them -- options were worded differently and in some cases completely missing.  It feels like this product is maybe too new, or too high end and rare, and has a poorly constructed support script.  Escalated support was not much more helpful.\n\nSummary: maybe if you don't ever set up anything on your router, it would work great out of the box.  Good luck if you need to configure it.  Any value this router might provide was locked away from me behind \"Smart WIFI\" and its cloud.",

As of June of 2017 the price you pay is comparable, on the expensive side, with other high end routers. Setup is easy, and performance is decent, but is not as good as advertised. This unit has what's called Max Stream family where in theory these units should talk to any other device that has Max Stream firmware. My goal was to use two of these devices one as main and second one as Access Point and they do not work as good as you would expect (similar to Mesh Whole House Wifi Systems). They do not communicate with other that well and do not transfer load evenly (meaning closest stationary device will move to the closest router). The seamless roaming does work well, but I am using a different manufacturer with the same setup and it's doing the load-sharing better. Linksys app has many bugs it required me to reboot the router multiple times to be able to access it remotely... customer support its a hit or miss since I asked many times the same questions and got different answers.",

Tonight signal on my wife's iPhone 4, my iPhone 5 and my Galaxy Note (brand new phone) was dropping wifi and picking back up. On off on off on off. It is defintely a programming or hardware issue. For links us to say that they don't know of any know issues is a BLATENT LIE. Do not buy this useless piece of junk unless you want to unplug it and plug it back in EVERY SINGLE DAY.\n\nI have had this Router since 12/07/15. It is now 2/10/16. About 3 weeks ago, our phones, 2 apple Iphones 4 and a 5 along with a Galaxy s4 Note drop wifi, on and off, on and off, on and off constantly. I have to unplug the router and plug it back in, and it works fine for a day. Then we are back to dropping and picking up. I have been on the phone with Linksys for 3 hours. The only solution was to change the channels, to the highest channel and \"hope\" that works. Also, the Support girl insisted that it was my cable modem dropping. Well Ms Tech support person, My lap top, printer and Mac STAY connected, as I sit here on my laptop and watch 3 phones, all from different generations pick up, connect and drop the wifi connection. I have been on the phone with amazon for 36:46 minutes for a replacement because I am 10 days out of the return window. Amazon was awesome. Just got off the phone... 45 minute phone call. They refunded me the original piece of junk, and are sending me a new one. HOPEFULLY, this one will not bounce in and out of connectivity for mobile devices. FYI, I just walked up the stairs to do my daily unplug, wait 30 seconds and replug in on this stupid router.... and well connectivity should be good for the next 24 hours.... or so.... HOPEFULLY.... I will update this review after getting the NEW one. LINKSYS, for 219.00 I EXPECTED MORE.....",

I upgrade every few years as tech changes, security evolves, etc. this router working great so far for my full time home office, ipad, streaming tv etc. Top tip for setup, connect via wired cable to desktop or notebook if possible. Go through setup, update firmware. Use the setup tool via your local router i.p. in web browser. Read instructions on the Linksys website. Make sure antennas fully screwed in. They should be pointed straight up. A quick setup card in more detail would have been nice, but at least the default password is on the setup card so you don\u2019t have to suffer turning over router to look for it. Upshot... don\u2019t try to do setup over wifi if you can\u2019t launch the setup tool. Worked from a wired connection flawlessly including prompts to change broadcast names, passwords for wpa2, and admin pass. If you can\u2019t see your new device name over wifi, you did it wrong. Comes with cable to connect to isp box and for initial wired setup. Happy so far.\n\nUPDATED- added photo connected to FIOS router.",

                "review_body": "Read a few good reviews on performance of this router before buying, and Amazon's price looked good, so I gave it a try. But came away extremely disappointed.\n\nFirst disappointment--it requires an internet connection to configure--can't manually configure it offline, then swap it in place of an existing router.\n\nSecond disappointment--the configuration process didn't work as advertised. Router connected to my cable modem, and appeared to connect to the linksys website, but would drop the connection whenever I attempted to create an account or even read the terms and conditions. And the \"manual configuration\" and \"re-flash\" options described in Linksys support site didn't work at all.\n\nThird disappointment--speed during the configuration process was visibly slower than my old TP-Link 300 Mbps router that this was to replace. Using a wired connection was a bit faster than wireless, but I think both were still slower than my old wireless. And this was with only one client connected to the router, just visiting the config website.\n\nFourth and final disappointment--the privacy terms of Linksys' shrinkwrap license are, in my opinion, onerous. According to the privacy statement, Linksys / Belkin will collect \"Usage data about how and when you use Belkin Products, other devices that are connected to Belkin Products and what features of Belkin Products you use. Technical information and data gathered when your Belkin Products are connected to the Internet, such as how many and which devices are connected to your home network, when you use the devices and the amount of network traffic generated. We also collect environmental data when you use certain Belkin Products, such as utility settings, temperature and light readings in the home, motion detection and alarm events.\" No doubt all of this is connected to the forced configuration through Linksys smartwifi servers. I just want a fast, reliable router (and this EA8500 failed to convince me it was one). I don't see any benefit to providing this information to Linksys / Belkin, and don't want them snooping my home network in this fashion.",

However, I\u2019ve work through setting up enough home networks to understand how to configure dual band (and have dabbled in the past with bridging, cable vs DSL configs, etc.)  When our last router (an ASUS (RT-AC68U) died after only one year (let\u2019s just say the dog accidently caused it to come crashing to the floor), I did the research and settled on the Linksys AC2600.\n\n Setup was the easiest I have ever seen with a router and we were off and running in about 10min (after the firmware update).  Speeds jumped from the 9mps our deathbed ASUS was giving us to 58mps 2 rooms over!  Then, one and a half weeks later, my wife and kids (I was out of town\u2026Murphy\u2019s Law) woke to no WiFi.  Upon further research, the wife determined that the internet signal through the modem was fine so it had to be the router.  Standard restarts did nothing.  Then, after 1.5hrs on the phone troubleshooting with Linksys, they concluded they couldn\u2019t determine the issue and she should send it back.\n\n So, she set up the return and ordered another one assuming it was a fluke.  The new one arrived\u2026she went through the setup process and\u2026nothing.  Another 1.5hrs with tech support and again no resolution.  Our provider Suddenlink said everything looked good on their end (which was confirmed through direct connection with the modem) and our ARRIS/Motorola SurfBoard SB6141 modem continues to work like a champ.  So, now the 2nd router is going back too and frankly I\u2019m done with the brand for a while.  It seems to me Linksys has jumped to release some cutting edge technology before really wringing it out and educating their tech support.  I suppose it\u2019s the risk you take when riding the cutting edge\u2026\n\nUpdate: (14Jul15)  After returning both routers, I purchased the ASUS RT-AC87U instead.  Setup was a breeze and it worked right away; further proof that the issue was the Linksys and not the user.",

                "review_body": "In all seriousness this is the worst router I have ever owned since routers have been in use for home networking for a couple of reasons. Starting with the good though is does have a good signal both in clarity and range and considering I have literally 50 devices  running through it it handles the traffic pretty decent, which the range with clarity so far are the best that I have had. Now for the negative which the most irritating of all is the Linksys smart Wi-Fi connection not connecting, now for me for over 2 weeks straight. This means that I cannot log into the router to verify or change anything at all. I cannot login because the connect program says there is no internet access, which since I am doing this review through that connection means my internet service must be magical. The help says you can login locally as admin but so far that is  impossible as that is not even an option. The other horrible thing is in the menu system, if you do happen to be able to get to it. When you go to look at the devices that are available you don't get a list with basic information but icons of the various devices which you have to click on individually to bring up the information. Don't know who approved that but they should have been fired. Face most people who go into there device listings to see what's going on don't care about a pretty layout they want information. My most previous router was an ASUS and I hate throwing this much money away but I may have to and go back to an ASUS or something else just so I can get into the thing to work on the network settings.",

This now has the same issue of dropping one or both bands at random and requires a hard restart.  The warranty is one year.  The unit began frequent problems at 14 months.  Linksys text support is horrible, takes too long to troubleshoot.  Linksys phone support strung me along for 15 minutes then went into a sales pitch to pay for service to troubleshoot or offer support.  They blamed any factor other than the router.  It was similar to one of those credit card scam calls.  I work in the IT field and half of what they mentioned was irrelevant and used to scare people into paying a high one time fee.  I am not saying linksys makes low quality products generally.  I buy a lot of their high end Cisco products.  But their home products are lacking in support and I would be cautious and buy an inexpensive Amazon offered long term extended warranty.  Then you can just send it back and get a new one.  I usually do and have no idea why I did not with this, it may not have been offered in checkout.",

The result are \"dead\" or weak zones in many places - so the farther one moves away from the router the more likely we will drop a signal.  After careful research, and a consult with my nephew-in-law, who owns a computer repair business, we chose this unit.  After downloading and reading the directions I was able to add this device as essentially an extender for our existing router.  Within 15 minutes it was up and running.  Our existing router operated at an average of 75 mps - this router operates at about 183 mps.  It reaches the dead zones and is operating flawlessly.  We understand how frustrating it can be to install one of these things, especially if you are like me, not very computer savvy: take your time and review all the instructions and it will work for you too.  We are very happy that we can now stream data in places that were unresponsive previously.  Excellent product.  PS - you do need to attach it, initially, to a laptop or PC, to get it up and running.  So bear that in mind.",

No dropouts, no buffering.\n\nSpecs of most units now exceed Internet subscription feed speeds, so chosen specifically for having 4x4 MU MIMO.

You can pay far more for speed (you can't use) but still only get 3x3 if you don't check the more obscure specs.  You don't want your IOT wall thermostat determining Netflix's bit rate.\n\nNot worth a star subtraction as it flat-out works, but would prefer to set the modem up locally vs. requiring the Internet and utilizing Linksys' cloud services.  Yes, I can now reconfigure the router remotely even if I were in China, yet how often does one configure their home network while away?  Never.  Or even modify it once configured?  Never.

Much buffering and then simply stopped streaming.\nI decided to move the router up from the basement onto the main floor of my house.  That greatly helped. No more buffering, but shows load slowly.\nStill, speed is worse than expected.\nI pay US Internet for 100mbps, and I get slightly faster than that.

I have used both the mobile app and the router's admin functions - both provide incredibly detailed information and options but now it's even easier to set up. On my previous router, I had to change the subnet mask just to get a static IP to work for my IP printer. Now, it is automatic. And I can rename any device, check status, history, and block in a few clicks!\n\nAnd best of all, I didn't have to create a Linksys account just to manage anything. They do push you to create one, but you can use almost every feature without it. I did a fully manual setup and manually manage the network from my browser or the iPhone app. However, if I would make a Linksys account, I would be able to do all of that, plus pull files from the NAS while remote.

Linksys does rank high from my past experiences, but these days a lot of others (Netgear, TP-Link, Asus) have really cleaned up their act.  My household has multiple high demand applications; many devices, online gaming, Steamlink, etc.  We were previously using a D-Link unit that was showing it's age when demand was high, and reliability issues were getting tiring.  During Prime Day this was purchased and we couldn't be more pleased.  The my Steamlink is actually usable now, and no more drops in connection.  The menu and settings for this router is plentiful and straightforward.  I am enjoying the little extra features; guest passwords that limits their access, being able to see who's on, how much, at any time.  I may not be using the super advanced features some others are having problems with, but for high demand home networking and internet, I haven't run into any issues... except for the wall mounting.  The cables exit the top, not the most optimal layout for wallmounting, but it cant justify a star drop for that.\n\nTIP: Don't bother with the accompanied CD.  Hardwire a laptop to the router, go to 192.168.1.1, and go through the step by step process.  If your wireless doesn't go on from the start; turn it on.

I recently purchased a max spec Dell XPS 15 with Wireless AC, but with my (very reliable) Linksys EA4500 Wireless-N router I was only getting 30-40 Mbps at my home office desk. The weak link was the router so I pre-ordered the EA8500, which arrived today. After a couple of restarts and resets and a firmware upgrade I was up and running. My first bandwidth test showed 360 Mbps at my desk, i.e. 9x faster than my old router! I could probably do better with a better router location.  My iPhone 6 registered 165 Mbps download held within 6 ft of the router.\n\nMaybe I could get the same performance with any AC router, but I chose this state of the art unit so that it will be compatible with future wireless devices that exploit more of its capability.\n\nIn practical terms, I get very fast page loads, no video buffering and smooth 4K video performance. Everything runs faster and smoother.\n\nIf Linksys had shipped the EA8500 with working firmware, which I assume will happen shortly, I would give it 5 stars. The setup instructions are simple, and despite the unit's advanced capability the software interface is great and it is easy to configure.",

Even as an it guy who knows how to set up a \"real\"  router,  I would recommend following the automated idiot steps.\n\nI did have to reset it to get it to do what it should have out of the box.... Will have to update the review after I use it.... My old tplink was having issues with dhcp and performance but hey it cost $49 I am expecting more from this expensive box.\n\nUPDATE:  So despite an install that required resets (not a big deal just annoying) this router is kicking butt.  I know most people will focus on download speeds while at home and that has improved greatly with this router. But my biggest issue has been streaming from my sling box to my laptop or ipad or phone.  This of course is not just dependent on my home network, but the connection in the office, hotel or where ever I am....BUT since swapping out my $49 TPLink with this expensive home router, my experience has gone from OK to wow it's like watching TV right from the satellite receiver.\n\nI think even an educated novice can overcome the install headaches - some better than others - and the results will be worth it. I am thinking some of the negative reviews here are due to other factors (in terms of performance).  Again I would recommend, that you follow the wizard for initial install and if you are router/IT savvy go back and manually change things after the fact.",

The options for private and public were easy to navigate.\n My extended family with their seven phones, five iPads, and four computers had no trouble connecting and getting the band width they needed.\nThen the bottom dropped out. It just stopped working. After several calls to Linksys, talking with very responsive technicians with thorough diagnostic analysis, they agreed to send a new machine. It would be the next up in the series and would arrive in two days. They said they would call in the morning to arrange for delivery. That night, I went back to two previous routers (a netgear and a linksys that didn't have the range, but would give options near by.\nThey no longer worked. That left my internet provider as the culprit. Before I could call the local provider, a new linksys tech called. She went through a different set of diagnostic protocols. Still didn't work. Before she arranged for the new router. I asked for her direct line and time to call the ISP. The ISP claimed it couldn't be them. I suggested they reset our system. No response from the tech there. He suggested setting a new port on the router. I said I would try. Before I did anything though, the router came alive. I tried the older two. They came alive. I think it was the ISP, and they wouldn't admit it.\nThe router gives good range, 50 user capacity, and good tech support. I would buy this router again.",

I thought it was my provider but they came and checked everything and proved that over 100 Mbps was flowing directly out of the modem to my laptop. I hooked the router back up and it dropped to around 60 Mbps on ethernet. I tried different cables and ports and it didn\u2019t improve. I called Linksys tech support and they spent 2 hours walking me through a lot of settings and changes. It got back up to the high 80's but that was it. Also, the Network map doesn't show my devices properly. It shows some twice and some with the wrong connection type (ethernet vs. Wifi). Today I can't even log into it via the android phone app or the typical UI.  I do not recommend this router. I hope I can still send it back. I am totally dissatisfied. I guess they just aren't as good as they were under Cisco!\n\nJust discovered I'm too late to return it to Amazon. Oh well, $175 pretty much wasted. I have various devices running on ethernet  but even with all those disconnected the speed did not improve. The WiFi works pretty well but the 5 Ghz range isn't great.\n\nUpdate 7/6/17: FINALLY my ISP fixed the line and my Internet is back up to speed and finally consistent. Therefore the ethernet ports on the router are back up to speed! This Linksys is great again! All the problems were caused by the ISP.",

Watched a cnet review by Dong Ngo and was convinced to get this one and very glad i chose it. Setup was a breeze. I did not choose manual setup I let the router do its work and i was back up and running in less than 10 minutes with no issues. So i'm honestly not sure how anyone is having trouble setting this up. It literally did everything itself including updates. All i had to do was name my connection and input desired password, that was literally the hardest part. I now currently have 2 desktop computers hardwired to it as well as 2 more computers using wireless along with 3 smartphones and my ps4 and wiiu. Everyone is connected with extremely fast connection and NO LAG. Completely worth the money.\n\nUpdate 2018:\n\nI thought I would do another update. I bought this router in 2015. It is now 2018, I bought a new house and brought it with me. It is still going strong. I now have a 4 bedroom house which is much bigger than where I lived previously and I get full coverage throughout without the need for range extenders. My internet speed here is also MUCH faster than I had before and this handles it with no problems. Great buy and if it suddenly decided to die on me today I would gladly buy another. I have had zero issues with this router in 3 years and it's still going. I'd give 10 stars at this point if I could.",

                "review_body": "I would have given it 5 stars but found I needed to contact Linksys support. My wifi was slow just using the defaults. Optimizing was not intuitive or automatic. I had to spend 3 hours online with Linksys support to get the correct settings. Would have not figured it out on my own. My wifi is faster now (around (50 MB/s) out of a max 100 MB/s coming in from the modem. Not sure if the speed is expected to be cut in half when coming through wifi but I was only getting 2 MB/s through the defaults before. So 50 MB/s out of 100 MB/s is much better than 2 MB/s. Funny thing is when I connect through an ethernet cable (cat 5e) it drops to 20 MB/s. You'd expect that to be even faster. So something is still a little hokey there. Will have to contact Linksys support again to see if that can be resolved. But I dread spending what may be another 3 hours online. But on the plus side, the representative I chatted online with was polite and patient throughout the entire ordeal. No complaints. Just the the time I had to spend resolving the wifi issue that I regret. My recommendation is if you're having an issue and just want to return it, maybe spend the time and contact Linksys support first. If it doesn't get resolved there, then return it.",

Any product that does an EPIC FAIL in such a short period of time should be able to be returned!\nNov 7, 2016\nI must amend my review...long overdue. I had a very favorable interaction with Linksys and they ended up replacing the router at no cost to me. They were very timely in helping and seemed concerned about the electrical short. I have had the replacement router for three months now and it works like a champ. Great range, very reliable. I changed from one star to four. Why not five? I am still not that happy about the cost relative to the range. I have a long house and have to use an extender. Also the toggling between 5 GHZ and 2.4 GHZ can be frustrating...the 5 GHZ has a very short reach. Seems typical for router capabilities.",

                "review_body": "My opinion would be to try another brand not owned by Belkin.  I don't usually write reviews but this router has been nothing but a headache.  I have had two older Linksys routers that were more than 5 years old and those were solid routers but I wanted an upgrade that included 802.11ac so I purchased this router.  I bought this directly from Amazon and did not receive it free.\n\nI am an experienced IT developer and professional for about 8 years now so setting up the router and other functionalities like port forwarding was easy.  I have had this router for about 5 months now.  I don't mind the user interface as I couldn't find anything negative about it.  When it is working, it is great.  The range is excellent.  My streaming media device on the first floor gets a much better signal from this router than it did from my older Linksys router.\n\nLike other reviews, I have had many drop connections.  My Winkhub and Honeywell Wifi thermostat would constantly lose Wifi connection to the router at the same time.  I would have to restart the router for both to connect again.  This did not happen with my older Linksys router!  Also, my other devices like my Galaxy Note 4 would drop the 5ghz Wifi connection and would not be able to find the 5ghz network anymore as it was not visible to the phone.  Drop connections are occurring on both the 2.4ghz and 5ghz band as I have devices on both bands.  I can't compare a 5ghz connection to my older Linksys router because it obviously does not have that band, but all my devices connected to 2.4ghz band on 802.11b on the older Linksys router worked fine and never had dropped connections.  I have restore default settings and flashed the firmware to no avail on this router.\n\nIn conclusion, if this router did not have so many issues, I think it would be a near 5 star router.  It is solid when it works but at this moment, the headache of drop connections is just not worth the price.  I constantly get updates on my email that my home automation devices have lost connection.  This disables me from controlling my devices remotely and it is annoying.  I have to restart my router at least once per day for my devices to not experience any wireless connection issues.  My old Linksys routers were solid and I rarely had to restart or touch those routers.  From now on, I think I will try another brand.\n\nNote: edited post to correct grammar.",

                "review_body": "Well, I got this router last year holiday season for $90. I thought AC2600 for $90 in 2016 was a great deal. But wait, it wasn't.  You get only what you pay for. I cannot return it now, past the window. Here is my honest experience from one year.\n1. Drops Connections internally frequently. This is not at all acceptable to remote work logins via VPN passthru. The corporate networks require stable connections which lasts 24 hrs at a stretch to build a VPN tunnel. If you drop and reconnect internet connection even for a 1/2 sec, everything on VPN is immediately lost. Most networks are built that way to secure their networks. This router fails the test completely.  Most consumer users do not notice this because it doesn't matter when streaming, reading a file etc.\n2. Relative signal strength is marginally higher compared to TP LINK. 5% more. Any consumer router cannot have more than 1Watt power by regulation. So all these claims that it is powerful is all bogus. TP-LINK AC1200 which is slower than this, fares much better; as good a signal strength as this.\n3. All the claims of this router is just marketing huff. Within 1W, you can only increase bands, raise the speed of bands, but you can't make it big, they have to play within the limits. So this all more marketing stuff confusing the consumer and trying to win among competitors. Whoever makes more noise will get noticed.\n4. The beam forming is not useful for VPN  passthru. It keeps changing the signal strength at a place and connections are lost. Old technology was better than this.\n5. They have nice APP interface to router; you can enable/disable guest networks on the fly via your phone. Most routers give it now a days. Very easy setup. Very catchy and impressive APP. What is the use of all this nice features when the product does not work ?\n6. Reliability:  Very poor for remote logon to corporate work. Kind of okay for consumer use. Even lower priced and lower band AC1200 routers such as TPLINK AC1200, fare much better than this. Changing channels did not solve the problem. There is some serious issue with software inside, it keeps dropping somehow, trying to do some 'Hitech' thing.\n7. SPEED:  Worse than lower technologies. I did a test comparison with TPLINK AC1200. Place routers at the same location, measure the signal strength at a fixed same location for each router. Speed on 2.4GHz band on Linksys router is 54 Mbps. TPlink AC1200 at the same spot as Linksys, gives 85 Mbps. On 5 Ghz band, TPLink goes 115 Mpbs! Linksys never even connects well on  5Ghz band. So where is the gain with AC2600 ?\n\nYears back I had another Linksys 802.11g old technology router, outdated today. I remember that one fried after 1-2 years use. Same experience again. I think this company is more marketing dust than reality. I will not venture into buying another Linksys in future.",

                "review_body": "This has been a great router. The range increase over the old is very noticeable. I've never gotten the speeds at these ranges on either ac or n . I'm deducting one star for 2 reasons. 1st, I don't think the qos feature works. Maybe its prioritizing some other type of traffic behind the scenes, but the way it does it is very strange to me. It seems to by default limit everyone to 15mbps when you enable qos. Then you can add high priority users to a list and they should get higher performance. In my testing with http speed tests, they did not get higher performance. But everyone was successfully limited regardless. So the feature was doing something, but I didn't like how it slowed down everyone regardless of the current usage. Qos is just disabled now and I'm fine with that. The other issue is with ac. This device will not allow you to explicitly set 5ghz band as ac only. In fact, the only way to get ac is to keep it at mixed mode, which allows in n/a/and ac. I don't understand this logic. I should be able to force ac mode on the 5ghz radios. I can confirm ac speeds are great, but it's a little crawl in my hide that another device could hop on the 5ghz band and associate as n. This would take away much of the speed benefits from that band from the ac capable clients. The fix is to only associate ac capable devices with this band. But this is not something I want to have to worry with. I would rather devices pick their best signal and radio, but setting it up this way could slow you down. So best to just keep the ssid's separate and pick the one you want per device.",

                "review_body": "I had high hopes for this router as it got rave reviews by Consumer Reports and CNET. I was willing to pay the seemingly excessive price as the MU-MIMO technology is kind of new and somewhat limited to certain routers. Shortly (a few days I believe) after installing my EA8500 some of my devices that had to connect to the 2.4 GHz network would lose their internet connectivity although they would still see and sometimes say they were still connected to said network. So, like most of us, I would reboot the router and/or modem (Motorola SB6141) and try again. This had worked the first three times I had to do it but tonight the router just kept flashing white. I plugged a device directly into my modem to verify at least THAT was working properly and, sure enough, it was. After messing with it for 30 minutes I got my old WRT54G and plugged that back in until I find a new replacement. I will say that the EA8500 was super easy to set up and had excellent signal strength but these lock ups or whatever they are just are unacceptable. I've requested a replacement but I'm thinking that I'm not going to have much more luck with the replacement router and that I'll be asking for a full refund in the near future.\n\n2/29/2016 - I received my replacement router after returning the first one. So far I've not had any issues with it dropping communication with my modem. I do still, however, have an issue with the entry-level Samsung BD player we have in our bedroom losing its connection with the 2.4 GHz network. I've been able to successfully connect the BD player to the network several times but it keeps acting like it was never connected before. What I've had to do is turn off the wireless at the router, turn it back on, and then re-connect the BD player to the network (I've tried both manually entering the network password and using the WPS feature). All other devices connected to the router on both the 2.4 GHz and 5.0 GHz networks have not had any issues. I'm thinking that this may be an issue with the BD players weak antenna or something in its software/firmware that keeps causing it to \"forget\" the network password, as was suggested by certain users on a different forum. I'll provide more details on they become available.\n\n3/10/2016 - Up to its old tricks again. Tonight the router dropped its connection with my modem. I tried resetting everything and continued to get the pulsing white light on the router. Since this was exactly the indication I got with the first router I decided to just give up and return the darn thing for a full refund (minus my time and effort trying to get a brand-new, fairly expensive product to work properly, silly me). My trusty old WRT54G is back in action and proud to serve after many years of faithful data transmission. The reason for the two-star rating vice one-star is that when it's working, it's a fabulous router. The linksyssmartwifi interface and great and I love the dual-band capability. As for the lofty review this router was given by a leading consumer product publication.. idk, maybe they just have better luck than me.",

Everyday I had to reboot it and eventually it just bogged down to the point where it would hardly transfer data over WiFi. Also, the router would not cover my 1500 SF house\n\nThis Linsys router is no joke. It is freaking awesome! Not only does it cover my whole house with full bars, it works out to the street. It is a dual band with both a 2.4GHz and 5GHz WiFI at the same time. It is streaming fast without any hiccups so far.\n\nAnother bonus was the router software. Its intuitive and easy to understand and setup. Also there is a simple digital WPS button on the software so I can set up new hardware in my house like a printer, then log into the router on my phone and hit WPS and they will connect. No more running across my house to hit the WPS button on the router. (This router also has a hardware WPS button too).",

                "review_body": "After a very careful consideration of all available options, I shortlisted the following routers (all within the same price range):\n- Netgear Nighthawk AC1900\n- Amped ATHENA AC2600\n- Linksys WRT AC1900\n- Linksys AC2600\n\nThey are all very powerful and it was difficult to make a final choice. I was leaning towards Linksys WRT AC1900 just because of its awesome look (check it out!) but I decided to go for a slightly more powerful Linksys AC2600. Since many of you will have a similar dilemma when choosing a router, I thought it might be helpful if I share the rationale behind my decision:\n\n- Linksys AC2600 has very good reviews in every source I looked at: it is either in top 3, 5 or 10 lists in every reputable tech websites (and even called the best router of 2017 on cheatsheet website)\n- It is one of the newest routers.\n- It is recommended for future technologies.\n- It is offered at a good discount on Amazon.\n\nThe other reasons are of course MI-MUMO technology, the router is designed for the speeds 50Mbps and up, it can be used for 12 and more devices at home (we have a very heavy traffic), a transmission rate for 5 GHz, and parental control for any device that you choose.\n\nNow, let's get to the feedback after the actual purchase:\n\n- The setup actually took 5 minutes! It is very quick and straightforward. Of course, you will need to choose a new WiFi for every device in your home. That will take a minute or less per device.\n- I couldn't believe my eyes when I ran the tests on the speed. See the photos. The old router (Netgear) gave me a download speed of 25 Mbps, the new router with 2.4 GHz - 42.14 Mbps and with 5 GHZ - 89.60 Mbps! Btw, it later went to 90+ I didn't even know that Comcast has upgraded my 50Mbps speed!\n- Then, I decided to test if it works at our neighbor's house. It automatically changed to 2.4 GHz but I still had 25Mbps. Pretty good considering the distance.\n- Before this router, we had problems on the weekends. The traffic was heavy and our older router couldn't cope with it. Not a problem anymore.\n- Most modern devices (including Roku 3/4) work with 5 GHz so you will enjoy a really nice and high speed of Internet. But even devices that don't support 5 GHz (e.g Playstation 3/4) have a very decent speed, actually, I can't even tell the difference when streaming/playing online.\n\nI think I made the right decision. I mean, it is still pricey, compared to $90 routers but if it continues to perform at these standards, I don't mind paying a hefty price tag. Heck, there are much more expensive routers out there that I didn't even consider. I just selected the one that seems to be reasonable for our needs.\n\nIf you have any questions, I will be happy to answer them.",

I had never gone to that settings link--it was set automatically.\n\nI called Linksys support and they started with all the standard questions.  I was on hold while they patched me over to an EA8500 specialist since it was a new device.  While on hold, I was looking at all the settings and noticed this Downstream Bandwidth was set at what I noticed I was limited at on all my devices--prioritized or not.  I changed the speed to 80 Mbs and voila, all my devices cruised along at 50 Mbs or greater (the limit of my paid service).  The agent came on the line and told me the default value of this was supposed to be zero, which kept the Downstream Bandwidth from being limited at all.  I never touched this setting up to this support call, but changed it to zero and still had my cable modem limited max speed.  The support agent didn't seem to think it was a problem that this value was set/changed behind the scene with no input from me.  Later, I researched the issue and found many others had the same problem.  So....if you find your speeds are limited, go to Media Prioritization, click the settings link and make sure Downstream Bandwidth is set to zero.\n\nNow, to my next problem.  After about a week, my router started freezing up.  The front panel Linksys logo which when illuminated steady indicates proper operation, was dark and the back indicator lights were all out except the Wireless protected setup and wireless output lights were on steady green.  I reset the power switch on the back of the router, the logo came on blinking and then steady like it should and I would be back to normal LAN and wireless operation.  Then over the next few days, about every 24 hours the same thing would happen--a freeze up and loss of all connectivity.  Support decided to send me out a new router.\n\nThat new EA8500 router took 5 days to arrive.  Out of the box it didn't work!  I knew how to set it up from my first experience.  This time, my internet input and LAN output connections showed proper green and yellow lights for connectivity and data flow, my wireless output light on the back was steady green like it should be, and the logo on the front was steady.  All looked normal, but no wireless signal.  I reset it several times with the reset button in the back, saw the correct reset light blink flow, but no help.  Tried multiple power resets, still no help.  Nothing on-line or in troubleshooting section helped.  Afterhours for support, but I'm just sending it back.\n\nI'm swapping out my old one that at least worked but freezes each day with the Amazon return.  If this 3rd one doesn't work right, I'll update my rating to one star and move on to a different router.  Too bad it looks like this new offering from Linksys isn't quite ready for prime time.",

BUT let me share my setup experience in hopes of helping anyone else who is as forgetful as me!\n\nAfter opening the box I first read the short (2 pages!) setup pamphlet, then followed the steps. I disconnected my old router (I have no modem). Connected this router, connected my laptop to the default network specified in the pamphlet, and went to the website. Changed the network name and set its password. Then I started connecting my devices to the new network. MacBook 1, already done. MacBook 2, check... and that's when I first noticed that my old network was still listed as a choice of networks to which I could connect. But not all my devices had been added to the new network (still specified the old one), so I continued. iPhone, iPad, check. Printer, check. Wireless speakers, check. Botvac, check. Video streaming devices (Fire stick, Apple TV), check. DirecTV, check. Thought I was done... but my old network was still showing up as available. Hmmm.\n\nLater that day, I discovered that DirecTV refused to let me stream On Demand video. It said to Test (the Internet) Connection, but when I did, no problem was found - It said it was connected. But it still wouldn't stream and would take me back to Test Connection each time.. After a handful of tries, I reset the network settings and put my new network  back in. Same result. I reset the box, entered network info (my old one was still showing up as an option). Still no. Called DirecTV/AT&T support and they had me do the same steps I'd already tried. Still no.\n\nI could go on but I'll cut to the solution that I finally discovered on my own. While busy with all my other devices, I'd forgotten to go into my AIRPORT TIME CAPSULE, to change its network settings. It's so obsequious I forgot all about it even though I had physically connected it to the new router. As soon as I changed it, my old network was no longer listed as an option on any of my devices and DirecTV On Demand worked. Somehow DirecTV was connecting to my new network but there was a \"ghost\" of my old network interfering through Time Capsule. Once it was gone, no more problems.\n\nSo I redirected my frustration from Linksys and DirecTV to where it belonged. Me.",

                "review_body": "I don't usually write negative reviews, in fact I just prefer to not leave feedback, however I wanted to tell my story for anyone thinking of purchasing this device.\n\n*****I am a Information Security Manager working in the industry for almost 15 years now.  I have owned my own wireless modems and routers as long as I can remember*****\n\n- One thing to be wary of is the initial setup is titled \"Linksys Smart-wifi\" yet you have to directly connect to the device via the included patch cable to complete initial configuration *sigh*.\n\nI purchased this device on June 8, 2015 directly from Amazon.  Within the first month I experienced several complete drop-outs where the router lost internet connectivity and had to be reset.  I also experienced an issue where my download speed dropped to 0.50 MB while upload remained around 12 MB.  I first called the cable company suspecting a problem with my modem. After connecting my laptop directly to my Motorola Surfboard modem, I was again receiving 120 MB download speeds.\n\nNext, I contacted Linksys (Belkin) customer support and spent over an hour on the phone troubleshooting the device.  We tried everything from resetting the router multiple times with a paper clip, re-flashing the firmware, rolling back the firmware, to MAC address clone and the device would just not hold the configuration.  So after arguing with the customer support representative how I should not have to pay for return shipping on a defective item, I finally had them agree to email a pre-paid shipping label.  They placed a $400 hold on my credit card until the defective item was received.\n\nLast week I received the RMA replacement device and loaded my saved configuration.  On 08/18 I once again had to reset the router when it stopped responding right in the middle of playing a game on Xbox Live.  On 08/20 again my download speed dropped to 0.5 MB and I finally gave up and decided to hookup my old TP-Link router.\n\nInstead of calling Linksys (Belkin) back today, I decide to contact Amazon directly even though the 30 day return period has passed.  The customer service representative was excellent and promptly emailed me a pre-paid shipping label.  Tomorrow this POS is getting shipped back to Amazon via UPS and I will have my money back in a few days.  I don't know if there is compatibility issues with Motorola modems, Time Warner cable, or what, but I do know I'm not the first person to experience these issues.  I will never buy another Linksys product again after this experience.\n\nRIP to my old WRT54G, however those days of a rock solid product from Linksys are long gone!!\n\nEDIT: I have long since replaced this defective router with an ASUS RT87U and am very pleased.  Excellent speed and range and never have I experienced any drop-outs or loss of configuration.",

Outstanding.\n2) After 45+ days using the new router, my reboots have been limited to 1 - 2 max!!\n3) After replacing the initial Router (which most likely had hardware defects), the Replacement Wireless Router appears to be successfully managing our 21 wireless devices running throughout the household. As such, I believe the MIMO is now working as advertised, which is awesome!\n\n**Update** not only does this require frequent reboot but I have had to complete entire factory reset (and that doesn't always work). Customer service chat was useless. On my 3rd and final factory reset, I gave up & attempted to return but released I am 5 days over return availability and now I'm stuck with this piece.\n---------------------------------\nSetup was very easy and rather intuitive, and everything was good, BUT just like another reviewer, the AC8500 worked great for the first few days; however it eventually stopped transmitting a WiFi signal.  I am able to use the Ethernet ports, but no WiFi....hence no Smart WiFi app access. I restarted, unplugged, and even reset to factory with no success.  I am currently chatting with support....we'll see if it can be quickly resolved.",

                "review_body": "I'm a long term Linksys fan - have had every version of 802.11 routers from them over several years with no probs. After reading about how Netgear routers have a software vulnerability since August of 2016 that still hasn't been fully addressed, I saw no reason to change when my ISP recommended I upgrade my old G router to increase my speed. I overbought somewhat to protect against obsolescence and keep my bandwidth consistent. The AC is awesome, different devices can find the best network (2.4 or 5ghz) and my Firestick loads faster now than it used to. The best part is that guests have their own sub network to sign onto, so no one has access to the main protected network which controls all the functions and security of the router. Much easier app to access the router from a PC also, the user interface has been simplified and isn't as much of a geekfest trying to figure out all the controls and options. Your devices can also be prioritized (for example, to give a Firestick first dibs on bandwidth) on the router. Awesome product, highly recommend. This should easily be able to handle the demands of a home based business or multiple users with multiple devices. Any upgrade from this would be for a professional level router with massive bandwidth that very few people would ever need for home use. I have to give Linksys customer support mad props too - I called with some questions early on to make sure I fully understood the router as I was unfamiliar with the new tech it has & found out a year of free total tech support comes with the router. I wish support for my Dell was half as good - these calls weren't going to India and the tech folks were fully up to speed and gave me the same story & showed the same level of expertise every time I got on the horn. Absolutely a Linksys groupie for life, every router I buy gets better and works flawlessly. Kudos.",

                "review_body": "Edit 1:\nThis EA8500 is one month old and still stable as a rock, super fast speeds, no dead wifi spots at all like most other routers form other manufactures.\n I found the system info page that tells us what connection rate and a hole lot more\nYou just refresh it to get an update, not as fancy as other router brands but it does show more than any GUI in other routers.\n\nhttp://192.168.1.1/sysinfo.cgi\n\nA little background, I had d-link, Netgear, apple, all were good except for Netgear had to reboot weekly to monthly, then RT-AC66R - this was a good Asus router, I had the RT-AC68R - this was good at 2.4GHz but 5GHz sucked in range so 5GHz usability was useless and it had awful USB support (problems).\n\nNow the Asus RT-AC87R (I am going to reference it as 87r, I owned that for 1 year), where to begin\u2026.\n\nI thought the 87r would be my router for years (boy was I wrong)\u2026\n\nThe 5GHz covered all my house inside, BUT, areas where I put my phone, (to do wifi to hardwired device remote control) just gave me constant problems, some days after a new firmware it seemed to work (sometimes) and I thought finally, then some day or days later BAM not working in those areas again. (Now before you think or say something, all I did was change to the Linksys router, NOTHING ELSE, more on that below).\n\nThe best I ever achieved from the 87r was about maybe a month with a firmware, before something went wrong, lag, wifi drops, etc.. I totally gave up on USB drives connected through it, now I have a NAS (Best purchase I have made in years)\n\nOnto my new Linksys EA8500, in my case, this is my first Linksys router I have ever owned.\n\nFirst what I read on it\u2026.\n\n- I read the web GUI was slow by some, I find it supper fast, I have no idea why others complain about that at all.\n\n- Wifi range, well the Linksys is the same as the 87R with 2.4 GHz range (outstanding), and noticeably better than the 87r on the 5GHz band.\n\n- I read of a few having some kind of power down after 6 hours or so, I have never seen this at all (the latest firmware update address this anyway for the ones with tis issue).\n\nNow my findings\n\nGood\n\n-Absolutely no dead wifi spots with the Linksys, super fast connection from my wifi app to wired lan control device.  I can't find any WiFi dead spots in my house with this Linksys router on 5 GHz or 2.4GHz. (As I have had with the 87r, especially with my remote app)\n\n- I have an app on my phone that connects to a hardwired device, on the 87r this was so bad and useless that the original (old) app no longer functioned and I had to buy a different app to get it to work, I no longer have my phone wifi to hardwired device control problems at all, both apps work great on the Linksys EA8500 and I checked for the latest update on the first app that went wonky on the 87r and it was not updated for 30+ days.\n\n- I no longer have any lag (tho dd-wrt firmware on the 87r removed it usually all the time, but it came back after days on the 87r).  My online gaming with Asus routers on Monday night\u2019s were all horrible, so bad that I usually shut down my PS4.  Now with the EA8500 my lag is very minimal.\n\n- Setup was simple, but I did do some reading into this before hand, so I knew what to tweak to get great performance out of the Linksys.\n\n- I did have a HP wifi printer problem, FIXED I had to reset my network settings in my HP printer (nothing with the router at all).\n\n- My download speeds since I installed the EA8500 are my best ever.  Any router before (including the rt-ac87r) I got a max of 30-32 down, now with the Linksys I always see 34-35.\n\n-I have adjusted some things in the settings and unlike the 87r, no firmware degradation at all...... Meaning every time I rebooted (I owned 2 87r\u2019s, first one died due to overheating) the 87r would perform worse and worse (more problems, etc..)after every reboot, no matter what firmware I used, until I flushed the ac87r and started from scratch again, it happened with both 87r\u2019s, I have complained about this from time to time with Asus and they did not care.  Nothing at all like this on the Linksys, the Linksys just works like it should and rebooting does nothing bad at all to it.\n\n- NO WiFi drops with the Linksys on either band, the Linksys just works and works perfectly.\n\n- Web page refreshes on wifi devices are the same as my Asus 87r (when it was working good)\n\n- I use and love the way QOS is used on the linksys (I hated the Asus way, tried it, never worked for me and turned it off).  I see no speed degrade with QOS on, my ps4 also has very little lag, that's my priority in the QOS for me, so QOS in this router works.\n\n- Linksys support is very great and responsive (from the printer issue I had, they gave me things to try on my Printer problem that turned out to be resettings network settings on the printer).\n\n- DHCP reservation is super easy on the Linksys, you click on \u201cNetwork Map\u201d and all of your connected devices are showing, just click a device and add DHCP reservation, it\u2019s that easy.  Linksys and I also recommends you do this, as some devices get confused (on any router)\n\nBad (if you call it bad)\n\n- The IOS app to configure the router does not work with IOS 9 beta yet, expected as it is a beta IOS, it does work from my android note 10.1 version 1 perfectly. (I use the web GUI anyway, but I don't have to go into that often at all due to the Linksys just working).\n\n- I have no idea what my wifi connections are at ( meaning 100, 300, 400, or 800), Asus and dd-wrt gave me this info, nowhere found on the Linksys. (This would be my only wish, but not needed)\n\n- I don\u2019t have lights up front and I like that, I do have a Linksys light on top that is steady when connected to my ISP and flashing when not, I do like this.\n\n- I do not like the fact I only get 90 days telephone support, but with quick e-mail and forum support, it\u2019s not needed.\n\n- Pricy but performance and stability is worth the price (I paid more for my Asus rt-ac87r a year before and that was nothing but problems and stuff not working the entire year, yah it has more bells and whistles but at slower speeds and very unstable hardware and firmware)\n\nSummery\nI don't have absolutely nothing bad to say or found about this router, I keep looking for something, not performing properly, but everything I do with the Linksys = it just works perfectly, to date.\n\nIf you are looking for tons of things to tweak, bloatware (I call it, you may not), love to reboot and have unstable hardware = look elsewhere, BUT if you are looking for a router with all the features needed and for a router that is stable as a rock = Look no further this EA8500 is the one!\n\nSo far I love this Linksys Router\n\nIf this stays like this, I have the best router made to date!\nThis is how a router should work, perfectly. NOT half baked!!",

I have a dozen devices (ip cameras, laptops, cell phones, tv's, smart devices, etc) connected and this handles all of them without problem. The app is pretty basic, as has been mentioned before in other reviews -- but I don't have excessive needs of my router other than to ensure it has adequate signal, adequate reach, and a sufficient UI.\nPLUS, this thing is able to setup as a Mesh Network.

I've had this for a week and it's one of the best purchases I've made.  No more WiFi extenders that didn't work that great anyway as well.  Easy mobile phone interface, 3 bars all thru the house even 2 bars in far corner of basement where I had the most trouble.  Not one connection issue, drop, or buffer ptoblem since I've installed....Kids run ipads, we have phones and xbox and 25 mps internet...The solution I needed.  The only drawbacks that I see is there is not alot of options on the mobile interface for tech folks, and I needed to use my current modem with it since it doesn't seem to be a modem and router combo, but maybe that's why it works so well.

Since my ISP upgrade my B/G devices were dropping connections, after I've installed this I only have one access point to manage - both 2.4 and 5 ghz devices connect to it, it auto changes channels as necessary to get best signal, and there are no more drops!  Other features I really enjoy is ability to prioritize connected clients - so the family room Roku gets priority over the kids surfing in their rooms.  Also, great options for parents that want easily turn off wifi during dinner, or family hour, or even use your phone to turn wifi off for a particular device until the homework is done.",

I have a 50Mbps ISP connection and with my old router and Wifi Repeater setup about 50 feet away through walls I would get about 8-15Mbps which was OK for most things. Now just with the On-hub router by itself 50 feet away I am getting 25-35 Mbps. Im sure if I added the other google wifi extenders it would even be faster but I think I am happy with it as is.

On top of that, I was able to easily make my girlfriend a manager of the router simply by entering her gmail account; no having to share an admin account and another password to remember. It's only been a day, but already this device has been worth every penny. I have another on order that I plan to send to my parents. I'm going to have them add me as a manager so that I can remotely assist with issues (if they every come up!).",

Combined with a Google Wifi puck on the first floor of the house (this is on the 2nd of 3 floors) it gives perfect coverage. I work from home on the 3rd floor of the house and this router gives me a 72% signal at 34dB SNR measured from my 2017 Macbook Pro. I routinely get Speedtest.net results of 120Mbps down and 6Mbps up which is the limit of what I'm paying for from Xfinity right now.\n\nThe Google Wifi app is great as well and has enough features for my usage. UPnP seems to work perfectly even for my two kids that play online games. My daughter has an XBox One and a PC both connected into a Gigabit Ethernet switch that's plugged into the OnHub. Everything works perfectly.\n\nDon't ponder, don't reconsider... just get this thing.",

Just downloaded the app, plugged it into the wall & modem, and it was set up and working in under 5 minutes. It looks really cool. Like the kind of thing you wouldn't mind having out in the open.\nI had a crappy N600 router before, and it didn't quite cover every single spot in the house. Not only does this cover every single spot in the house, but it maintains a connection with my phone, even as I leave the house and get up to two houses down the street.\nThe speeds are great. I ran a speed test before I set up the new router, and my download speed nearly doubled. (Keep in mind, I'm comparing that to a $30 router.)\nThe app doesn't come with a ton of customization options, but its super easy to use. You can still do basic stuff like port forwarding, and you can designate a device to receive priority, and you can check your speeds from the app.",

For years my kids have complained about have little or no wifi upstairs in our home...even the room located directly above our router.  I tried various extenders...one that plugs in an outlet and another that plugs directly into the computer via a USB plug.  These options may have helped a little, but never very well.  So, looking for other options, I thought I'd give the OnHub a try and I am so glad I did as it works fantastic!  We now have a great/fast wifi signal in every room of our house (~2500 square feet).  The set up was very easy and fast. I like that fact that it has a mobile app where you can check connections/speed anytime. If you are experiencing wifi issues, this is your answer!",

Its at one end of the house (not ideal, but a cable model installation issue), and gets us over 50% of our bandwidth in the farthest corners. At our AppleTV, which is where we need the bandwidth most, we get an astounding 100% of our bandwidth (135 MBPS). You should see an AppleTV app download! Actually you won't - its done in seconds.\n\nSetup was fairly straightforward, compared to the various Netgear and LinkSys routers I have installed over the last 15+ years, though it helps to know some basic terminology. The app is easy to use, and the industrial design is much less industrial than the Netters, for example. Its on a shel in our guest room and blends in, particularly because you can turn down the light ring to a very muted level, instead of other routers that insist on being seen from space!",

Is it really so much to ask to turn off or rename one of the broadcasting frequencies? I figured as a new product that maybe they would change this once complaints go around, but no. No advanced settings for niche uses that pop up when you least expect them. For that alone I would have purchased another product. The officials on the forums even acknowledged that theres a lack of control here, but the company has declined to cater to users with niche needs that could realistically be implemented with very little effort on behalf of the development team.\n\nAnother issue, the way the casing is designed will crush normal ethernet wires. It\u2019s frustrating because raising the darned bottom of the device or adding a breakaway piece of plastic on the back could have been really easy. So have fun crimping and crushing whatever ethernet cable you sacrifice to this device.\nAlternatively you could leave it exposed, but that doesn\u2019t feel right either. Swing and a miss here. There should be some subtle but significant design revisions to this product line moving forward.\n\nI\u2019m just disappointed. This could have been better. Form over function.",

The reviews for this device were excellent and its expandable to a mesh network if I needed it in the future, so I got it.\nFor the most part, it works fine. The app interface using google wifi is convenient. Setup wasn't super hard, but I considered myself to be technology literate. The router gives great speeds and connectivity is most parts of my little house (1500 sqft).\n\nThe reason I'm upset is that I bought this guy primarily to upgrade the reception in my bedroom (one story up from the router), but it seems my bedroom connection is still poor. Also, I'm connected to wifi in my driveway, but there's no data (like trying to load a google maps on my way out). Both these places are not that far from the antenna, so I expected better. It's a product with two very well recognized names on it, so I expected better. I guess for ~$100 it's pretty good, but I was expecting more.",

Due to the app based set up and router maintenance, it was a snap to set and  have your network operating in top order. The packaging of this item is beautiful, as someone had mentioned before, as beautiful as iPod packaging from years ago. The only drawback in the packaging is the lack of detailed instructions. After unboxing you must remove the shell/outer case on the router to remove plastic packing. It took me a few minutes how to remove the shell. The shell twist locks over the internals and was mildly difficult to get it twisted off. Other than the initial hic-up in physically setting up the router, everything else was a breeze. My favorite feature of OnHub's function is the easy ability to prioritize a specific device for a certain amount of time. With numerous devices in anyone's home hooked up to wifi, it is nice to set one as the priority for a certain time period, for downloading games for instance. Excellent piece of hardware that I highly recommend",

When certain devices only support 2.4GHz, solution is to move this device to a far end but still in range so only 2.4GHz signal is possible to reach. Second, no individual site blocking or other management features found in other routets. Alternative solution is to use OpenDNS. But yes users can still workaround this block.

While a little expensive for not being a \"top of the line\" router I would gladly pay the price tag again for the ease of setup and use. The OnHub arrived in it's standard Google packaging and included instructions. It did take me a few minutes to figure out how to open the casing that is around the outside of the router. Ultimately, you just have to pull a little harder than you think. Once the casing was off I was able to plugin the power and Ethernet cord from my router and get started. You setup the router using the Google OnHub app from your phone. The app makes setting everything up a breeze and only takes a few minutes. After the router is setup, you can monitor the status the internet, router, and devices connected to it along with the total data usage for each device. The signal strength is much better than my previous router. I'm excited to see what additional functionality Google (hopefully more smart home features) will add to the router and would recommend it to anyone.",

                "review_body": "Got this last night and installed it this morning. Initially it did not want to find the OnHub through my Google On app. Had to go through a manual setup process which was a little longer, but once done it was a breeze to set up the last few steps. Now I can clearly see every device on my network and make changes as necessary. Appears that this wifi signal will not reach much further than my previous TP Link Archer AC1900, BUT my speed went from about 16-18mbps to 70+mbps just by switching this out. Future plans are to add Google WiFi to the house, but wanted this for my base router to manage the future mesh network. I have a 3 story historic home, so getting LAN cables routed and wifi signals through the old shiplap walls is near impossible. Very impressed with how much faster my computers and devices are working just in the few hours I have had this installed. Looking forward to having a much improved wifi experience with this addition in our home!",

It's as simple as my Apple router was, but with many great features in the App.\n\nI live in a two bedroom apartment with MANY competing signals and I've not once had an issue. The setup was painless with the App and the diagnostics are great. I like having the ability to monitor the network when I'm away from home too.\n\nIt's stylish and unassuming so it sits right next to the TV instead of hidden away under a shelf. I'm sure that has alot to do with it's strong signal. I also can easily transfer a 2GB file wirelessly between 1-2 minutes across multiple rooms. I did have to buy a USB Wifi AC adapter to get the benefits of AC over N. It was honestly a night and day difference. So if you are going to get this make sure you upgrade or have devices that are Wifi AC to get the full benefits.",

Beautiful design, including the box it came in and seems to give a little more distance than my 5 year old Belkin. Easy to set up and like being able to set a priority device temporarily. Worth the money if I can eventually use z-wave smart switches and devices but may be too limiting if each one counts as one of my 10 max limit. I may have rushed this purchase because I knew TP-Link is coming out with a new router (SR20. I think) next month and since TP-Link makes this one,for Google, I was hoping it would be able to handle z-wave smart switches as promised with the SR20. Not finding fault with this, just thinking I may have spent too much instead of waiting another month.",

It allows me to take full advantage of my 120 Mbps connection in rooms near the router, and even the most distant rooms in the 1800 square foot 2-storey house get at least 80 Mbps and sometimes over 100 Mbps, whereas previously they might have gotten 25 Mbps.  The signal is strong out on the patio, and throughout a very long yard (except behind a separate, distant cinderblock garage).  The App interface is very easy to use, and provides detailed, helpful information on the state of the network.  At the same time, it has a simple, clear interface for doing what you need to do (setting up the main network and even the guest network, was a breeze).  Google also provides very helpful telephone support (the issue I called about turned out was in the end a problem with another device on the network and was easily fixed).  I highly recommend this router.  I had never purchased a Google (or Android) product before.  I doubt this will be my last.",

I have a small house with 4 very small bedrooms. About 1600 sq ft and signal is strong everywhere in the house AND outside in my front and back yard.\n- Over the air updates with no hassle\n\nCONS\n- Only one ethernet out port. This may or may not effect you.\n- USB 3.0 on the back currently has no function. Functionality could be added in a later update, but that has yet to be seen.\n\nConclusion\nAll in all this is the best router I have owned. It has been in use for 6 months now and I feel this is a good amount of time to be able to review it.  It\u2019s fast, it has great range and is easy enough to use even for those less tech savvy people. I would definitely recommend this router for anyone in the market for a new router.",

I love the Google OnHub application. The application shows me what devices are connected to the WiFi network, and will allow me to prioritize speed of a device if I need that connection to remain fast while there are many other connections. It also allows for an easy creation of a guest network with a separate password.\n\nPossibly my favorite part of this router is the fact that it will automatically shift devices between a standard 2.4Ghz network and a 5Ghz network to maintain a stable and usable speed for everyone. This router never goes down, and if something ever does go wrong I get a notification telling me exactly what the problem is (always has been my internet provider) and how to remedy it.\n\nAnother feature I love is that the Google OnHub app works even if you aren't connected to the router. You can be miles away and run a speed test, see who is on the network, and prioritize people's connections.\n\nYou won't regret purchasing this router!",

The hub downloaded an update after first finding it and told me to get a cup of coffee... no defined time or way to know when the upgrade was done.\n5. once coming back the app keeps putting up a Error: Registration Token Failure.  Tip to get past this as there is little info on the internet, pull the plug and reboot on hub.  Also delete or forget the WiFi networks it has tried to setup so you start over.\n6.  Do step 5 about 5-6 times and you may find success.\n7. Unfortunately then the app tells me onhub needs to be plugged in when the lights are Teal showing it should be up.  Pretty sure this is due to the app not following the key exchange with the hub.\n8.  Start from beginning.\n9.  No way to manually install or get to a web page to bypass the app.  Critical failure not to have another way when something like this does not work.\n10.  After 1.5 hours going back to old router and wait for Google to sort these out so it works.. perhaps an upgrade or two down the road.\n\nSuggested action for anyone not already buying this product WAIT!!!!!!

It would report \u201ctrouble saving your settings\u201d or hang forever in \u201ccreating your network\u201d. Hardware reset didn\u2019t work it seems (different light colors than expected by the support) as it didn\u2019t make any difference. The support people don\u2019t know much about networking. They asked me to connect directly using ethernet cable (setup wifi ssid also works it turns out) to the Hub and access 2 web pages: status and diagnostic-report at 198.168.86.1, then send the info to them.\n\nWell, after connecting I got a dhcp address in 198.168.82.x subnet. There were no pages in the 86 subnet (browser timeout), but those pages were present in the 82 subnet and looked legitimate. The support were still insisting however for me \u201cto go to the code 192.168.86.1\u201d, whatever that means, and try again and again.\n\nI left the device plugged in overnight and discovered that now I can use a (null)/setup network to access internet, but still cannot create my network. I reset the device to factory setting using the app, instead of the hardware button. This time it took several minutes during which I suspect the device updated its firmware. Only then I could create my network.\n\nAnother, minor, bug is that if there is another WiFi AP the setup doesn\u2019t recognize that you are automatically connected to it and doesn\u2019t prompt you to switch to the setup ssid, but happily proceeds and fails.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that my unit came with a buggy version of the firmware.

App is handy but far from perfect (adding a web interface option would make it better)\n\nIt does have some cons that should be considered prior to deciding on this as your router, especially at its price point:\n  1: Only 1 Ethernet port. This means that unless you only have one device you want to direct connect via wired cable, you'll have to have a switch....very disappointing. Great for a home that is all wireless though.\n  2: Only interface is the app. While the app is fantastic, it makes some things like Port Forwarding and more advanced setups more tedious than a web interface to the device would be.\n  3: Lack of Google Assistant is disappointing.  It has a speaker for initial setup so wouldn't it be nice if they just went ahead and added that",

The only downside to this that I can see is that it doesn't have dedicated 2.4 and 5ghz channels.  This is only an issue for me because I have a skybell and and a wifi camera that has to connect to a 2.4ghz network.  Spent some time on the support line and the customer support was friendly and helpful just unable to to resolve the issue.  I have to use my old router as a secondary wifi access point which was extremely easy.  My devices connect to my old router just fine on the dedicated 2.4ghz channel.  I have tablets, phones, laptops, PlayStation 3 and 4, and Alexa connected with no issues.  I do appreciate the mobile interface and the simplicity with which it works.  Wifi strength is good and I haven't had any other issues with this router.",

Ever since upgrading to this router my internet connection reliability/status doesn't even cross my mind. I went from rebooting my router every day or a couple times a day to forgetting about it entirely because it's so consistent and stable. This was easily the best home tech purchase I have made in probably 10 years. What an impact! Also, it is incredibly easy to setup and even easier to monitor/maintain the connection should you need to. I am sure there are some low-level tech limitations with it but as a works from home software developer with many custom requirements, I have found no limitation to my needs. I have 150Mbps internet up and down and my speeds wouldn't break 110Mbps on the stock router, but with this google router I get a consistent 150-160Mbps.\n\nI am so happy I got this router.",

I had a bit of trouble using an iPhone at first but it worked fine once it was setup. The app gives you total control over your network and you can even set priority to some devices for an specified amount of time up to 4 hours. We haven't had the need to use it because now everything works great on wifi.\n\nWe can't wait for Thanksgiving when we will have 20 people over and really test it out.

We read a lot about the Google OnHub and the NetGear router and because the OnHub boasted about being so user friendly, control it from your mobile device, adjust to what you need, and most of all the sales pitch was if what you are using at the moment needs the speed or bandwidth it will adjust and if you are a gamer (I am) you can make your console priority for up to 4 hours and not be bothered with slow or drops in speed. The OnHub was delivered on March 3, 2016, I have been trying to get streaming from Directv to work on my computer, (it will not work with the OnHub) the router has full speed at the base (only one port) 110 Mbs down, 25 Mbs up, (CORDED). I can't get full speed from the WiFi on most days, (distance from router is 20' only one wall) speed is not good until you restart it. (Before you restart it 20 -45Mbs down .7-4.3 up) (after you restart it 119 - 125 Mbs down 24 - 25 Mbs up which is what I pay for) There is only 4 devices on at a given time in our home, and Google says lets do all these test.... well I did those test in April, then again in August and they tell me they see nothing wrong, but yet when its acting up I can unplug it and plug up to the base and full speed and low speed on WiFi they seem to say its ok??? Google has a lot of work to do on this device before it is ready for market. I am not please that I had to do so much work for them in a warranty situation.  It is a bad product. If I could give it less then one star I would. I would give this product, the technical support and the customer service negative stars.  Don't buy this router, save your money.",

I have a tv room in a finished basement where I could never get good connection to wifi.  I've tried several routers over the years and nothing helped.  Finally, I am getting excellent coverage in the entire house, even the basement entertainment room.  Connection is even better upstairs where I never had an issue.  After the switch was added, setup with awesome quick and easy.  I never leave reviews... but felt compelled to share my experience to maybe help others with my experience.

Apparently when you are the big Gorilla in the Tech Industry, you can get away with even introducing the lamest of the products and get excellent reviews.\n\nIf you care anything about security, stay away from this product. \"Trust Us\" on what we are doing and do not worry seems to be the motto of this product. I can understand making the product simple for non-technical customers. But there is no excuse for not giving the tech-savvy what they expect in a router either. Looks like giving the tech-savvy the tools to make the router secure seems to be against what this router was designed for - to have unfettered access to everything on your network for whatever purposes.\n\nCan not hide my Network - I do not want the router company to be the judge of whether hiding the Network Name is safe or not. I will decide.\n\nNo MAC Address Authentication - Good luck taking away previously given access to your router. Even better luck taking away access from others if your password gets shared. You can not restrict access to your router by MAC Address. Know the Network Name (which can not be hidden anyway) and the password for the Router, you are into the Onhub of any one. You can not live 24 hours a day watching who is on and off your network.\n\nOn the plus side, the Multiple Antennas seem to carry the signal afar and I am not seeing as much buffering as before when Video Streaming. I am sure Google has plans to get much more out of the equipment later, but what is able to deliver now is not worth the price of the product. Avoid it for until later.\n\nThe only reason I have decided not to return the product is, so I can honestly evaluate the \"new\" features that will appear later on this device for myself and not rely on the \"Technical Reviews\" on the web.",

                "review_body": "I've had the OnHub in service at home for about a month now, and I am happy to report that it works phenomenally.  I was attracted to the omni-directional design and the 13 internal antennas.\n\nI was previously using the gateway provided with my AT&T Uverse service, which was an Arris NVG-589 and worked perfectly within 20 or 30 feet of the gateway.  I have a Ring Doorbell Pro mounted on the outside of my house, about 15 feet from the location of my gateway (on the other side of a brick wall). With my old gateway I had to use a wifi extender that was attached to the front window in order to get the doorbell to connect.  Since switching to the OnHub, I was able to eliminate the front window extender and can get solid signal almost across the street in the neighbors front yard.\n\nThere is definitely an overall improvement in signal and range in the entire house, plus the device looks more like a piece of home decor sitting on the table than a traditional wireless gateway due to its lack of external antennas and cylindrical design.\n\nI definitely recommend the OnHub AC1900 for anyone looking to improve their wifi strength and reception.",

It gives us good range and the app allows you to have a good bit of control, however, there are no parental controls outside of pausing the wifi for dinner etc.  I like the automatic features as it always routes traffic and is constantly optimizing channel traffic, however, the automatic features are also the downfall in my application.  I need to turn off Wifi Multi Media (WMM) in order to get last gen apple tv to stream from my laptop to my Tv without stuttering. (It works via ethernet, but not wirelessly)  All features are automatic and there is no way to turn off WMM manually.  There is only one ethernet port so you will need to buy a switch if you have the need of having more than one item connected via ethernet cable.  We bought an inexpensive TP-link range extender and have Onhub and the range extender giving us  over 10,000 sq foot coverage.  If you don't need manual control this is a great router.",

I can sit at the balcony getting Wi-Fi, something that wasn't possible with any router before.\n\nOne of my friends had Wi-Fi trouble and wanted to make sure she is gonna have good Wi-Fi coverage on the second floor when she gets a baby and gets a baby monitor on Wi-Fi. Of course, I first recommended cables, but in the end I brought my own OnHub to see how much it would improve in her particular home. Usually she had a very intermittent internet connection from her bedroom, but with this router she was able to stream YouTube movies seamlessly. Now, I have to buy one for her as well. :-)\n\nI know this review is very anecdotal and although I've walked around with a Wi-Fi analysis tool on my (Android) phone, this might as well be very particular to the type of devices you've available. However, it's more difficult to motivate people to write positive reviews and I think the TP-Link engineers in this case really deserve some praise!\n\nIf you're into running dd-wrt on your own linksys router, this is of course not for you. The number of options are limited. Although there are some cool features for guest and family (like a timer when there will be no internet for kids).",

It has a much friendlier interface than I'm used to seeing (coming from DD-WRT).  There are two things that brought this from a 5 star rating, both of which should be easily fixable via a firmware update.  I would have love to have seen support for WPA Enterprise (bonus points for a built-in Radius server).  I would also love the ability to automatically update Google's (or anybody's) DNS servers dynamically when my ISP changes my WAN IP.  Seriously, give me a terminal, curl, and a cron tab and I'll be a happy guy, Google.\n\nSomething else that I haven't seen reviewed yet is that the OnHub supports bridged mode.  If you're like me and have a rackmount firewall already servicing your network and would like to keep it that way, you can have this device hanging off of a switch and it will become a dumb switch, passing DNS and DHCP requests upstream.\n\nAll in all, I'm pretty happy.

Easy and fast to set up, easy to connect devices to, and fast wifi speeds make this a must buy for anyone frustrated with their router stability or speeds.\n\n** My Story **\nI'm in the tech industry but have a fairly casual setup at home. My cable provider (AT&T U-Verse) gave me a modem/router combo. The problem is it's stuck in the master closet which makes it also surrounded on almost all sides by bathroom walls and pipes and the fireplace. That means the wifi signal is dead in some parts of the house and ok in others. Super frustrating.\n\nSo, I did some research and I bought an Apple Airport Extreme. Excellent reviews. After installing it, the speed and signal strength were better (not a ton but better) BUT now none of my devices could connect to it. There is a common bug with the Airport that doesn't accept the wifi password you set up. Unbelievably frustrating.\n\nSo THEN I ordered the OnHub. Returned the Airport Extreme. In a former dead spot with the original router, or in a spot that got just 3Mbps with the Airport Extreme, the OnHub was giving me 200+Mbps speeds! I've been highly impressed with the stability of the connection, strength / distance of the connection (all the way out to the street in front of my house), and how easy the app makes setup and management.

Compared to my previous very well rated TP Link router that I purchased 3 years ago, this router has much much stronger signal and therefore much faster speeds when further away from the router. If you're looking for a google wifi router purchase this ONE before buying the 3 pack of the \"puck\" style routers at this model includes 13? antennas for extremely good long range.\n\nHaving recently moved and installed this router on a 150mb/sec internet connection, the slowest speeds I see in my 3400 sq ft house with this one router are about 30-40mb/second. I can max out the connection speed throughout half of my home which is unbelievable in my opinion.\n\nObviously the mesh capability of this router is / would be great but just as a standalone router it's phenomenal. Yes, it's lacking \"QOS\" but for the average person that means nothing, plus with internet speeds continously pushing 100mb/sec + there shouldn't be an issue with one device not having enough bandwidth. You CAN also select one device to prioritize over a 4hr period so if you're in need of the strongest connection for one device you're in luck.\n\nOverall, great product. Buy this before the google puck sized router, you'll be glad you did when you're on the other side of your house and still getting a strong connection.",

                "review_body": "Bought this brand new back on June 9th 2016. Worked great up till about 2 weeks ago. Still troubleshooting with Google OnHub support. I'll update with progress.\n\n(Update August 27th 2017) - I have a love for tech. I have a love for Google. I work in telecom, and love a clean home network. I bought this wifi router with the expectation that its single unit coverage of 2000+ square feet would be more than enough to deal with my 1600 square foot house built in 1965.\n\nSad to report, it does not. Issues are mainly with Apple products. They do not stay on the wifi. Even as I write this, on my 2017 Apple iPad, I've had to turn off the wifi, turn on the VZN LTE just to remain on to write this review.\n\nThinking the issue might be location, as this is a split level home and the heart of the network is in my office adjacent to the garage, I spent an additional $115 for the newest Google wifi single unit. That unit was placed 30 feet from the Google OnHub, and is acting as a mesh bridge. No longer do my Apple products have any connection issues....in the living room where the Google Wifi unit sits. Yet the connection issue remains problematic on the upstairs level of the house. All bedrooms have no constant wifi connection, and the only way for these Apple products to have connection is to go into settings and re-establish wifi connection.\n\nAll reports of these issues remain unanswered, at least the investigations I have spent looking for a fix. This is sad. There could be too many factors involved. Google GUI issues? TP Links hardware issues (doubt it)? Apple iOS issues? Who knows. There appears to be no conflict with non Apple laptops and Android phones. I have not tested anything else because all TVs and desktop computers are hard wired. Hopefully this Apple product issue can be resolved, as this has been going on since the birth of OnHub.",

                "review_body": "I've had this router for about 2 months.\n\nPROS: GREAT OOBE (out of box experience). The packaging is minimally sublime. It was not obvious how to remove the cover to expose the ports, but I managed to figure that out without forcibly breaking it. The setup is stupid simple--you just install the smartphone app (I have an iPhone) and the rest of the management is done through that.  App has cool parental features (like pausing a selected group of devices) that are nice, but I don't really need (yet).\n\nCONS: You need a Google account (gmail) to make it work (no big deal for me, I have one) but this functionality means Google always knows about your router. I'm still not sure how I feel about that. But the real reason for taking away 3 stars is because it is simply so unstable it needs to be replaced. My old Belkin router it replaced could reach the master bedroom (only about 30 feet away on the same level) but this one works sometimes, and other times it just drops off to zero coverage. This was confirmed using the included iPhone app which rates your WiFi connection. Sometimes it would say great, other times it would say not connected.  Furthermore, my bathroom is halfway between (about 15-20 feet) and it actually drops the signal for no discernible reason while I'm in the middle of using it.  Worse still, I had it drop my connection--while I was looking at it, from only 8 feet away!  Also, when I bought this, I thought it supported the same mesh router expanders that newer Google WiFi routers support, but that does not seem to be the case. Also, WTH is the USB port for? It does not seem to be usable.\n\nSUMMARY: I cannot recommend this router.  It is now too late to return it, so I will try to find another use for it elsewhere, where dropped connections are not a huge deal.",

The router is run through a smart phone app. If your router is hooked PPPOE, and you open the app on the phone, you will lose internet connection. After months of communication with google helping them problem solve, I received an email in October 2016 stating that they were able to recreate the problem and it is their top priority. They said they would have a fix within 6 weeks. It is now March 2017 and it is still crashing. Very disappointed in the lack of attention to this, and the empty promises. I can't believe they continue to market and sell this product when they know it is defective!!! I've copied and pasted the email from October below:\n\nEmail from ONhub 10/5/2016: Hope you're having a wonderful Wednesday! This is Ryan the Subject Matter Expert from OnHub Support. I wanted to give you an update on the issue with the network dropping when using the Google On app with PPPoE WAN Settings enabled. We have been investigating the issue thoroughly since we last spoke. The good news is that the team has been able to reproduce and has found the root cause of the issue.  Currently we are investigating the best fix for the issue.\n\nOur Engineers are still actively looking into the best solution to resolve this issue. Our plans moving forward is to create and test a fix for this issue, and then make the fix available to our customers  This issue is one of our top priorities!  We aim to do firmware releases every 6 weeks, however if a fix was made available, we will try to push a maintenance release outside the normal 6 week cycle.\n\nI want to thank you for all your help and let you know that we tremendously appreciate your patience. I do understand that this has been inconvenient and frustrating, and please accept our apologies.  We strive to make the OnHub experience great for our users and hopefully we can provide a better experience for you in the near future.\n\nIf you have any other questions or concerns, please feel free to reply directly to this email. We\u2019re also available by phone 24/7 at 866-844-6393. We\u2019re to help!\n\nCheers,\n\nRyan\nOnHub Subject Matter Expert",

                "review_body": "We have Verizon and have their router. I could get service very well inside the house of about 1500 square feet but as soon as we would walk out the back door it would drop.  We wanted service in an outside shed used as an office (for our tablets) and the barn. I am almost 70 and am the only one who understands even a little bit about computers.  I hooked it up to the Verizon router because I was afraid to unhook it and start from scratch with that and try to get someone at Verizon. I used my tablet as the base central to set it up. I did everything in the pictures (no manual) and it still would not go to teal. I called Google Customer Service and we fooled with it for a bit and could not get it to go to teal. Because my arms were tired I laid it on the desk right over the connection under my monitor and it came right on. Obviously my set up is not perfect and I will disconnect the slow and old Verizon router but we have service in the yard, the barn (metal pole barn) and office in a wooden shed. I did put One Hub on a shelf near the window closest to the shed. Works great. So happy! I even went to U Tube. You must know people on U Tube you need to speak English not Computer.",

Once you connect the OnHub to your modem, you download the Google Wifi app to setup your OnHub. While the OnHub has a setup network name and password, you will get to use your own network name (SSID) and password. You can setup a guest network and you're able to manage family devices. This means that you can disconnect the internet from any device of your choosing at any time. For example, if you work from home, you can set priority to that device for a set time period. You can the option to setup port forwarding, customize the DNS, DHCP IP, etc. The advanced settings allow advanced users the ability to customize it even further. You're able to purchase additional Google Wifi points to add to your existing network for places in the home that you want to create a mesh network. Example, you may want to have a better signal on your sunporch, basement, etc. In my trilevel tow home with the OnHub on my middle floor, I'm actually able to stream Netflix without it buffering and play games on the PS4 without the lag. I do like that I can test the speeds of the internet and wifi directly from the Google Wifi app. I wish that when testing the wifi speeds that it gave an actual number instead of good or poor. My internet speed test shows over 200Mbps.",

While there are not near as many options as with a router running dd-wrt, the setup, performance and ease of maintenance more than make up for it.  This is the first router I have seen that I think most people could easily setup and maintain.  So far I have never had to reset this router or have had any connection drops.  With my old routers, some streaming services such as Hulu would stutter even with my 50Mbps connection.  Since I have changed over to the OnHub I have experienced 0 stutters or buffering with every streaming service I use.  These include Netflix, HBOGo, Hulu, Vudu, Amazon Video and FXNow.  I was hesitant to spend the money on this router, but it has been well worth ridding my life of frustration of faulty WiFi connections.\n\nUpdate 2/15/2016\nThe router is still running strong with 0 problems.  I have not had to reset this router even once.  I have since purchased another OnHub for my parents.  They have reported that they no longer have any buffering issues and no longer have to restart the router.  It is also nice to be able to pull out my phone and check on the router from any location.  I have not yet had to use the app to solve any router problems but I do keep a watch on their network.  New updates have continued to add features.",

For me, I wanted something that was easy to manage remotely and was simple to troubleshoot. Enter, the original Google OnHub!\n\nIn my use case, I set this up at my parents house. While they may not be technophobes, being able to visually see a red ring on the device to know that your wifi is down is simply magical. The Google WiFi app sending me a push notification that the router lost internet access, preps me to get ready for a tech support call. Sounds silly, but it improves my quality of life even though I'm not using it!\n\nAs for configuration and the fact that you more or less have nothing to mess with, to me is a plus. It seems to be setup well enough to secure them from the script kiddies. If you're looking for something to tinker with, go build yourself a DIY router and run pfsense or Sophos. (that's what I did!) But if you want your wifi to just work and ease that mental load, this fits the bill quite well. It being able to extended with a wifi mesh node is just icing on the cake.\n\nHighly recommended to those that need to support things remotely, and for those that just want things to work with minimal fuss.",

The app stops listening when the unit starts making noise.\n3. You can't configure it from a browser, you must use the app, and when the internet is down or the unit is malfunctioning, the app doesn't work.\n4. It doesn't like to have the same SSID as other wireless access points on the same network.\n5. In Bridge-mode it doesn't have any of the advanced IoT features.\n6. When it started disconnecting every device every 10 seconds, google wanted me to spend *days* diagnosing it via email.\n\nThis was the final straw. The unit stopped functioning correctly, a factory reset borked the app (where you can't delete an existing profile of a device that has been replaced or reset). After the factory reset, and an attempt to configure it on another phone, it complained that the WAN connection was down. It was not. I verified it with 2 other devices. TP-Link did not include a simple link-light on the ethernet port, so no way of performing diagnostics visually.\n\nWhen I opened a case with Google, I was asked to go through a painfully long diagnostic process, where the operator did not seem to understand that the device drops the connection every 10 seconds. He would ask me to perform a step, and when I told him that the connection had dropped before the operation had started, or that the operation was hanging because the connection dropped, he wanted me to start again.\n\nNext the process switched to being via email, and with a 1-2 day latency between responses, I've been without a wireless access point for weeks, and they still want me to try diagnosing it. One of the technicians told me that \"it might take 5-10 resets to fix\". I don't work for Google, I don't get paid to sit and mess with an appliance for hours on end.\n\nAfter more than 2 weeks, I am being authorized for a replacement, but that's through TP-Link which wants me to send the unit it before getting a replacement. Or I can pay for an advanced replacement, but it will be 2 days before they can let me know.\n\nUnless you want to be an unpaid beta tester for TP-Link and Google, and you can be without wireless for weeks on end, I recommend spending half as much on a device that actually works.",

I bought one 6mo ago, and was able to set up a WiFi network that supported at least 10 devices, incl. Apple, Amazon, Google and Roku devices.  The Google WiFi App setup worked well and Wifi range was impressive. I bought a second OnHub to deal with areas outside my house, but my established system could not find the new router.  After two hours fruitlessly trying everything the Google help desk recommended, I ended up exchanging for a new one, w/o any better luck.  The eventual solution, perhaps obvious to some, was to erase the network, then separately restore factory settings to each OnHub while it was connected to the modem; presumably, the firmware in the two router was incompatible  So, persevere if your initial 2-router system setup fails!",

I had no idea before what a difference good hardware support in the firmware makes in terms of internet speed.  I was getting at most 30Mbps (paying for 85Mbps) over wireless and wifi connections and I had been internally blaming Comcast for my woes.  When I switched to this router, connection speeds shot up significantly to a little faster than I am paying for.\n\nSay what you will about the merits of managing the device with \"yet another app\".  It's a well made app and easy to use with all of the options that I needed.  In fact, I found myself pleasantly surprised that you can run speed test from within the app, and choose to measure either the internet speed from your phone's perspective or from the router's perspective, which is really nice.\n\nOverall, a very nice router.  My only complaints are: There are some finicky issues with DNS for devices that are connected using the wired connection.  You should manually set the DNS server IP addresses for those devices (particularly if you want to host a Plex server, or use a desktop computer or Steam Link on the wired connection with Steam in-home streaming).  The router only has 1 LAN ethernet port, so you will need to buy a small 5-port hub to support more than 1 wired device.",

Id lag and get kicked from ps4 game lobbies every night. Biggest mystery when I turned on my hardwired ps4, 1-2 of my nest cameras would go in and out of wifi the whole time and say connection interference. Wasn't like I had an old router either. Ive tried over 10 routers $50-$350 routers in 6 months. All did same exact thing.\n\nFrom the sec I connected google onhub, it has worked perfectly!!!\nI ran it through the extreme test. I have 3 nest cameras 1080, 2 nest thermostats, 2 ps4's, 2 iphones, 2 macbooks, 2 smart tv's. I turned them all on and connected them all to wifi. On my laptop I pulled up about 15 tabs of high quality videos on youtube, played them all at same time. So I have 13 devices connected to wifi. HD cameras, laptops playing many high quality videos and then I ran speed test while all this is running. I got 117 download and 11 upload through speedtest. This is through wifi...! Im only paying for 100mbs download and 10mbs upload... To run all this and have everything working flawlessly without buffering is amazing. All my issues I had before have not happened since I plugged in my google router.\nBest $99 i've spent.\n\nI didn't expect it to be this good!",

I'll go Pro and Cons\n\nPros\nSetup was just as easy as described, cool little gimmick with your phone talking to the router, very neat. Downloading the update took about 5 minutes, so not too terrible.\nLooks - it looks awesome! the subtle LED ring at the top, the cool little cylinder shape and covering (the blue part), all very well done.\nOptions - The google wifi app gives you plenty of options like LED ring brightness and easy DHCP/Port forwarding. All fine and dandy.\nThat ends the good stuff\n\nCons\nDesign - I know I just said it was a PRO but that is just the aesthetics, the functional design is just dumb. The one port on the back of the router gets completely crimped if you try and close the housing over it and use that port. Maybe they expected you to use their low profile/slim Ethernet cords only? Locking someone into your product is a bad idea, Ethernet cords go bad, fray, break, etc. Let me use what cord I want to use.\n\nSmart Hub functionality - maybe I got a defective unit, maybe I didn't, I really don't know but I do know that this was the worst router I've ever purchased...ever. If I was streaming from my phone, I couldn't use my Xbox. Perform a speed test and everything is A-Ok! 80mbs down and 20mbs up. Stream from a laptop and I can't even play Pandora on my phone!!! seriously? 100 devices? This couldn't even handle two. I reset it several times, reset my modem, ran tests throughout the house (only 1400 sqft) and it just fails every time.\n\nCont..I think the issue is the \"smart\" part, it doesn't recognize how much bandwidth to assign for a certain task. For instance  I was watching Netflix on Xbox, if you looked at the bandwidth usage on the Google Wifi App, it shows NOTHING. 0.1kbs down and up when it should at least spike to 30-50mbps. It simply never assigned proper bandwidth and I even tried using the \"Priority\" device functionality. Same issues occurred.\n\nMentioning the wired issue is just the cherry on top, to put it short, it didn't work. I had to reset my modem and router twice in order for it to recognize the wired device. DONE.WITH.THIS.\n\nI plugged in my old router and everything started working like normal, all of my devices can stream at the same time and I have no issues. The whole reason I purchased this router was to see if the OnHub device ecosystem would work for me in the future. After this horrendous experience I'd be skeptical to try again.",

I use the OnHub plus two Google WiFi's to cover a 1600 sqft two story farm house that is mostly plaster and lathe. The OnHub covers the second floor and the two WiFi's cover the 1st floor plus the garage, patio, and front porch. I have wireless internet from a local provider using PPPoE. It has been three months and everything is still working great. The OnHub was easy to set up and adding WiFi's to the network was easy as well. I also needed a network switch for the wired connections that the old router handled. There are usually around 15 devices on the network at any given time including a Directv genie, smart tv with built in directv, wireless printer, two phones and two tablets, a three piece sonos system, a home theater receiver, blu-ray player, and two computers one with a wired connection. I use a MoCA for directtv with the smart tv, the genie is hooked to an older tv. I have a second network switch hooked up to the MoCA so that I can use it for the HTR and blu-ray player which are wired connections and did not work well with wireless bridges. Could not be happier with the system and like the fact that firmware updates are automatic. Even with a range extender the old network was weak in spots and the extender was somewhat unreliable. The new mesh system covers everything with no issues. Only time will tell on long term reliability I will update this review if there is a reason to do so.",

I have a 3700 sq foot home, 2 story and I've placed it upstairs and I get full bars all over the house. I used to have an Airport Extreme, plus an Airport Express and now the onhub replaces them both. Download speeds went from around 25M to 85M on my iphone and ipad. I love the ease of use and love the fact that I can check who's online and using how much bandwidth in real time from my phone. So why the 2 stars might you ask? Well, after about 7-10 days, one of the devices dropped wifi connectivity. I was right next to the onhub, but it wouldn't connect. I had to turn wifi off/on. Then a few days later, the same thing happened to another/different device. And this has repeated every 7 to 10 days to one of the devices. I've opened up a Google support ticket and they are looking into it, so I will come back and update this review if there's a fix. I never had this problem with the Airport extreme/express and I'm bummed because I really like the onhubs speed and range. I've now configured two static IP addresses on two of my devices. If you are wondering how to do that, the onhub only uses .100 to .200, so you can statically configure an address outside that range. So far, jury is still out though, those two devices haven't dropped wifi connections...",

It appears Google has many more enhancements coming\n- The lack of other interfaces to manage the product is disappointing.  No ipad or laptop management.\n- Some power users will be disappointed of the lack of advanced QOS, ability to turn certain features on and off.\n- No ability to split 2 and 5 Ghz networks off with separate SSID's.\n\nOverall if you want a set it and forget it router, this is probably one of the better options on the market with an acceptable price point.  I have swapped out the installed firmware on numerous routers with DD-WRT as well to extend their features, and I have yet to find a solution that gave me reliable service for weeks on end.

But I am here hoping that they push an update pretty soon to add more advanced features. Yes I know that they were going for simplicity, but there are standard features that most if not all wifi routers have out of the box these days, like the ability to restrict internet access on certain devices connected to the router. On my old linksys, I had my network configured to only allow internet access between certain times on specific days on the mac addresses on all of my kids' devices, along with safety filtering on specific keywords on their devices, and these are standard built in features on a very old $40 wifi router which I never bothered to run a firmware update on. When I chose to spend $200 on this router, I anticipated that I would be able to do something relatively similar to these basic settings, but there are no advanced settings for this device whatsoever. I would think that there should at least be a way to turn on advanced settings for more in-depth users. Now to continue to have controls on my kids' internet access I have had to continue to let them connect to my old router, which is now taking up the only LAN port on the OnHub, splitting my wifi into two separate networks, and generally making things very inconvenient for my home automation setup devices that require a LAN connection. Had I known I wouldn't have these settings, I would have waited or looked for another router option. I hope that Google/TP-Link realizes the need some users have for these advanced features and includes them in the next update. If this ever changes, I will happily update my review to 5 stars, because the little bugger really is fast.",

                "review_body": "I bought this router because I was sick of paying the monthly \"rental fee\" the integrated modem/routers from Spectrum/AT&T.  Our general home network usage is streaming video services (Netflix, HBO, Amazon Prime), VPN traffic for work, some sporadic downloading, video calls, and general web browsing. Neither of us are gamers and we were at the time, living in a 1080sqft high-rise apartment complex with many nearby units (i.e. lots of WiFi traffic/interference).\n\nAfter looking at a variety of routers--including the Netgear AC1900 which by all standards, is an excellent router and is highly rated--I went with the Google OnHub for its simplicity and elegance. Call me a sucker for aesthetics but the damn thing really looks nice. Also, the inclusion of a congestion-sensing radio to automatically switch WiFi channels was a feature I had never heard of and wanted to try out.\n\nSetup was fairly painless. The Google WiFi app walks you through the setup in a dummy-proof manner..which can be slightly infuriating for more advanced techies. Once it's up and running, it works flawlessly. The only signal dropouts we had were due to AT&T U-Verse service dropouts. The router is entirely controlled through the Google WiFi app and you can add others to co-manage your network.\n\nThis router definitely isn't for folks who like to tinker under the hood of their routers. It only has 1 wired connection and a USB port that's only for recovery purposes. No hooking up your USB external drive to act as a networked drive.\n\nI liked the simplicity and ease of this router so much that I purchased one for my 70+ mother who is a technophobe. The router just works for her and an added bonus is I can remotely manage her network.\n\nI highly recommend this router for anyone looking for a basic router than that works and you don't have advanced networking needs.",

This is also clearly a beta product, but google is continually pushing updates to it so its a well supported beta product. It is super easy to use, unless you need advanced user features like a router run VPN.\n\nThe environment this was meant for is the smart home, where every device need will need wifi access, not just your laptop and maybe a smart TV, but the oven, the dryer, even the front door and light bulbs can access the internet and talk to each other. With all these devices any standard router would get bogged down and the performance would suffer, but on the google onhub everything is fine.\n\nIFTTT adds a nice level of programmability to my home, when the onhub detect my phone on the wifi network it can tell the hue lights to turn on, or tell nest to turn the heat to my preferred level.\n\nI live in a condo and can see fifteen different networks, the ohhub is scanning throughout the day checking to see what wifi bands are crowded and witch are empty and automatically switch to less used ones.\n\nThere are some drawbacks, onhub does not have a webpage like most other routers, if you exist in a pure windows environment then you will not be able to use this router, you MUST use an android or ios device to set up and maintain the onhub.  This also means that any settings or port forwarding that you want to do you have to do from your phone or tablet rather than a desktop computer, not the end of the world for me but it may be a deal breaker for others.",

About 12 speakers including sonos amp for 2 ceiling speakers, 2 subwoofers  and boost. So I always been having sound dropouts when streaming or even watching TV. I noticed hardly any sound dropouts when I switched to OnHub AC1900. I was most impressed when all it came was one device instead of 2,3,etc devices to place all around the house and cheaper.\n\nAT&T U-verse fiber installed their modem/router in my living room where my tv setup was at so I tested speeds on my laptops and tv's with amazon fire tv upstairs. Found TP-link to be faster than Google's whole home wifi and less dropouts.\n\nOn Orbi whole system (2 orbi's one downstairs and one upstairs).. I was getting 310MBPS upstairs. Fastest speeds out of all the other systems including TP-Link but not on all devices and sometimes did get audio dropouts downstairs in my tv room. Much better than before but still got some drop outs.\n\nOverall TP-Link I feel was best for me since I got less dropouts and great speeds on my devices, plus it's only one device and cheaper route\n\n**Update*  April 2017.\n\nI switched backto Orbi with 3 Orbi's total. My internet was clogged up when I was watching a stream on twitch, downloading a game & watching youtube with 2 TP-Link OnHub's. I decided to try out 3 Orbi's.

It appeared to me to be some sort of magical new device that you could attach to your existing network hardware that would automatically optimize bandwidth usage for you.  If that had been the case and it had actually worked, I'd be writing an entirely different review.  In reality this is just a router and access point combined.\n\nIf we'd needed a new router, or even if we were easily able to swap ours out I would have given it a try...but we use a Sonicwall firewall as our router...and we don't want to give up the benefits of a hardware firewall.  Our wireless network is created with Ubiquiti Unifi access points.  They are amazing and we got them from Amazon...so check them out if your looking for inexpensive yet powerful access points.  So in our case, because we are very happy with the hardware we already have in place for these 2 functions, the On Hub doesn't provide any additional benefits for what I could tell.  So we never bothered setting it up.\n\nSo why did I get this?  Because we have significant bandwidth issues.  We're know that those problems are due to our heavy use of Apple mobile devices...and the fact that we take a ton of videos and high resolution photographs for our work on a daily basis.  Apple's newish (since ios 8) iCloud photo backup aggressively usurps bandwidth and according to Apple there's not a simple way to manage this.  We were hoping this device would see what a bandwidth hog our Apple devices are and that it would limit the amount of bandwidth available to them....but no such luck :-(\n\nSo until somebody comes up with something that does that we're left with placing all of our devices into airplane mode when we want to stream a show on Netflix.  Which works....it's sort of bizarre how the moment we get all our devices into airplane mode, the spinning busy circle disappears and we can stream our show...but that means we can't actually be multitasking and doing stuff on our iPads while we watch TV!\n\nOne more important point to add is that we did not see the warranty detail that is now displayed below the items description stating that these devices are non-returnable unless they are defective and 'dead on arrival.'  I'd have been pretty ticked if I'd gone to return this and found out we couldn't.  I did read through the items description and several longish user reviews as well as did some online research too to try and figure out what exactly these were, prior to purchasing...but it wasn't until I received it and read through the setup instructions that I understood what the device actually is.  Which is why I'm writing my review!!!  Luckily, I never even got to the point of attempting to return it because one of our kids told us he needed a new router so we mailed it to him.  But buyer beware...this item is nonreturnable!",

                "review_body": "I saw some bad reviews on this when using it as a mesh. So I hooked it up directly from my modem to spread the signal. Then I used 3 decent \"ac1200 or better\" routers and created a wireless bridge. Thus my own DIY mesh network.\nGoogle onhub is above all my expectations after reading reviews. Im a computer tech by trade and I see a lot of different routers and mesh network systems now. It made things so simple that I think anyone could do what I did.\nOnhub is amazing to say the least. \"My house by the way, is almost 4,000 square feet so we arent talking a small house.\"  And my network covers every inch of my house with an amazingly fast wireless speed. I can even get full bars on the signal 3 houses down so its covering 10,000 square feet and onhub is a big part to do with the speed. The routers are carrying the distance.\nHere are my tests:\n*My old network had an xfinity modem/router combo with 3 routers, wireless bridged to spread throughout my house. I got on average 20-50mbps down and 8-12 up. Coverage was complete crap in my 4,000m square ft house.\n*My new network consists of my xfinity modem/router combo, onhub hooked on that with a 25 ft. ethernet cable so I could center it in my house, then I linked 3 tp-link routers to wirelessly bridge to the tp-link onhub. What a difference! Now I get on average about 80mbps down and 10-12 up. A few devices like my laptops and desktops are getting over 200mbps sec down and 10-15 up!!! Plus every inch of my 3876 sq ft house, yard, and neighbors houses(lol) are covered! My network must be covering at least 10,000 square ft!\nI bought the onhub for $90 on sale and the 3 routers cost me about 60 dollars each. Not bad for a DIY mesh network. Thank you google!\n\nI recommend google onhub to all my customers now.\nI recommend this to anyone looking to get the most out of their internet.\nAnd the seller is amazing too! Fast, courteous, easy to contact, and selling a great $200 item for less then half price at the time I bought this.",

                "review_body": "I have now used this for several months, and I've got to say it is the best router I've ever used (for the casual user).\n\nPROS:\nAmazing range with a very strong signal throughout the household. We used it in a 2 bedroom apartment, and never once lost a full signal. In our 4 bedroom house, we will possibly need an extender, but only because of where we have to place it in the house. The signal travels downstairs just fine, but it doesn't reach to the far corner of the house in the guest bedroom downstairs. Hard to explain, but a normal router would never make it that far, and this one just gets a 1-2 bar signal that sometimes goes out down there. I can live with that.\n\nVery easy setup. Plug it in, get the app going on your phone, sync up, and voila, you've got a signal.\n\nSpeed is FAST. I've had several routers that couldn't get past the 50mbps to save your life. This baby shoots past that and doesn't look back. I've gotten to my max of 100mbps throughout my house, and usually average around 80mbps, which I blame more on my provider than the router  (because I get the same with direct connection).\n\nVisually pleasing. Doesn't LOOK like a router, and actually stands out as a decoration. Routers always have that \"techy\" look, whereas this one stands out as more of an interesting piece in the room.\n\nCONS:\nCustomization isn't there. As a normal user of the internet, with no need for tweaking my router in the least bit, it's not a con for me. I can surf the web, check email, play games if I want, and use all my devices without a problem. HOWEVER, many people like to customize their settings a bit more, and this router isn't for them (but those people probably know that, and they're not even going to read this review).\n\nOnly one port for direct connection makes it to where you have to purchase a hub in order to have more direct ethernet. I bought a nice 5 port hub for cheap, and it does a fantastic job. You really don't NEED it, but if you have any devices that aren't wireless, or you just want that direct speed, you'll want to buy a hub.\n\nWe absolutely love this thing, and we will end up buying the recommended extenders down the road.",

                "review_body": "Never thought I'd be so delighted with something as mundane as a router.  I read all the reviews, and sure, if you are super-techy, you may not like that the only way to control this router is with the Google App (although from the techy reviews I read, there are ways to do sophisticated things with this router, and apparently the customer service is fantastic).\n\nWhat worked for me was that I literally just plugged it in, connected it to the App on my phone.  While there weren't directions, it was pretty intuitive--download the google wifi app, then there is a code on the bottom of the router---look in your wifi options for \"setup\"--then when it asks for the passcode, you have to enter that number on the bottom of the router--then the google app will walk you through the rest of the set up.  I literally used the same networ name and password with my previous router, and as a result, I didn't have to reset any passwords with my Amazon Firestick, computer or printer.  Super-easy!!  I like easy.\n\nI live in NYC, and I was annoyed at TWC (now Spectrum), and I had my speed tested, and the guy who did my testing blamed my speeds on the old router I was using (it was literally 10 years old, but it never dropped a signal).  My speed went from 5-15 Mbps download to 100!!!  Wow!!\n\nThis thing actually looks nice, and it came with some cable management ties.  Sure there is the complaint that there is only one ethernet connection and the USB port doesn't really have functionality (I would love to be able to use that for an external hard drive, but I was willing to sacrifice that).\n\nI'm delighted that I got a super-low price on this because it's an older model.  I was hoping that it being older wouldn't mean that it wasn't as good as the newer model.  Other reviews that I read mentioned that this router would be superior to the newer Google Wifi  for crowded NYC apartment buildings because it has more internal antennas.  I've got a big 2 BR apartment with super-thick walls, and my signal is great everywhere.  And the good news is that if you want to use the Google mesh Wifi set up, this is compatible with that.",

                "review_body": "I've had a home network for probably the last fifteen years or so, so I've used a number of routers.  Prior to the OnHub I attempted to use a combination Cable Modem/Router by Arris, mostly for MOCA support for our TiVO.  Before that, I used the Linksys WRT1900AC V1 router with a Motorola cable modem.  With virtually every router thus far, I've had no end of problems keeping my network operational.\n\nI live in a residential area with probably ten to twenty fairly strong local networks around me; a pretty congested situation. Typically, after a week the router would begin dropping connections, making it virtually impossible for any of my family members to remain online with any consistency. No  matter what I did, including changing the router's IP address and frequently changing its channel, they wouldn't go long without failing.  Also, over the years, I've come to expect that any routers I buy will be quickly abandoned by the manufacturer, who will then proceed to stop releasing firmware to fix the problems their rushed-to-market devices would inevitably have.\n\nThus far, though, the OnHub is a dream.  I'm currently three weeks into using the device and I've had nothing but stable connections.  The internet speeds are consistently solid, except when Comcast is on the fritz, and I'm able to stream HD video throughout my house to multiple devices (Roku, Tablets, and Nvidia Shield TV.)  without a hiccup.  The OnHub is ridiculously simple to set up, though I could do without the Close Encounters of the Third Kind spaceship light on top of the unit.  (Thankfully, it's dimmable.)  As others have said, it's not for power users.  It's notably lacking in granular controls for those that really want to tweak their network settings.  Some settings can be found in some of the advanced features in the app, but it's nowhere near as complete as my old WRT or even the Arris.  That's okay, though, because TPLink and Google have automated many of the tasks that I had to configure manually before just to keep the device working properly.\n\nAnd the best part, based on past experience with Google (and not their OEMs), is that I'm the OnHub should receive great follow-up support and regular firmware updates. If you want a rock-solid AC-class router, for the money I can't imagine a better product on the market right now.",

I went through the setup, which was simple and straightforward, then discovered that this router establishes its own subnet.  The result: any (wired) devices you have on your existing network cannot connect with the devices on the wireless network and vice versa.  In other words, this is a great router for those who don't already have any type of router.  We happen to have numerous wired servers: home automation, music, network attached storage, and security cameras, plus some heavy-duty workstations for photo editing and a large format printer.  On the wireless side we have a wireless printer, which is our primary, everyday printer, plus the usual assortment of phones, tablets, laptops, a couple of Amazon Echo devices, some wireless cameras, and a wireless sprinkler controller.  Having the left hand and the right hand unable to communicate was simply absurd, and I was sure I would need to send this back to Amazon.  The Trendnet website was worthless, but I did happen to find the Google web site for the OnHub.  It took some digging, but I finally discovered that it is possible to put this device in \"bridge\" mode, making it look (logically) just like every other wireless router on the market.  Not easy to find, and requires you to actually understand what \"bridge mode\" is, but the iPhone app allows you to switch the device over.  Once done, everything's back on one network and easily addressable.  So far, I've found far better coverage in our large house than any previous router, although there are a bunch I've never tried.  This one will work until the \"next big thing\" arrives.  Plus, Google promises (threatens?) to update this router with new capabilities over time.  Bottomline: shipping a device such as this with no user manual is insulting and arrogant.  Of course, if you've bought any routers in the past, you're used to such behavior from the manufacturers.",

                "review_body": "This is an intelligent router with some unique features. However my experience has been somewhat of a love-hate affair. It's ideal for the less technical since all configuration and setup is done through an Android cellphone. It may not be possible with an iPhone and being a Google product it's doubtful. One of the best features is great U.S. agent phone tech support always available direct from Google. The OnHub is an intelligent router since it determines where to beam the best signal with it's MiMo design and dual band technology. I don't like that there are some limitations to what the user can do to change certain advanced functions but their cellphone app does offer some useful advanced tools. My major disappointment is that although they say that 2 or more OnHubs can be set up in a mesh configuration I was not possible to do so even after spending many hours with their tech on the phone.  He concluded that it wasn't going to work and as a result I had to return my second purchased OnHub. NOTE; I don't think this has been corrected as yet and caution the user about this. Especially since they've now introduced another line of routers that they feature for mesh use. This was very disappointing for me. I am managing with the one OnHub and a range extender for my larger home but have trouble with using both 2.4 and 5 gHz bands. I should also mention that during my failed mesh experience I also had to return my first OnHub after Google tech support finally determined it was not operating right. They did handle all the return including arranging with TP-Link for an advance replacement.  Another annoying limitation is that the user cannot move the OnHub's operating channels. I have a very strong neighbor's router on 2.4 gHz channel 3 and for months the Google router would also remain on this channel causing range issues for me. Google says the router will move to a less occupied channel automatically and it finally did after 6 months! Google can update the hub's firmware automatically but seldom notify the user when thy do so. I found this out by checking with a wi-fi sniffer myself. It is a fast router and their mobile app is useful to see if my internet ISP goes offline wherever I go. Also their app allows me to quickly analyze and inspect my other connected devices remotely. So for now I will remain using the OnHub until something better comes along from Google or another maker. But it seems that Google would rather you buy another newer product than update this hub. I hope this review is useful.",

                "review_body": "I bought 2 of these in January last year (2019) and they were a hassle to set up. Had to spend hours tinkering and calling support until I finally got the mesh network to work. Fast forward to today...I spent 3 hours (literally; thanks screentime analytics) fiddling with the supposedly intuitive app adding another router to the mesh network because my speeds were great everywhere except for my office.\n\nI was following all of the instructions correctly and reading all the google support pages and Reddit forums to try to fix this but nothing worked. I was about to give up until I decided to try to hard reset it one last time and then suddenly, it worked! While I'm relieved it finally worked, it should not have been this much of a hassle to set up.\n\nNot to mention, the only reason I've had to purchase another one of these units is likely due to software-induced slowed speeds and smaller ranges. Everything was working fine before and I was getting 80 Mbps in my home office with just the two routers but without any movements of routers or structural changes, my speeds have slowed down to a whopping 4 Mbps in my office area.\n\nMy guess is Google wants you to buy the new Nest wifi they've put out, so they're slowing down their older products, especially since these routers are going on 6 years old now. I would gladly switch if I could get back the ($200+ I spent on the first two Onhub units and the $75 I spent on this recent one). Maybe those wouldn't be the slow and buggy units these Onhubs have become.\n\n2021 Update:\nBought a fourth router. These work great once you have them setup. However, once again, I spent about two hours trying to add the new router to the network. I was on the verge of submitting a return request before it magically started working. Hopefully I never have to add another point again. Once again, great product with great speeds that penetrate walls easily but such a pain in the butt to setup. Don\u2019t buy this thinking it\u2019s going to be an intuitive setup process. Worth it if you have the patience to get it working though.",

                "review_body": "My spouse said it best,\n\"I can't tell the difference between one set up or another, I only notice an issue if it doesn't work\".\n\nWhen I purchased this device, it wasn't powerful enough to accommodate the entire household with strong Wi-Fi. So, I was using a combination of wireless and over the power internet which was working fine until one of my Monster Powernet devices went bad and had to only rely on my wireless routers to work at the other end of the home. I tried just using the OnHub router in conjunction with an Xfinity X-Fi modem router thatcame with my cable internet service. These two weren't cutting it by themselves and watching glitchy Netflix or failing at loading any 4K signals was a first world brutality during this pandemic. (The Pandemic of 2020 caused by Covid-19 and inept leaders on a federal level to prevent further spread.) I hoped the two routers would just work, but I suspect you know how this story goes. Well, it didn't and I thought now would be a good time to get a Mesh network using the Google OnHub router and buying two more for a strong reliable signal in a home that spans around 1,200 sq. feet. A few months ago, the OnHub application changed but I only had one only one device and now I was setting up 3 devices. End result with 1 device being slightly over a year old and two brand new devices was that it did not work. THE MESH NETORK WOULD NOT CONNECT TO EACHOTHER. With my child being home for school, and the CA bay area air being toxic due to the ongoing fires, internet reliability throughout the house was imperative to our sanity. I am tech savvy and performed factory resets on all devices and even tried linking the devices when the were only inches apart instead of being placed in other rooms to see if it was me or the devices themselves. I am very suspect of planned obsolescence and don't want to accuse a company of anything like that except my Apple products, but with the other models endorsed by Google out, I decided to stop using this device because it could not set up a mesh network for me like I needed. I ended up going with an Orbi set up, which my spouse replied worked better than the set up we had before. There is no worse product review than one of starting all over with another company's competitor product that just works great. Within 5 fee of the router, the wireless signal was fantastic but go into another room with additional devices on the network and you saw jitter in the signal when watching something streaming and buffering. I went with a product that was for performance instead of the cheaper OnHub option, because I need things to just work.\n\nPositives:\nApp capable (easy to use locally or remotely)\nSleek styling\nEasy to use and rename (Mine was named Spyware detected download)\nWorks well for a limited area\nCons:\nIf you stream on multiple devices (its gonna have issues)\nLong load time when coupled with Ring cameras/Nest cameras\nJust didn't work under the conditions of having internet point on one side of the home and needing internet on both sides of the home.\nWould not create a MESH network as advertised",

                "review_body": "I really want to like this router, I'm a huge Google early adopter and have had a variety of Nexus devices so had very high expectations, perhaps too high in fact given this review.\nThe good - it's super easy to set up once you download the app. It seems to handle the large number of devices 12-20 depending what's powered on, though haven't tried streaming several at once to see how it handles that,we're on a 200Mbps connection so could have a lot going at once. I'll do a test and report back on that.\nThe bad - I've been wanting to assign static IP's to a couple of devices that are hardwired via a switch I have connected, but when looking at the network and trying to find which Mac address is assigned to what device, the current UI refreshes the list every time you look at a device then go back. And given 8-10 of my devices are listed as \"unnamed device\", it's a real PITA to go back and forth trying to see what's what on the network. Every other router interface I've used had the Mac address listed in something like a super-view  \"attached devices\" list so you didn't have to bounce back and forth looking for right device.  Given this is a highly upgradable router, I'm hoping - are you listening Google? - that they'll fix this with a update to the UI that will list all devices AND their Mac address on the same page so you don't have to click each attached device to find the Mac.Seems an easy fix.\n\nAdditionally there seems to be a bug - which I reported via the app - that mis-reports your internet connection speed. For example, I'll have the Onhub do a speed test and it comes back will come back with something like 21Mbps down and 20Mbps up as our internet pipeline speed. But I'll run the Ookla speed test from my phone and get 185Mbps download and 22Mbps upload or more reported via that app. I can run the speed test on the Onhub back-to-back several times in a row and never get even close to the same speeds reported, might be 21Mbps one time, 120Mbps next, then 15Mbps after that where as with the Ookla app it's never below 185Mbps download. Obviously I'm getting the throughput I'm paying for from Time Warner, but sure would expect the router to be able to correctly report the connection speed.  Pretty disappointed on that aspect.\n\nOverall, I don't see any real improvement over the Netgear I had before other than the AC wireless, but given I've only got 3 devices (2 phones and a 4K TV) that are AC compatible, I might have jumped the gun a tad getting this. Fingers crossed that Google has an update that fixes the above, if they do I'll revise my review.",

                "review_body": "Summary:  If you want a simple wifi access point (not router) that takes basic internet (with DHCP) on one side and provides simple WIFI, this might be for you.  If you want a simple router for $200 that makes setup easy and is actually likely to be completed successfully by the tech unsavvy, stick with Apples Airport.\n\nI'm an ex-Googler, early adopter, and was quite excited to receive this product from Amazon today.  My former coworkers told me how awesome it was, so I ordered it on faith.\n\nThe unboxing experience was fantastic, the box was well thought out, the labeling, and packaging were all top notch.  The hardware is frankly beautiful, perhaps, impractically shaped, but no more so than the Apple Airport.\n\nSetup:\nIt prompts you to plug in the device, install the Google On app on your phone.  All of that went fine, told me to hold my phone over the Router and it communicated via audio to sync the two devices.  The sync worked flawlessly except for one problem... it requires DHCP.  If your WAN connection doesn't provide DHCP (mine doesn't) you're supposed to be able to bypass setup and go straight to assigning Static WAN settings.  The documentation is wrong, you can't actually do this until _after_ you can connect to the device once.\nSo, I ended up plugging the ON into my airport extreme, letting it DHCP via that and then configuring the static IP.  Unfortunately, the static IP configuration didn't go well.  The app told me (twice) that it saved my configuration.  Unfortunately, when I plugged the ON into my Cable Modem, no DHCP, no lease, no connectivity, fail.  I followed the troubleshooting steps of force killing the ON app, disassociating my Android from all wireless networks and trying again.  This time it worked... static ip configured and it's online.\n\nNow on to the next part... I run a webserver, a couple of POE cameras, a Sling Box, and a couple of other items on my network that require port mappings (and thus static ips).  The On supports static ips, but barely.  You can't add the DHCP configs via Mac address, you can only assign static ips to devices that have connected to the ON via DHCP once.  It doesn't tell you what those devices are, instead it presents you with a list:\n\nUnamed Device\nx.x.x.2\nUnnamed Devices\nx.x.x.3\netc.  I'd have to then login to each device, see which IP it leased and then remap the IPs, huge pain, I'm not going to do that.  Google on fail.\n\nAlso, I have a couple of devices on my network (thermostat) that are client-side static ip'd to 192.168.1.x\nThe On is hard coded to 192.168.86.x.  You cannot change this.\n\nIt took me 15 minutes to configure the On to have a static IP and it took me another 15 minutes (fighting with the android app, wifi connectivity,etc) to get it back to DHCP.\n\nAs it stands now, I bought the On because it's supposed to have awesome wireless connectivity.  So, I'm reduced to using the On as a wifi access point with the airport extreme providing routing, static ips, and port mapping above it in the stack:\n\nModem -> Airport Extreme (Router, wireless disabled) -> Google On\n\nSo, it's currently a $200 wifi access point that only provides a singles SSID (no guest network, no separate a/n network).\n\nGoogle, I'm unimpressed.  As with all of your recent releases, you're declaring that advanced features aren't needed and that you want to simplify peoples lives.  I like the idea in spirit, but in practice, the world (particularly the home networking world) is complex and you need to support a few more things before I will recommend this product to anyone.  You're clearly targeting the tech-unsavvy, and my experience was rough enough that\nI'm going to tell those folks to stick with the Apple Airport for now.\n\nLet me know when you support the things I've mentioned above and I'll consider trying the On again.",

I purchased another one of these for them for the 2020 holidays to add as a mesh Wifi point. It works great once it's set up, the connection is solid.\n\nA note of advice to anyone purchasing one of these in 2021 or beyond:\nBe sure to upgrade the firmware first before adding a newly-purchased OnHub as a mesh Wifi point. Out of the box, any brand-new OnHub purchased today will be running outdated firmware. If you try to set the device up as a mesh Wifi point immediately, the setup will fail. You need to connect an Ethernet cable to the OnHub's WAN port, then set the device up as a NEW Wifi point via the Google Wifi app (you can use any network name you want, as this will be temporary). The firmware on the OnHub will be updated as part of this process (this is crucial). Once the setup is complete, use the \"Factory reset\" option in the app to reset the OnHub (be sure to select the correct one, if you have multiple OnHubs on your network). Wait 5-10 minutes until the device is reset, then go back to the Google Wifi app & select the \"Add Wifi Point\" option. Proceed with the setup to add the OnHub as a mesh Wifi point. You shouldn't run into any issues, as long as the OnHub is running the same (latest) version of the firmware as any other OnHubs on your network.\n\nDocking 1 star for the somewhat tedious setup process, if you plan on using the OnHub as a mesh Wifi point out-of-the-box.",

                "review_body": "I have run my own tech firm (managed service provider) for over 15 years. We deal with about 15% of our customers as residential clients (usually employees of our business clients) or, they are work-at-home entrepreneurs. We're always being asked about what wireless routers to use. From our perspective, the best solution is a wired router plus an access point. The router typically last 2-3x the life of the radios of a good access point. Also, when dealing with a large house (say 3K+sqft) having more than one access point (AP) is suggested for really good wi-fi. So, for the smaller homes, we usually are ambivalent on the choice of a \"wireless router\" because it rarely makes a big difference.\n\nThe Google OneHub solution is an interesting approach for the residential user that doesn't typically employ an IT firm to install and support the wireless.\n\nAs an MSP, we NEVER use the CD or stupid application that comes with a wireless router, to configure it. We simply connect the its web site and configure it. We adjust the network address, the wireless SSID(s) and passwords, and insure the firmware is up to date. The OnHub setup is VERY different.\n\nThe bottom line for this unit is that it ROCKS. If you want more details, read on.\n\nI have an Android phone, but I will assume the IOS setup is the same. On this device, the way you configure it is through your phone. OK, that's different, and you just have to work with that.\n\nThe unit comes with a default SSID, and password. you'll need to enter those after downloading the app and off you go \"configuring the WAP\". The app doesn't let you do much more than decide the SSID (the Wireless network name) and the password. Then it configures it and updates firmware if necessary.\n\nWant to configure the SSID for the 2.4 differently than the 5G network? Don't buy this. But Apple doesn't make this easy either. Why you want to make them different is usually only because you're VERY techie and don't have a device that makes it easy to choose. Bottom line? Don't worry about this and let them have the same name!\n\nThen comes the fun. You have some cool features that will test internet to the WAP, and WAP to your phone. It's mostly eye candy. Oh, how did you set this up? You connect this unit to your wired router. But what you didn't know... is this unit will act like a router as well. Running a house with ONLY wi-fi? Then this unit can be perfect as a wireless router. Already have a router? Well, AFTER it is all configured from the phone app you'll want to visit the Network And Settings section and change the operation to BRIDGE mode. This allows it to operate as a normal, Access point. Can you adjust the IP address of it? Not from the app! Should you care? Not in a home environment.\n\nMy suggestion is to play with all the features and test your speeds before you are ready to flip it to bridge mode. Once there, about 75% of the features and test functions will disappear. There is very little you can configure at this point.\n\nBut speed? Killer. Distance? Superb. Now if it is stable, and remains so for the next several years, this will be the 2017 product of the year.\n\nBuy it!",

                "review_body": "Pros: - The speeds (when they're working as specified) work great. The range I cannot comment on as I don't have a decent enough sized living area to compare with my old router; however, this one does allow all of my devices to attain full transfer and internet speeds most of the time.\n- The visual appeal of this is great. It's simple and more modern than a \"blocky\" router.\n- You can assign static IPs to certain devices.\n- You can utilize port-forwarding to those static IP-set devices.\n- Android App works well, and set up went pretty smoothly.\n- The guest network was easy to set up too: specifically, it was easy to select devices on your primary network to bridge with the guest network for shared access (ie, my chromecast and one of my DLNA servers).\n\nCons: - I was aware when I was getting the device of the one LAN port... that is frustrating, but again, I knew it going in.\n- For some reason, this router repetitively drops signal. Every hour or two when I'm watching Netflix via my X-Box one or surfing via my PC the internet cuts out. This did not happen with my previous TP-Link router. After reboots of all devices and even resets, the OnHub continues to drop service.\n- I cannot select which band to use since both bands are named the same. I have no issue with both bands being named the same, but I think that in scenarios as such where bands are doubly-broadcast that the end-user should be able to select which band to have their device link with primarily (eg, with my Nexus 6P, I would prefer a 5Ghz connection and, when the signal is too low for maintaining a connection, for it to fall-back to the 2.4Ghz connection if available). Again, I don't feel this is a con directly of the OnHub, but since you cannot explicitly distinguish between the bands, connections can get frustrating.\n- Google, Android, Chrome - all of these represent a level of openness, of accessibility, of tinkering. There is absolutely NO tinkering with the OnHub; you are given minimal control over your own network, with the exceptions listed above. I know the device obtains updates on occasion, but the inability for advanced (or non-beginner users, like myself) to alter fixed settings is beyond aggravating.\n- No. Freaking. Web. UI. I'm sorry, I like my phone, but clicking and typing in front of a larger screen really does make things easier. Even if it was accessible on-network only I'd be more content instead of being forced to utilize the app on my phone when I'm utilizing it for other means.\n- Lastly, and I think this may tie in with my connection issue: when I occasionally do a speed test using the app, the results are mixed. My internet speed down is 100mbps, and the network will sometimes offer me that as a result, and other times, it will spit back 40mbps or even 6mbps. This makes absolutely no sense, especially when the rest of the network is asleep and not actively accessing the internet.\n\nOther Thoughts: I purchased this product because the OnHub is serviced by Google, and I chose this model over the other available model by Asus simply because I utilize other TP-Link products with no qualms. Plus the idea of \"waving\" my hand over the Asus OnHub in order to tell it commands just seems like trivial and sort of useless.\n\nOverall, I guess I'm disappointed that I invested in a product that was supposed to provide a sort of superiority to other networking options, especially being backed by a major networking manufacturer tied with the prominence of Google's technological capabilities. I don't feel that this product really is worth the investment; I should have stuck with my inexpensive b/g/n wireless router flashed with DD-WRT which definitely got the job done, if not a little slower than the OnHub, at least consistently and with customization options.",

                "review_body": "ONE YEAR LATER:  Still love this router.  Google added a guest network feature around 6 months ago, and their latest updates allow me to pause access to specific devices (a tactic some use to limit kids' Internet use) and add Google's Wi-Fi mesh network points to the OnHub router.\n\nI did lose one to a dirty power supply in a rental property.  At least I got an automatic alert when the unit died, and re-installation was easy.  Haven't had any problems since.\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:  I just installed OnHub this week to replace an Asus RT-N66U in a rental property.  Setup was stupendously easy, and OnHub now covers more of the property than the Asus ever did.  But I wouldn't put one in my home.\n\nOnHub is perfect for a rental property:\n* Routers often have to be exposed in rentals, since you paste the WiFi SSD (network name) and password to them to make sure guests can log in easily.  OnHub looks good sitting out (though some people may not recognize it as a router).\n* OnHub's easy remote management features (you can manage it from anywhere, not just from the house) let you troubleshoot from a distance.\n* The way OnHub binds to your Gmail address keep renters from pressing factory reset on your router.\n\nOnHub is also great for people (parents!) who just don't want to mess with complex router setups:\n* You get very simple setup, but still get to see what each Internet-using device is doing in your home.\n* You may not be able to boot junior's iPad off the network, but you CAN change the network login and lock everyone out for a while.\n* OnHub should update itself, so you can just smile calmly when one of your technical friends explains how important it is to keep your router firmware updated against Devil's Backside (or whatever they call the next security scare).\n\nIt's not so great that you should pay over retail for it.  Wait until TP-link makes a few more.\n\nInstallation:\n* Install the Google On app first, before you uninstall your existing router (heh, heh).\n* Wrestle OnHub out of its tight-fitting, Tiffany-colored box.\n* Plug it in, start your On app, and...\n* Wait for the inevitable 5-minute update Google seems to include with every one of their devices (Do they not trust their manufacturers with release code?  Are they sadists?  It's a mystery).\n* Wait for the excessive, cartoon-like animations in the On app.\n* Name your network, set your password, and...\n* Good grief!  You're done!\n\nNow you can check in from the office to see if Junior is pulling down YouTube-like quantities of data when he should be bathing, sleeping, doing homework.  Or you can look up the WiFi password from a restaurant to give it to your babysitter.  Or you can just use the Internet and never think about your router ever again.\n\n[THIS PARAGRAPH IS NO LONGER TRUE, SINCE GOOGLE ADDED GUEST NETWORKS TO THIS DEVICE] So why wouldn't I use OnHub at home?  It doesn't allow me to set up a separate a guest network.  This means that when I give a guest my OnHub WiFi password I'm giving them access to my whole home network, instead of giving them just guest network access which would restrict them to Internet access  without letting them into my movies, photo albums, other computers, etc.  Sure, I could use OnHub and lock down all these other systems, but that's more complicated than just managing a guest network on an Asus or other full-featured WiFi router.\n\nOther people object to OnHub's lack of Ethernet ports.  Nice Ethernet hubs are available for $20.  If you like OnHub, get an external hub.\n\nPeople wonder what the speaker does.  Well, it emits one long grunt at setup, and I've heard nothing since.  Maybe Google has plans for this, the Zigbee and Bluetooth and other networking components.  Who cares?  They do nothing now, and the router is good enough to stand on its own.",

                "review_body": "This router is a toy right now. Google clearly didn't test this thing before releasing it. How do I know this with such confidence?\n\nI'm a cable cutter. I have no land line telephone and I don't have a cable set top box. I've been pushing the future of digital media for a decade now.\n\nSo during the setup process the OnHub app, which is supposed to make everything so much easier right?!!? Well it announces: You've done everything right but the OnHub can't get connected to your ISP. Please call XXXXXX or email XXX@XXX for assistance.\n\nOK Google, oops, go back to sleep phone, how do I call your number with a router that can't talk to my ISP? How do I send an email?\n\nNot very well thought out.\n\nAnd everything failed. Hold phone near OnHub so it can hear the secret code. We were unable to hear the secret code, but don't worry you can enter the secret code off the bottom of the OnHub manually! Yeah, type so small on the bottom of the hub I couldn't read it.\n\nAgain: not tested.\n\nWhich reminds me: Hey Google, ever heard of a QR code? Why isn't the download link for the app for iOS and Android on the box as a QR code? Ever heard of N - F - C??? Why didn't y'all blow the $.25 for a simple NFC tag for the URL's and \"secret\" code? I mean you've over charged us $200 for this thing I'd think you could spend $.25 (or free for a set of QR codes) to make things easier right? I mean Google *did* promise this thing was going to be easier.\n\nSo so far: empty promises and the technology was so easily at hand to have done *much* better.\n\nFortunately I've written a complete TCP/IP stack in Intel x86 assembly language so I *was* qualified to diagnose what was wrong at each stage and after repeating many steps multiple times I was able to get the OnHub online. Thank goodness for those days slaving over a hot x86 assembler.\n\nFinal result: my Mom would have given up after the thing couldn't whisper the secret code and her not able to read the infinitesimally sized secret code off the bottom of the unit. So: EPIC FAIL on easy peasy installation.\n\nAt this point the true toy nature of this device is fully revealed.\n\nIt assumes you are a complete idiot and won't let you adjust anything. Well my previous 8 routers would at least let me set the LAN IP address. I've got several devices on my LAN with static IP's, none of which now work because Google thinks I'm too stupid to be able to set my LAN IP address.\n\nWhat I am is stupid for buying something that treats me like I'm stupid.\n\nSo first feedback item: are you stupid? If you aren't: don't buy this device because it thinks you are dumber than a sack full of hammers.\n\nThink I judge it too harshly? Well, here's the second EPIC FAIL.\n\nIt only configures one SSID. I read in the reviews vague comments about how the OnHub would \"redirect\" devices to 5 GHz. Well my state-of-the-art 15\" Macbook Pro Retina with 802.11ac that was getting close to 900Mbps on the previous AC1900 router? It's now getting 316Mbps because it's hooked up 802.11n 2.4GHz!!! And since I'm dumber than a sack full of hammers: there is no ability to fix this! No buttons etc.... I'm just stuck with 1/3rd the performance I had before I installed this supposed marvel of simple setup and use router.\n\nQuite frankly: I think it's going back in the box and back to Amazon tomorrow because I can't handle a device so stupid it hooks up my 802.11ac laptop as 802.11n 2.4GHz!\n\nOther issues? My previous 8 routers have all had 4 ethernet ports to hook up stuff. So my HP Color Laser Printer is presently off the network because it has no ethernet jack to plug into. What is that you say? Hook the Color Laser up to the USB 3.0 jack on the OnHub? Nope, the USB 3.0 port is only used for \"rescue mode\" recovery of the OnHub when it's firmware gets fried. You can't use it to hook up your printer or a disk drive.\n\nFor $200 I would have thought 4 LAN jacks and Printer/Hard drive support on the USB jack would have been standard. You picking up on the common thread here? Google thinks I'm dumber than a sack full of hammers so they don;t include the ethernet jacks and USB features every other $200 wifi router comes with and thus thinks I won't notice. Hey Google: I noticed! I'm sitting here with an ethernet jack for my printer and no place to plug it in like I had with my previous 8 routers!\n\nSo here I sit, most of my wired devices not working, *all* of my 3D printers are offline, and I mean I don't even have my simple HP color laser printer up! What a complete lame joke Google! I haven't been this disconnected by setting up a router in EIGHT GENERATIONS of supposedly STUPID HARD TO CONFIGURE ROUTERS! And y'all tell us what we needed was a simple to setup router to make our lives easier? Really?!!?\n\nI'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1 because if you are dumber than a sack full of hammers and have the eye sight of an eagle and the patience of a saint during the setup, willing to repeat steps over and over and over again and you've never ever setup a wireless router before in your life and all you have is an 802.11n laptop and an android phone capable of Wifi Calling: this device is for you eg two stars because it *might* actually be useful to someone out there.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nAfter 24 hours the router still hasn't figured out how to speak 802.11ac to my Macbook Pro. I thought people got frustrated because their routers wouldn't work correctly and you got slow connections or no connection and Google was solving all that with this router. But instead I've taken a big step backwards from everything was working and now I've got a router that so clever it won't even let me give it direction when it gets things wrong. I've printed out the return label and it's going back. Maybe Google will at some point actually make this thing deliver on it's promise of trouble free wireless networking but for now I need my 802.11ac back on. Buh bye OnHub.\n\nAnd *thank you Amazon* for making it easy to send this turkey back.",

                "review_body": "Simply stated: OnHub is the best router ever to anchor my home network. Beauty, simplicity, availability, and extensibility are OnHub\u2019s defining characteristics. Sold in blue or black enclosures, the thing is gorgeous, and it feels as solid as it looks. Setup and maintenance are frightening for their ease. The usable wireless range far exceeds the Apple AirPort Extreme router that OnHub replaces in my home. The network device packs protocols and other features you won\u2019t need now but will want later on.\n\nI have never wanted to put a router in the living room more than OnHub. Sigh, but my Cox cable connection is in a back room, so this gorgeous tech doesn\u2019t get the attention deserved. I bought the blue model, simply because Amazon had that one in stock. But I must say the color compliments my Nexus 6 nicely (not that it matters\u2014okay, I lie). Photos do nothing to capture OnHub\u2019s beauty. You need to see the device close up and handle it to appreciate the design.\n\nReminiscent of Google\u2019s failed-to-launch Nexus Q, a luminescent ring around the top accents the device. The feature is functional by using color to denote network status\u2014blue for setup, teal for active and online, and amber for trouble. While bright, the colors are also muted so that they don\u2019t overly illuminate a darkened room (that\u2019s in the default setting; the light\u2019s brightness can be increased).\n\nDuring setup the enclosure twists off, allowing easier access to the four ports on the back: Power, LAN, WAN, and USB 3.0. There is but one LAN port, supporting Gigabit Ethernet, which might put off some people. OnHub is built for a wireless world, where cloud connectivity means everything. If you need more than one network port, buy something else.\n\nTo set up OnHub you download either the Google On Android or iOS app to your smartphone and connect the router cables to power and ISP modem (via the WAN port). This is where the other-world experience begins. The app prompts to place your phone over the top of OnHub, which emits a tone that establishes a secure connection. A Google account is required for extensible cloud and security features; to be discussed later. The last step is to name your network and assign a password.\n\nSimplicity extends to manageability and the ways which the Google On app lets you see what\u2019s going on across your network. Like OnHub, the app is pretty, and it is intuitively functional. You can even manage more than one Google router. That\u2019s handy for the small business owner with several OnHubs in different locations or someone who owns one at home and sets up another for, say, aged parents.\n\nManageability simplicity goes further, like the ease of conducting a \u201cnetwork check\u201d for connectivity from modem to ISP, from OnHub to modem, and from device to router. Overall bandwidth usage or that by device is a touch-tap away, as well.\n\nYou can read a longer version of this review with photos on my personal site: http://joewilcox.com/2015/09/22/google-onhub-review/",

                "review_body": "I purchased this router as a recommendation from my ISP tech support. My current ISP router is located in the kitchen on one side of a 2 story home. Therefore, the signal on the second floor devices max at 3 bars. So, I decided to try the OnHub. The signal was marginally better on the second floor as the devices went from 3 to 4 bars.\n\nThe device was somewhat easy to set up using the Google WiFi app. The updates was taking a long time to complete and kept installing for almost an hour although the app said it should take 15 mins. I eventually stopped it and restarted the connection process which went a lot faster. Once the router was active, I disabled the WiFi on the ISP router. Then, I changed the name and password on the OnHub to match what I already had. Once saved, all my devices connected to the OnHub automatically which I liked so I wouldn't have to manually do it. The WiFi app has very limited advance features and it gets even worse if you migrate the setup into the Google Home app. Unfortunately, that migration is irreversible. You can see all devices and change priority. You can't switch between 2.4 & 5Ghz. There were several times my Note 9 was running slow because it was on 2.4Ghz. I had to turn the WiFi on/off for it to reconnect to 5Ghz.\n\nI already knew what my speed test #s were with the ISP router so I immediately did a speed test in the Google app and found the results were approx 450Mbps up/down when a few feet away and 350Mbps up/down on the second floor. I have 500/500 internet service. However, when I did a speed test using a different app, the numbers dropped to approx 300Mbps a few feet away and 200Mbps on the second floor which are the same results I would get from the ISP router. I realized the Google app speed test is highly inaccurate and adds more Mbps than it is actually delivering. I ran the test multiple times from different areas around the house and the Google app was always higher which seemed odd.\n\nI used the router for about a month to really gauge if it was worth keeping. I didn't have any disconnection issues but I did have some occasional website loading errors due to the DNS server. This happened with websites I use frequently with no problem prior to having the OnHub. I didn't notice anything better/different with speed on my smart devices compared to the ISP router.\n\nAfter doing some additional research, I realized a mesh system may provide better coverage in my home. I think the OnHub may be good for a smaller 1 story home. So, I returned it and will look at mesh WiFi options instead.\n\nUPDATE 3/11/2021: I recently found out that the OnHub now has the capability of being a mesh system which it didn't at the time I purchased back in December 2020. I tried the Google WiFi and Deco systems and it didn't work that great. So I purchased four OnHubs to cover my entire home. Two on the ground floor and two on the second. It still gives out a little under half of my 500/500 internet speed. If I'm nearby the router I could get a little above half but now I at least have full signal on the second floor. I also purchased an Ethernet switch to connect multiple devices since the OnHub only has one extra port. All have been working out pretty good.",

                "review_body": "Google just might be on to something good.  This wireless router is more than just good looking.  The set up was easy and done in just a few minutes.  All my devices connected except for an old Toshiba Blue Ray player.  I used the former network ID and password and the blue ray did not want to switch to the new IP address.  It kept the IP address from my former Apple Extreme router.  No big deal since have Roku and never used the blue ray internet apps anyway.  Updates haven't occurred in over a year anyway.  To correct this, just have to restore the router to factory settings and change the network ID.  If you want to connect equipment more than a few years old, there may be issues.  May avoid problems by not using prior network ID.\nWhile checking the connection speed noted does not have IPv6.  Just IPv4.  Called tech and appears not something I need anyway.  Software update in the future may add this.\nThe USB port is not set up to accommodate a printer.  That is a problem being all ports used on the iMAC.  This is also not big deal since this was the 3rd printer hooked up anyway.  Appears router was engineered to support predominately wifi connections.  It would be nice if had more ports.\nI have the iMAC on wireless and am using the ethernet port for NetTalk.  It works great.\nThe signal strength and speed is comparable to the Apple Extreme.  Using Comcast with download 124 and upload 12 in same room as router.  When 40 ft away through multiple walls speed does drop by up to two thirds on iPhone.  iPad seems to have faster speeds at same distance. The 4K TV has fluid signal at 55 and no pauses or delays about 100 ft from router.\nNot sure what purpose the Bluetooth has on the router.\nIn all, pleased with the routers operation.  Just wish had more ports so I could hook up all my equipment that was accomodated on the Apple Extreme.\nWould like to see how this router compares to the new Tri-Band units which I hear are not yet bug free.\nI was able to snag it for the list price of $200 on Amazon.  Today I see that it is out of stock.  Units are available at inflated third party sellers prices.  Rip off!\nSeems to be very popular item.\nI recommend giving this router a try.  If does not work out,  Amazon has excellent return policies.",

                "review_body": "I have to say that this is the best router I've ever used, within the last two years I've tried different routers and I will compare those to this one.\n\nNow, everyone's results will be different depending on where you live, I live in NYC where there is a lot of interference such as taxi companies, the 6 train, the many wires and antenna's and everyone and their mother who have routers.\n\nNow, my first router that I fell in love with was the Apple AC Router, which was my favorite for some time, I hardly had to reboot it, it had great range and at the time of me owning it hardly no one in my area was using the 5ghz band. Then when everyone started using that band I needed to get an extender as more interference started hurting my signal. Then when I renovated my kitchen and changed all of my lighting to LED bulbs (which significantly hurt router range) I knew it was time to buy a more \"powerful\" router.\n\nSo after much searching and review reading I was one of the dumb people who ignored the many negative reviews on the Netgear Nighthawk X6. I thought this was going to be what I needed, the Holy grail of routers... yeah right, this had to be the worst router I've ever used. Had to reboot it 2 to 4 times every other day, had to deal with horrible customer service who always pretended to have never heard of the issues, the very weak 2.4ghz band, the horrible unstable 5ghz... wasted money on two Netgear extenders, Netgear sent me another X6 and was the same exact problem. Then they sold me at a major discount the X10 which I now retract my statement of the X6 being the worst router as the X10 in fact was the worst of them all....\n\nI finally couldn't take it any more,  I knew I was tired of the rebooting, the changing this or that setting or doing the 30 30 30 reset that Netgear always suggests....\n\nAfter reading so many reviews I ended up buying the Google wifi, which I loved and which smoked the above mentioned routers, great range, the mesh system is beyond amazing as I did not have to switch into the extended as the mesh system just simply switched over on its own... however, as perfect or close to perfect the Google router is, it was only giving me 70 percent of my paid for speed... and believe it or not I was fine with that for a while. Because I never had to reboot. Great and strong signal but then it started to bother me, so I figured let me test out the onhub due to the many antenna's that it has, and Bingo, this was the one for me... I have the speed I get, the signal is perfect and I have not once had to reboot...\n\nI miss the beautiful look of the Google wifi, but this is beautiful as well...\n\nThis router is the perfect router for me, I have all of my gadgets on it, my son and my daughter and wife have their things connected as well and not one hick up.... all of us on the weekend stream HD movies and TV shows and not one issue.... also, what I noticed with the Google routers is that everything connects right away, with the Netgear routers it took close to 30 seconds before anything connected to it, not sure why....\n\nHands down this is the best router for me and for my area...\n\nSo if you hate rebooting almost everyday, always having to manually change the channels, always having to change this or that or bend this antenna or move this or that, then this is the router for you....",

                "review_body": "I've had this for a couple days - not sure if I'll keep it.\nIt was very easy to set up. The app and onhub do really play well together. I thought that my setup was successful and easy. Unfortunately, I later found out devices weren't working nearly as well as I'd assumed.\nProblem 1 - I run a Plex server on my laptop.\nI quickly found that neither of my Rokus could find the Plex server. However, my android tablet could find it, and still played videos. I had no idea why one wireless device worked and 2 others didn't.\nNote: This all worked fine before taking down my old router and putting the onhub in place. Since the Onhub provides exactly no information about configuration, it's nearly impossible to troubleshoot. For example: the onhub moves devices between 5ghz and 2.4ghz on its own. It doesn't tell you anything about what it's decided, and that's not cool. I did call Google's onhub support. They had no idea how to help, though they were very nice.\nI lucked out and found that when I rebooted the onhub, and every device I had, the Rokus magically could find the Plex server. Ooookay....\n\nProblem 2) I keep having to reboot the onhub to make devices work.\nI got home yesterday and tried to use my android tablet. The tablet said it was connected to my SSID.\nHowever, I had no connection, and couldn't use the internet. I rebooted a few times, turned wifi on and off, and removed and rejoined the network. All to no avail. The onhub app on the tablet COULD connect directly to the onhub, but only after opening and closing it a few times. The onhub app itself would open and then fail, saying I had no wifi connection - even though the tablet showed I was connected. On reopening the app, it changed its mind, and let me see the onhub network map, and run a network test - which worked - but indicated I needed to connect my device to wifi to test its speed. I dont even understand how that's possible - to be connected and not at the same time. Again, I rebooted the onhub, and everything was ok.\n\nProblem 3) My laptop is randomly saying it's got limited connectivity, which a reboot does not fix. Only rebooting the onhub fixes it. Also, the laptop is reporting that there's an IP conflict with another device on the network. How that's possible, other than a failure on the onhub's part to hand out IPs, I have no idea.\n\nSo, unless google support has a quick fix for all this annoying crap, I'm going back to my 50 buck old D-link router, and I'll return this thing.\n\n*UPDATE*\nGoogle support has made no response. Returning. My home network doesn't function with this thing. Putting my old cheap router back in place, which at least works. Sorry Google, try harder.",

                "review_body": "This router is amazing!  It took me about 30 mins to set up 2 of them in a mesh config.  I now have full strength Wi-Fi throughout the whole house.  I have Verizon FiOS and my previous Wi-Fi Setup was a Verizon Quantum Gateway (AC1750 modem/router) and a LynkSys AC1750 Range Extender.  I had endless problems with this setup, starting with the the fact that it was really 4 networks (2 x 2.4GHz and 2 x 5GHz).  I have a lot of devices in the house and no one ever knew which network to choose the get the best connection.  After installing the 2 OnHubs in the Mesh config, I have only one network and it works very well.  For those wondering if this works with FiOS, the answer is yes.  Here's what I did for my new setup:\n\nI have Internet and TV (no DVR's) from Verizon.  As such, I did not need to keep the Verizon Gateway in the network.  If you do have DVR's, and/or want the channel guide on your TV service, you will have to include the Verizon Gateway in your network (go to dslreports.com or youtube to see how).  I also have the signal from the OTN (outside Verizon box) to the Gateway coming in over Ethernet.  If yours comes in over Coaxial cable, you will need to have Verizon switch it (if you are taking the Gateway out of the network).  This can be done over the phone if you run your own Ethernet cable.  Just call the Verizon FiOS support line and ask them to switch your internet from Coax to Ethernet. If you want them to run it, that will require a service call. Before you start, install the Google WiFi App from Google Play or the App Store onto your mobile phone.\n\nSteps I took to set these up:\n\n1) Release the IP on the Verizon Gateway before turning it off. Click on My Network icon, then select Network Connections item. Click on Broadband Connection (Ethernet) in the table to see the properties for your WAN port. Write down the MAC address for the ethernet WAN port, you may need it later. Scroll down and click Settings. Click the Release button, then Apply.  Your internet light will go Red.\n\n2) Immediately unplug the Verizon Gateway.  If you leave it plugged in, it will Reacquire the IP Address from Verizon and you'll have to do step 1 again.\n\n3)Unplug the Ethernet from the Verizon Gateway WAN port and plug it in to the WAN port on your OnHub.  Plug in the power for the OnHub. It will boot up and the light on the top will flash blue.  Now to the Google WiFi App and follow the instructions.  The OnHub will update its firmware (this enable the Mesh Networking) and set up the OnHub.\n\nAt this point you will have Wi-Fi set up and running on the OnHub.\n\nIf you have a second unit that you want to use in a Mesh setup, unplug the first OnHub from the power and WAN, then plug in the second OnHub and connect it to your internet Ethernet WAN cable.  Set it up as a separate network.  This will cause it to update it's firmware.  After it's updated, unplug the WAN cable and perform a factory reset.  After that, unplug it and set it aside.  Plug the first unit back in to power and the WAN cable.  This will enable the first network you created.  Test it using the app.  After that, plug the power into the second OnHub, but not the WAN.  Now use the app to add a WiFi Point. The App will find the second OnHub and set it up as a WiFi Point.  You can then move it to where you want it in the house.  Your coverage will be excellent.  If you have Ethernet running between your router site (OnHub 1) and the WiFi Point (OnHub 2), you can connect them via Ethernet cable.  This enables wired backhaul, which gives faster speeds between them.\n\nThe OnHub does only have one GigE port on the unit.  I needed more, so I bought aTP-Link 8 port GigE Switch.  I plugged it into the LAN port on the back of the OnHub, then plugged in my wired devices.  They all work fine.\n\nIf you've been frustrated with your Wi-Fi, I strongly recommend this router.  It's easy to set up and just works!\n\nOne last note: Google is now selling \"Google Wi-Fi\" in single or 3 packs.  Those are AC1200.  The OnHub, although older, is AC1900 and has better hardware.  They both use the same firmware and the same app.  The OnHub is a much better buy at this point.",

                "review_body": "First, the Google, On Hub does everything it says and possibly more. I was skeptical and hesitant to purchase this router because I consider myself a bit more advanced than your average residential user. I am a CCNA and like to manipulate my router settings to make it more difficult for intruders to gain access, as well as run several programs that require port forwarding and NAT/PAT settings to be set in other than normal fashions. The description didn't get into as many details so I was weary that I was paying a lot for a router with less functionality than the cheaper, (or other brands to be fair, as the Linksys router I replaced was about the same price.) Upon downloading the On App and looking through the settings, I was a bit disappointed to find I don't have as much control over things as I would have liked... A few calls to customer service, (which is just amazing!,) and I found that despite not being noted in the description, and not being very clear in the application settings, the Google On Hub does in fact support and have the capability to do many of the things I want to do. The only complaint I have, (to date,) is the inability to create your own LAN IP Addressing scheme.\n\nSecond, I was shocked to see how fast and professional the On Hub support team is. Messing around in the advanced settings, trying to configure some things and having a bit of difficulty because of the new platform, (On app as opposed to the Router settings screen on most residential routers,) led to a bit of frustration at first. I prefer to figure things out on my own and hate having to contact customer support, so i messed around for a bit searching for the areas that provided the settings I was looking for with not too much luck. The rest of the platform and the router itself seemed as capable and more reliable than any other I have had so I was reluctant to send it back and insistant on finding the settings I was looking for. After a day of fiddling with the app and feeling like what I was looking for may not be available, i decided to try the help screen. Well, am I glad I did!! Putting in a help ticket and requesting a call back gets you a call within 1 minute! That's the first shocker. The rep on the call had read the ticket, understood my issue and guided me through the app, (while on the phone,) to the exact place I needed to be. I put in a few tickets to customer support over the next couple days regarding setting up static IP's, port forwarding, changing IP addresses and other things. I am simply amazed at how well the support team handles requests and how painlessly easy it is to get support. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a new wireless router based on their support alone!\n\nFinally, the reason I made the switch is because of wireless reliability issues I was having in my home. I don't think I have a large home by any means. It's a 2000 square foot, two story town home. I have lived in a home that was 4500 sq/ft and hadn't experienced any issues. That was leading me to believe that the new router I purchased for my home just wasn't living up to the job. I have many devices including an echo, 5 Sonos components, some GE Link bulbs and many Smartthings outlets, switches sensors and motion detectors. I thought perhaps that the complexity of my network was causing the issues. I would lose connectivity with my Smarthings hub from time to time and Sonos had been acting up for a little while as well. It seemed like anytime another person showed up, and added their phone to my wifi, i would get more connectivity issues. After connecting and configuring the on hub, I have had no issues, what-so-ever with any device on my network. The scheme has remained the same despite not needing some of the additional components I had set up for my previous router. (I had attached an additional router on the second floor of the home to boost my wireless range and take some stress off the main router.)\nIn Conclusion, the On Hub has replaced two routers and provides a strong, uninterrupted signal throughout my home, with all components. It's fairly simple to install, it looks good and is supported by some very professional and knowledgeable staff. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a wireless solution for small business or home.\n\nPros: Looks great, reliable, fairly user friendly interface and SUPERIOR customer service.\n\nCons: Not yet able to manage LAN IP Settings as with other residential routers. Which, BTW, after contacting support regarding this and a few other matters, they did advise they've been asked about by many people calling in for help and have put in a request letting the powers that be know, people are interested in this capability. They made no promises, but did mention a firmware update in the future may add that functionality.",

I had to buy the newer Nest router to replace it and ever since then, the points randomly drop out of the system every 1 - 2 days, and you have to reset them to get them to work again. I even bought a newer Nest point to see if that was the issue, but I have the same problem with it. If you search the Internet for this issue, you will find lots of people have it, and Google support cannot fix it. I finally decided to cut my losses and change systems.",

If you have a router from your service provider, be prepared to be a tech head to get this installed.  Century Link makes me jump through hoops to put their system in \u201cbridge\u201d mode, so it is still there but not really functional.  The bad: the points drop randomly.  The router still has over 800 Mbps when one drops, but randomly and during important conference calls, expect others to have to wait a minute or two at least during the call.  Testing the mesh says it is great at both points, and it is not just one point, but both randomly stop (while the router and other point continue to work great).\n\nSux.

Instead of having each band as a separate network you can connect to, the router will force every device to use 5 GHz if it is in range, then switch to 2.4 GHz if it leaves that range. This becomes a nightmare if you have smart devices that can only use 2.4 GHz.\n-Only one ethernet port (aside from the one you connect to your modem), so if you intend to run multiple wired connections, you have to connect it to a network switch or an additional router.\n-The wifi is now dying every week and that's why I'm upset enough to write a review and start looking for a new router. Unplugging this router for a solid 10 minutes seems to do the trick, but I have to keep doing this every week, sometimes more. When I go to power cycle the router, it's hot to the touch, which may be why the wifi is failing. It's only been 6 months and the router is now a hot egg that only half-works.",

While the set up of the network seemed to go fine, none of my wifi products were connecting.  Enter Google phone support.  Those folks are excellent.  It took awhile to figure out the issue but persistence on the part of Google support paid off and it's all fine now.\nCoverage is amazing. Detached shop, backyard, front yard, attic, it's all covered. 3/4 of an acre of land and house, covered!  And the speed....holy cow!  My speeds have doubled.  Down load is running in the 800's and uploads are in the 700's.\nInteresting to note that many of my connected devices were migrated over to the new wifi coverage automatically.  The one that gave me the hardest time...my Nest thermostat.  Go figure.\nReally like that each point can be used independently of each other if you wish for things like stream music or together for the same purpose.\nI should also note that I had tried various wifi extenders, all to no avail.

They all cost about $ 250 on Cyber Monday Sale except for the  TP Link S4 mesh which costs about $ 180. I got the best overall result with the Google Nest system in terms of speed and it had better product features too. However I found all mesh systems including the Google Nest overstate the area they cover. All the configurations I tried claimed over 5000 to 6000 sq ft of coverage but in my 3000 sq ft single level home, I got good coverage and speeds in half the house, about 1500  sq ft, and much lower speeds in the remainder 1500 sq ft which is further away. The Google Nest mesh though it is not a WiFi 6 technology like the eero 6, did better than others by about 20 % when measured in terms of download speeds, and it\u2019s built in speaker in 2 of the three pods gives it added functionality as a home theater system which the others did not have. The eero provided a more uniform speed than the Nest but it\u2019s top speeds were lower. Both the eero and the Nest mesh systems have smart hub functionality but neither works with third party devices which work only on 2.4 MHZ bands such as Garage door openers. Overall, I think the Google Nest mesh is the better entry level mesh but not by a great deal. The others were almost as good with minor differences and the TP Link was less expensive and only slightly less powerful than the eero 6.",

However, I think having multiple router's is important if you wanted to plug in a desktop PC via ethernet to one of your extra router's acting as an extender. This would hopefully give that desktop PC maximum wireless router speeds through it's own ethernet port. Useful for non-wireless computers (by choice, broken wifi adapter, or old pc)",

They were familiar with all the trouble caused by Netgear.  The woman was great, knew what to do and added the Netgear router MAC number manually to the backend of their system to approve it or something.  It seemed like it was working when I did a test search on Google.....but then no websites would load and my phone could not connect to the internet with out Netgear requiring me to sign up for an account.  I called their tech support and he said there is no way except to sign up for an account.  I was pissed, but too lazy to return this and buy a new one, so I set up a junk email just to let Netgear farm my data.  Can't comment on the router quality, but would not recommend just on the principle of the matter.",

Well, another 20 minutes later, wifi dropped and internet dropped. So I used the browser to check the status of the router, and it would not connect at all. After an hour of working on it (restarting and resetting), i made several changes to the set up, and router worked. It didn't drop wifi signal and it didn't drop the internet. Until yesterday, 02/15/2022 (three days later), I woke up and internet was dropped. I have done everything to re-establish internet connections but the router didn't want to connect. I plugged the modem directly into my computer, and i had instant internet connection. Well, plugged my old router back, and I was up and running. I am sending this product back because it only caused me headaches.",

This router had a really good rating and it seemed to be a good step up. Bought this  April 30 2021. Installed the router with no issues.  Had good wifi signals as well. When it worked, it worked great. However, after using it a couple of months, it decided to drop the internet. Put it back to factory settings.  Still no go. Had to put the previous router back on.  I kept switching out the routers hoping the newer one would work long term. About a month ago, I called customer support (even though I was out of warranty).  Customer support worked with me for at least half an hour - kudos for that!  Factory reset was done again.  However, since it was out of warranty and it too long ago purchased from Amazon, I was stuck with it working or not.  It worked for about 3 weeks and then it stopped working again. We are back to the previous router.  I am in the market for another router and it won't be this one.",

Third, the firmware is so shabby and prone to bitrot that you'll have to restart the router at least once a week to prevent your network traffic from slowing to a halt. Fourth, there is some issue with DNS and this router which causes DNS queries to routinely take > 1,000 ms to resolve.\n\nI bought this router as a quick bandaid when my other \"prosumer\" router fell off the wall and broke and had nothing but trouble with my home network until I was able to get a replacement router from the same \"prosumer\" company.\n\nDo yourself a favor and shop for something else.

You can\u2019t set up with your iPhone though because that would be too secure, you have to have an android or PC. Whatever, we got the laptop out and set up a stupid account so they could most likely farm out our data. That was about 1 1/2 hours right there.\n\nThen we set it up and get it rolling but it apparently won\u2019t cover the square footage of our house. This advertises it will cove 2400 sq ft. Our house is 1600 sq ft. The old router (also a crapgear NightHawk) covered 1500 sq ft. And worked all the way through the house in the exact same spot we set up the new one. The support woman was (surprised) outsourced in another country and had no idea what she was doing, extremely rude, and wouldn\u2019t listen to what our issues were. She asked the same questions 20 different times and obviously had a script that she wasn\u2019t capable to deviate from.\n\nTotal waste of time and money. We are returning ASAP and we will be upgrading to an ASUS AX 3000\n\nDo not use this company! After 90 days you have to pay for technical support as well!",

I already get too many advertising emails. They have increased since getting this unit.) I could not get it to work and had to call Tech Support. Don't waste your time on that. After being on hold for 45 minutes, I finally talked with someone who had me go through the steps I had already done through the app. Their final answer, it is defective. News flash-it wasn't. After disconnecting from Tech Support and going through another setup, I was able to get it to work.

It would not let me bypass creating an account to use the device page.  This is not spelled out on the product page that an account is REQURED,  When I try to go to the network setup page, it redirects me to their site, rather then let me see the products UI.  I will buy another product that doesn't require this, or build my own.  But to be forced into providing information that can then be turned around and used to gain access to my network.... NO.\n\nNetgear CAN NOT provide a guarantee that the data I give would never be sold, nor their network hacked and the data stolen.  They can not because it's not possible.  The only way to guarantee that data not get out is not to give it to them to begin with.  You can't have stolen what you don't have.  They are not giving me that option.... so, I am no longer a NetGear customer, and I am now going to remove our NetGear products from the rest of our network.  That may not matter to them, that's fine.  So what's one customer?  But for those users out there who get hacked.... Well, you can't rule this out now, and if something happened, they wouldn't tell you.  What does a network device company need with my personal data to my core network device anyway?

Quite happy with the Nighthawk purchase so far.\n\nThis router sends out 2 Wi-Fi networks: a 5G network and a normal one.  The 5G sends out a faster speed but to a smaller area, so if you are having trouble with slow speeds or disconnects, check to see if you are on the regular network (which covers a larger area.)  Netgear also asks you to use a mobile device to install the router, but there is an option to install the router if you don't have one available.  Setup was not difficult.  So far, so good. Thanks!",

The first issue was my understanding.  This NETGEAR R7350 was replacing a more complex Netgear router that had a mechanical failure of the power in socket.  I assumed (bad idea) that I would just address it as one does with other routers but quickly discovered NETGEAR wants to push their APP on you for installing and setting up.  That leaves one with several unanswered questions that do not appear in the FAQ.  A phone call to NETGEAR promised a long wait for someone to talk to so I didn't go that route.  Finally, I enlisted the help of my neighbor who is quite smart at this stuff and she had it running properly in no time.  My issues are not about how well it works but about how the instructions make a lot of assumptions as to the knowledge of the new owner.",

Little did I know doing this Firmware Update from the Nighthawk app actually messes up the Firmware, causing the Router to STOP WORKING. Power cycling the router doesn't work, nor does doing a factory reset of the router.\n\nThankfully with Amazon I was able to do a quick router exchange.\n\nThe second NIGHTHAWK router I got, I was able to install with relatively little issue now that I know NOT to do a Firmware Update from the app. I was able to even have proper Wi-Fi for a few days. After after taking vacation for a weekend, I walk home and INTERNET WAS RANDOMLY NOT WORKING.\n\nIt seemed to be a NIGHTHAWK issue, so I tried to do maintenance through the Nighthawk app as well as on a browser maintenance tab. I tried power cycling the modem and router and made sure all the proper ethernet cables and such we're still plugged in. I had an old Apple router I still had as backup, and the Wi-fi was working on that.\n\nI then proceeded to ragequit, and return this second Nighthawk router. I don't plan on getting on Netgear router or heck maybe even other products from them.\n\nDespite the low score I will give a few positives\n\n-The Nighthawk app is actually pretty nice, nifty, and quick. Just too bad the product itself sucks\n\n-When you can actually get in contact with support, the people are nice and helpful. The problem is, by far the fastest way is through online chat on Netgear's site, and sometimes it can be \"Too busy\" so you can't access them. Attempting to contact them by Phone and E-mail takes forever, though that's just common with any popular brand I guess.\n\nTLDR: Router setup has sensitive SOFTWARE BREAKING BUGS. I'm decently knowledgeable on tech, and a person who doesn't know how internet works will likely hate routers if they tried to use this.",

First of all, connect and configure the router offline - that is, not connected to the internet via your cable modem - using the typical 192.168.1.1 gateway address and credentials supplied with the unit.  Once configured you can connect the WAN port.  Any time you need access to the configuration simply disconnect the WAN, log in, and reconnect.

They basically hold you hostage until you get to the part where you are offered extended support for a price. There is no clear decline option. It\u2019s either buy plan A or B. You have to make a decision before your router will work. Trying to figure out how to decline or if you  can even decline,  I \u201cFINALLY\u201d noticed a black X in the upper right corner of the web page. I hit the X and the page disappeared and a new page greeted me with \u201cyou are now done,  your WiFi will now work\u201d. I think the only reason for doing that is to strong arm you into an extended plan. Never experienced a set up process like that before.",

I was given no reason to not trust them other than I wasn't expecting to incur any pc issues for the install.  So far, I have no complaints but I have 1 yr of tech support if needed.

Yes, such a management strategy makes sense for less/non technical consumers who just want a fast device that's easy to set up and have no further desire or need to dig into the low-level configuration. Those same consumers also tend to not care about the privacy they're giving up as long as the convenience of the product is above average.\n\nHowever, for tech enthusiasts and network professionals, there is NO excuse to prevent us from disabling online management and strictly using the built-in management console...despite the limited functionality it surfaces...which is exactly what Netgear has done. It's a shame they have been so blatantly obtuse and hostile on this subject because this router is an exceptional piece of hardware otherwise, with outstanding wired and wireless performance. I'll likely keep it on my network in AP mode, but will be replacing its current role with a router that leaves me in control of both the device and the data on my private network.\n\nThat said, it's relatively easy, but annoying, workaround for the local admin console forcing netgear account creation/login. Using a browser plug-in like ublock origin or a network security appliance like pi-hole,  block accounts.netgear.com. When the admin console attempts to redirect you during login, it will fail and present a Try Again button. Click it. Repeat this process 3 times and you'll be given a \"Try again later\" button. Clicking it will allow you into the local device admin panel. Unfortunately you'll have to do this every time you need access to the device, including when a current session expires, so it gets annoying fast. Better than nothing but it should not be this way.",

After any changes are made, make sure you are logged in, connect the WAN port back, then press TEST under the internet tab once connected to your modem.\n\nEDIT for dropped WIFI signals:\nThe wifi will quit about 2-3 times a day when using only the 5G and channel selected to AUTO.

You can see that it's well laid out and you can easily get where you need to be. If you look down at the very bottom of the screenshot you can see there's a link to \"Documentation\".

I purchased this one to replace an older model that I thought my cat broke by sitting on the wifi control button for a long time and caused the system to turn the control off for the button. But as it turns out all I had to do was wait for a power outage that knocked out our power for a couple of hours and the thing reset and now works like new. But Hey, we are using the new one anyway. The one difference that I found was this. With the old one i used my wifi for making cell phone calls and if I walked out on the back porch the signal would cut out, not anymore. This one does have better coverage, and honestly it was one third the price of the older model that I purchased about 7 years ago. So, I am very happy with this.

Should be a great product.\nI set the package up, plug and play super easy. Set up my networks. Added my devices. Tested and everything was working GREAT. Excellent coverage, excellent speeds, everything was as it should be.\nAfter a day, the internet signal went out. Ok, I reset the router. Still no internet signal... must be something wrong with ISP. Reset modem, problem solved.\nIt happened again. And again. Internet connectivity goes out completely, doesn't resolve until I reset the cable modem. This happens after a half hour sometimes, other times it'll work for 6 hours. It happens completely randomly: during heavy wifi traffic, during no traffic, while streaming, while gaming. In the early AM, during peak hours, in the middle of the night. No pattern I've been able to discern.\nThought that was weird because it was literally just working. I put the rental router back on, it works fine. THROUGHOUT THIS ENTIRE PROCESS THE OTHER ROUTER WORKS FINE.\nSo I put the Netgear back on, and tried to troubleshoot it myself.\nFirmware updated.\nFull factory reset and reconfigure.\nVarious manual settings changes (static IP, lower MTU size, etc), whatever I could find on the forums.\nNone of it works. The router STILL drops internet, still completely random.\nAt this point I contact Netgear support - who are SUPER NICE, I totally enjoyed working with support. They've been great, super clear, super helpful - well spoken. They've had great suggestions (most I'd already done, and did again), they had some new suggestions, all I've tried and STILL the router keeps losing that internet connectivity.\nSo at this point I'm at my wits end... 1 star product.\nI would've really hoped this could have been a simple plug and play set up, good to go out of the box. I get SOME configuration, but the amount of troubleshooting for this product seems unreasonable to me at this point. I've lost my return window, my own fault... but I really did think I would get it to work.\nBeware lemons!! If it has this internet dropping problem BEWARE!",

Second, setup is touted as being easy but I felt the whole process took longer than necessary and the multiple reboots annoying. Third, and most importantly, the signal strength/coverage area isn't as good as what I achieved with the R6300. I used to be able to pull into my driveway and in the few seconds it took to park and remove my phone from my back pocket, I would already be connected to the wifi. Now it takes several minutes for it to switch over. With the 3 exposed antennas, versus the internal antenna on the the R6300, I expected the opposite. All of that out of the way, it does its job. I have consistent 89+/- Mbps download speeds with occasional spikes to 215 Mbps via the data cable (my ISP says up to 60 Mbps with my package). The intermittent loss of signal are resolved. In all honesty, if I could find another Netgear R6300 or the equivalent I would choose it over this model but Netgear is no longer offering that style so this will have to do.",

They tried to help and after 4 hours the tech concluded that the router was not sending a wifi signal and agreed on replacing it but the company did not have one I stock and decided to give me an upgrade after I sended the old one back. The replacement arrived but it was the one I sent back to them. They mentioned that they would send out the rorrect one and they apologize for the delay. They wanted me to pay to have the same one I sent back already again a second time and because the mistake was thiers and it was not fair for me to have to send this old one back a second time. I did not get the replacement router from netgear. Customer service does not work they work it should. They will answer the phone but they will not honor thier customers at all. So they will try to get you to fill out a survey to give them a wonderful experience with andrhats when they will stab u in the back.",

                "review_body": "The other customer reviews prepared me for the different setup approaches.  I took the manual approach and it took a little more than 2 hours, but I am a computer programmer.  I was prepared with my \"junk email\" address for the Netgear account setup.  Also, if it says you need a firmware update be sure to do that because (it seemed to me) I couldn't get to the Internet without doing so. I also took others advice and made my SSID and security ID the same as my last router to minimize grief from all the many devices. Finally, when I unplugged the router in order to connect to my UPS it takes a bit for it to initialize (just like a cable modem would). Watch the indicator lights until they stabilize (or take a walk and come back later). But all these things I listed are just so things go smoothly for others, it's not like you replace a wireless router or have it lose power very often at all, right?\n\nThe reason I am pleased is what others have reported:  the range and speed seem great, having watched a lot of streaming TV this afternoon and evening. I also checked and have WiFi signal throughout our house and even out in the yard. The unit arrived quickly and the price was very reasonable. I followed the documentation link from the router admin page and downloaded a 163 page user's manual.",

So it worked well with that and hooked right up with no issues. Cameras have little to no lag, notifications come through quicker and they are connected to the 5GHz network like I originally wanted. I thought all 40 some of my devices had decent signal, but after I connected up this extender 11 devices connected to it. So I know it was well worth the $100 price tag.",

Made sure the router had the latest firmware, put the AX1800 within the 3m range, stood on my head, crossed fingers, etc.  Bought Asus extenders thinking it would make the mesh easier to setup.  First tried with the Asus Router App, that failed.  Then I tried to manually add it by logging in to the router to add the mesh node that way, that failed.  Each time I reset the AX1800 and rebooted the router.  I even tried them with a friend's Asus router, same issue. \"Unable to add your AiMesh node to your AiMesh system due to the following\" blah blah blah.\nFinally connected the AX1800 to the router using an Ethernet cable, I was able to add the AX1800 on the first attempt via the router's web interface.  +1 kudos to Asus for coming up with apps to make the process appear easy, but -2 kudos for the apps not working.  Doing some research I see a lot of people having the same issue.\nThey do work great once (if) you can get them setup.",

                "review_body": "My Spectrum router and modem were engaging in significant buffering and dropped signals so I looked around for a solution and lached onto the original router from Asus, which is the AX1800S.  It was ok but after reading about AImesh I had to try it  and then purchased another one of those and set it up downstairs.  There was a minimal learning curve. The firmware needs to be updated.  That took an Ethernet cable for the second router.  Then I had still had a dead spot in the garage so I purchased the 3rd device, the RX-AP56.  I think if I had purchased the AP56 first I wouldn't have needed the second router.  The model I received did not block both outlet holes as others have mentioned.  I never hooked it up to ethernet.  I just plugged it in and within a minute it was recognized by the system and updated firmware.  It then claimed it had failed although in fact it had succeded.  I then unplugged it and moved it to the garage where it works beautifully.  The Asus software determines where each device is assigned.  The 5ghz band speed test show about 190 mps. The 2.4 ghz shows about 40 mps.  All in all it was worth setting up this Aimesh and now everything works flawlessly.  No more buffering or dropped WiFi.  As far as tech support I didn't need any.  The devices and updates generally handled themselves. I spent $220 for these routers and add ons but for me it was worth it.  I think the ideal set up for most users would be the AX1800S router backed by the RX-AP56 (Also labeled AX1800 for some reason.)",

Using AI-Mesh tie in I was able to loop into existing network in under 10 minutes once powered up. I was using an ASUS Router for mesh system but kept running into gaming interference - I think the two routers either didn\u2019t talk together very well together and thus create conflicts, or something else - not sure. But the repeater sits on the other side of 2 walls, one interior and one exterior. The unit is on my back porch pushing wifi to a fifth wheel trailer where I work during the day. I haven\u2019t been able to really test the unit but I did some quick download/upload tests and found I was getting about 70% of my maximum speed potential will virtually no wireless interruption. Great to see. I wasn\u2019t going to keep it if I ran into the same problems I had been experiencing before but my gaming and telecommunications using this device is much more steady so I\u2019m happy to invest to make everything work better day to day. Sucks that the router couldn\u2019t work as strong as this - maybe as a standalone router it\u2019ll be just fine.",

Then hell started with calls to their overseas call center which were worthless both from understanding what the agent was say because of the thick accent and more importantly the lack of any troubleshooting skills.  So four calls later and now six form generated emails from ASUS claiming my phone is busy (which it isn't) and each time the emails say the exact same thing \"can you give us your phone number and time to call you\"?  Each time I do then I never hear back.  I provided a backup number so at least that was not going to be their excuse any longer.  So my recommendation is do no buy their products and not because they aren't any good, but rather because they have zero customer service.  Oh, and I tried the chatting service but I have been waiting for a live person to answer the chat for more than an hour after submitting the problem and being told I would be transferred to a real person.  I suspect most likely it will be sent back to the Philippines call center.",

We now have 5 bars of signal out on our porch where only a month ago we had a very intermittent one bar.\n\nGreat product that delivered great results.",

When I first set it up it seemed to connect with my ASUS base station ok, but I could never achieve anything near the advertised Wi-Fi speed . Max download was only ~200Mbps which was only about 20Mbps faster than my old mesh router. Even when I had it set up in the same room as the base station. It frequently needed optimization for the first month to re-enable the 5 GHz capability.  Even though I have a Gbit internet connection. Without optimization(which takes several minutes and is very disruptive) I would get less than 20MBps. On my TV, which would cause my streaming services to freeze while I was in the middle of my workout routine.  If this wasn\u2019t frustrating enough, a little more than a month after buying it ASUS had a firmware update which now makes it impossible for this product to connect to the base station for more than 5 min before disconnecting and flashing blue until I unplug it and reset it again. The only solution I have found requires either downgrading the firmware on the base station(which may or may not work) or connecting to the device via SSH to disable the feature causing the disconnection issue. I may be able to get it working again but only because I am somewhat computer savvy.  I certainly would not recommend anyone waste their money on this though. Even if you manage to keep it working, the performance isn\u2019t worth the money.",

The ethernet port is on the BOTTOM. Last I checked virtually ALL outlets worldwide were oriented VERTICALLY which means you can NOT use the other plug in the outlet if you want to plug something in to the ethernet port.\n\n2. The \"cool\" shwoopy design on the bottom blocks the 2nd outlet. I couldn't find anything that would plug into that outlet including \"slim\" style plugs. And none of the dozens of wall bricks I have would work either.\n\nI need to use the 2nd outlet to plug in another device and I need to connect that device to ethernet. I will very likely return this range extender and put out the extra $30 to $40 for another router with AiMesh just to overcome these extremely POOR design issues.\n\nOn the flip side, Tech Support was quick to answer a call. The setup was still basically fiddle with it until it connected. Initially, the node wouldn't properly connect. I finally tried a different power outlet and after a couple of more tries, it connected.\n\nI haven't thoroughly tested the WiFi signal, but I didn't get any faster download speed after installation. I'll keep testing.\n\nAnd, the devices that were NOT working properly because they are very far away from my router, have stayed connected for the last 3 days and functioned properly. Go figure. Take your car to a mechanic and it does NOT make that funny noise.\n\nI have some other IoT devices that I'll be connecting over the next few days. I may just start by unplugging the node and see how they work without it. The node would put a signal much closer to the devices, but I think I will try it without the node first.",

It was about the same speed as my 2ghz network which didn't need the extended range. I wanted to extend my 5ghz signal. No matter what settings I tried I was unable to get speeds approaching the 5ghz signal when physically close to the main router.\n\nThen I realized I had an ASUS router with AiMesh support so I added it as a node with the Asus Router app (as opposed to the Asus Extender app) and it automatically set itself up. Now I get about 70% of my 5ghz speed when sitting out at my patio table with zero added latency. It's great. I can even stream VR games to my Quest outside using Virtual Desktop using the node.

It only pretends to improve things while actually creating new issues.\n\nSince MESH mimics your router, the signal is pushed/enhanced instead of simply repeated so that you don't lose signal strength like you do with older extenders.\n\nHowever, these are not easy to set up. It can often take multiple tries (7th try's a charm) and they don't always move well if you need to relocate one. Additionally, if you are dependents on wifi calling because of poor cell reception, you WILL have trouble with this (and, it seems any MESH system). As the phone is passed from one node to the next the signal will drop with no warning. You're still connected, but one of you won't hear anything. You'll have to hang up, open your phone's settings, turn off wifi and turn it back on and, hopefully, connect on your call again. Sometimes, when a call comes in, you'll answer it and hear only silence. Same steps too, then call the person back. Other times, you'll have to restart your phone to reestablish a good connection with your system in order to make a call.\n\nDoesn't that sound fun? MESH is better, they said. Just like 5G will improve cell service, right? Yeah...no.",

The units both joined as expected with a 5g backhaul, reported to the AiMesh that they were well connected and otherwise happy \u2013 but never worked.  Any configuration change caused the units to resync/configure (rapid flashing blue light) for minutes at a time, report OK/Ready (white light),  but not actually accept any configuration changes (reselecting the node in the AiMesh management area showed the settings returned to defaults).  No client would connect to the node, even if bound to the node.  If the node lost power, it would take close to 5 minutes for it to report OK, but still wouldn\u2019t work.  I returned one to see if I had a bad unit, and the replacement acted the same (so 3 out of 3 didn\u2019t work).  I have to conclude these simply don\u2019t work as AiMesh nodes.\n\nAs a workaround to fill the zone gap, I factory reset them and then added them as repeaters.  Very straightforward and simple to get them setup and they function as expected in this configuration.  I\u2019ve only two small issues with them as repeaters.  First, management must be done on the unit themselves, and they can be difficult to find on your network, and if you do, finicky to access the management page.  Asus clearly knows this as they recommend you use their Wireless Router Device Discovery Utility, which isn\u2019t available from the device\u2019s support page, but was from the ZenWiFi\u2019s page.  You do need to be connected to the SSID created by the repeater to manage it, but that isn\u2019t really a big deal. Second, the management page hides any \u201cadvanced\u201d configuration you might need for the new network, such as hiding the SSID of the new networks or tweaking performance.  You can access the page, but you must manually go to it (/Advanced_Wireless_Content.asp).\n\nSo \u2013 fine as repeaters, skip if you\u2019re looking for an AiMesh node.",

                "review_body": "Like many, I had some dead spots in my wifi coverage near the extremes of my house. It's not a big house, but without a bunch of work, I can't optimally place my modem and router. I have been running an Asus RT-AC3100 with no real complaints. I had a second RT-AC3100 as an AiMesh node and it worked well enough for a few months, but then anything connected to that node would start to lose internet. I could reboot the node and get it back, but this would happen again in as little as 24 hours, requiring another reboot. This continued even after I hardwired the node to the main router with CAT6 cable. I decided before I upgrade everything, I'd see if a repeater would fill the need. Not an ideal solution, but I'm tired of trying to fiddle with settings and the off the shelf mesh packages are expensive (at least the good ones are) and come with their own problems.\n\nI picked this up on recommendation from DongKnowsTech. He seems to know his stuff and, despite not usually recommending repeaters, he said he had no reservations about recommending or using this particular device. About a month in and things seem to be working just fine. It took a bit to get it setup as a mesh node, but I've had that issue before with other AiMesh devices (it can be *very* finicky detecting new nodes being added, even if wired directly). My dead spot is gone and my guest network is also extended, which I don't think is always the case for nodes. Part of me wonders if I should have just put the money for this into a newer router with a stronger signal, or just have gotten a full blown AiMesh compatible router and made that a node instead, but whatever. This works and I'm happy so as long as it keeps working.\n\nAiMesh has come a long way since I first tried it when it became available, but it's definitely a bit of a pain to setup. But Asus firmware is incredibly flexible and full of features once it is. You don't need a cloud account to control your own router locally, which is how it should be. Their support isn't always great, but that's not unique to Asus (i.e, they're about as good/bad as anyone else in this space). Overall, I'd say this is a reasonable solution for dead spots and it gives you WiFi 6 compatibility and options for how to set it up. For <$100, it's worth a try if you need to extend your wifi. Hopefully it lasts.",

                "review_body": "I upgraded my Xfinity internet plan last year (2021) to increase my internet plan speed from 150 mbps to 600 mbps. But with my old Xfinity voice-modem (Arris Touchstone TM 722G/CT voice-modem which was no longer supported by Xfinity) and my old, yet very reliable, Ubiquiti AirRouter HP router (rated at 150 mbps), I was barely getting 100 mbps download.\n\nAfter talking to several individuals who are quite savvy about modems and routers, I decided to go with the eero 6 Dual Band Mesh Wi-Fi 6 System to replace my Ubiquiti router.  The eero WiFi 6 set-up was fairly easy (I did have to call their tech support several times, and they were very patient and helpful), and after all was up and running my download speed only increased to about 150 mbps which was still far below what I was paying for.  The main eero WiFi 6 router is in my computer room and the other three eero units/devices are located in our living room, the master bedroom and my wife\u2019s sewing room\u2014excellent coverage at all locations.  The choke point for increasing my internet download speed was the old Xfinity modem.\n\nI contacted Xfinity to arrange an appointment to have a new up-to-date gateway modem installed to replace their outdated and unsupported voice-modem.  The new Xfinity gateway is a combo modem/router with voice for telephone\u2014an Xfinity Modem CGM4140COM.  Since I now had the eero WiFi 6, I asked the Xfinity installation tech to turn off the router in the new Xfinity gateway modem so I could use the eero devices only.  He said by doing that it would put the Xfinity gateway modem in the Bridge Mode (enabled) for the eero 6 Wifi routers, and I would lose a lot of the security features that come with the new Xfinity gateway modem/router.  He said I could still use the eero Wifi 6 routers by connecting an Ethernet cable from the Xfinity modem to my base station eero WiFi 6 router.  By doing that connection (and leaving the Bridge Mode disabled) I would have to have two separate networks with separate usernames and passwords which I didn\u2019t see as a problem.  So the Xfinity tech helped set-up those two networks, and all works very well\u2014I\u2019m glad I took his advice.\n\nThe internet/wifi set-up has the co-ax cable coming into my new Xfinity gateway modem.  Then an Ethernet cable goes from the Xfinity modem to my eero WiFi 6 router.  Since the eero WiFi 6 router has two Ethernet ports, another Ethernet cable goes from my eero router into my desktop computer.  Now my internet download speeds typically run between 600-700 mbps regardless which network is selected.\n\nThis eero WiFi 6 set-up has worked very well for me, and it\u2019s also very compatible with Xfinity.  Both eero and Xfinity have excellent apps for the iPhone.",

We had great coverage, the app worked well enough,though I wish it had a web interface like my older routers... then today I tried to unpause my son's laptop (we pause the kids devices overnight) and no devices were showing up.  Doing anything just said something went wrong and try again later.  I rebooted my phone - which is the only way to get into the interface - and no good.  Tried to uninstall and reinstall app, and now when I log in it just says \"Well, that was unexpected\" and suggested I try again later.\n\nI was very leery of a network router that depended on a third party company for administration, most of my old devices had a built in web interface I used.  Well 30 days in I can't take it back, and now I'm basically locked out of my network.  Tried calling support, and over 75 minute wait time :(  My kids can't do their homework with this, so I'm about to hook up my old router and just use it.  Not deal for a $250 router that's just a month old.  I emailed support, so we'll see what they come back with.",

I placed the router, and two mesh point plug-ins strategically in my home and now I am getting strong service everywhere. All of our devices work. THe mobile app lets you speed test all over the house. On that note, I love the App. I set the entire system up in under 4 minutes. You get to name your own network and set the passwords.

                "review_body": "I have had this system installed and running for 3 years. It\u2019s up-to-date with all software updates and until recently, worked well. Then I pushed it over the edge.\n\nI have had a Frontier/Ziply fiber service for 6 years with my down/up speed starting at 35/35 6 years ago and gradually increasing through 100/100, 200/200 and now 1G/1G. I installed this system in my 3500sqft, 3 story house in 2017 at 100/100 with no router from Frontier. I had 2 mesh points out the box. It worked great with 4 Apple TV\u2019s, 2 XBox\u2019s and several cell phones and laptops all wireless. Coverage was fine and I could even sit out on my back patio with my laptop and stream stuff.\n\nI then added a few Ring cameras and that created a coverage problem because most of the Ring cameras only support 2.4 GHz. So I added 4 additional mesh points and upgraded the line to 200/200. It worked OK, even though some of the Ring cameras would have connectivity problems if too many of them were recording at the same time.\n\nThen COVID hit and I had to work from home. That pushed my utilization up significantly as everything  is now video calls and all VPN. Although most devices are connected through mesh points, all traffic flows through one box and it was also functioning as the router to the network. So I switched to bridge mode and put the Frontier router back in place. That alleviated some pressure, but I was still struggling to get more than 100/100 even though the line was rated at 200/200.\n\nI called Ziply to upgrade to 1G/1G and get that from their router if I enable that WiFi, but leaving the AmpliFi in place, I\u2019m getting no more than 180/180 with all devices connected and I now have 40 devices connected to this mesh network.\n\nThe crux of the issue: This device works great for a small device count, but as more and more of your home is automated and you are streaming more and more, it tips over.\n\nAnother annoyance is that now I am permanently working from home, I need better control of the router and it doesn\u2019t allow me the control I need. I end up needing the Frontier router to work around that.\n\nSo I have now replaced this system with the NETGEAR Orbi 6 AX6000 (RBK853). It comes in around the same price as this system does with the 4 additional mesh points I added and it is a much more powerful system.\n\nThis is a good starter. It\u2019s not an end state.",

                "review_body": "Purchased the first version of the router (mesh point on magnetic ball) a year ago, and my love for it keeps growing.  I have bought a new router almost every year for about two decades.  For the first time, I bought the same router two times in a row (different use case).\n\nI'll skip the general spec discussion since others have done an excellent job.  I cover what stands out for me:\n\n1.  Frequent updates that introduce many new features and security patches.  Installing them is as easy as touching the screen when a notification alert appears.  While the phone app is great, some of the new features only appear in the browser version, so I strongly suggest you check it after an update.  The \"Ad blocker\" option is fantastic; no more adds when scrolling through my phone news feed.  I retired my Pi-hole (DNS sink) -- this seems to be just as good.  The visual topology is another stand-out. Of course, the continuing additions of 802.11 features are a plus.\n\n2. Coverage:  while I am sure others have raised this, I wanted to call out how great it is with 30K ft coverage; there is not a blind spot on my property.\n\n3. Design:  best design ever!  The cube is cute, and nothing is more straightforward than plugging in a mesh point - no power cords or finding shelf space for it; great for those long hallways.  This is a unique approach that I hope is rewarded with sales, so the design carries forward.  If the current fad of using the same unit as both router and mesh points continues, I might not be upgrading for a long time.",

                "review_body": "First, let me say I had WiFi 6 and found that it just wasn\u2019t working for the whole house, so I decided to go back to an AC mesh setup and after a ton of research, I still wasn\u2019t sure if I wanted this or not (All I knew was google putting Mics and smart speakers in their mesh meant that was not an option for me at all).\n\nSo. I take the thing out of the box, I download the Amplifi App onto my iPhone, and immediately the app finds the Amplifi HD router...  Within 2 to 3 minutes, I\u2019ve setup WiFi, added an Administrator password, and had the 2 satellites up and running.\n\nInside of 10 minutes, I created a group called kids, added their devices to that group and set a schedule for when their internet would turn on and shut off.  After that I was able to add a second SSID (you can have multiple) that was only accessible by devices on the 5GHz band.\n\nWhat I find cool is that this thing uses the same setup as the gamers edition of the router!  Now something I didn\u2019t realize about that, was that I can optimize each device for one of three settings (gaming, multimedia, general computing).\n\nGaming is lower speed, but also lower latency (Great for gaming consoles or gaming PCs).\n\nMultimedia is higher speed, lower jitter, and slightly higher latency (This is awesome for TV\u2019s or connected exercise equipment).\n\nGeneral computing is pretty much no optimization for gaming or multimedia, it\u2019s just a pipe for the internet.\n\nTo me, the grouping, scheduling, and optimization features of this device are awesome and really make for a surprising level of control.  The simplicity of the device is also something that most people would likely appreciate, and the coverage just works!\n\nAnother way you can limit the access for devices around the house is by creating secondary SSIDs that only run on one of the satellites, this can effectively allow you to cap  some users to 2.4 GHz speeds.\n\nI know many people are wondering if they should go with an AX system, but honestly, this thing can push near 500 Mbps for WiFi and near 950 Mbps for hardwired connections, so you\u2019re not likely to need more than what this thing can do with current connection speed options.\n\nThe only thing I kind of dislike about it, is that accessing the router admin settings through a web browser isn\u2019t a complete set of settings and it really shouldn\u2019t be this limited.\n\nOh and another thing, this router does not use the default 192.168.0.1, 192.168.1.1, or 10.10.0.0 private IP Subnets for accessing the administrator console, so it might make it a little bit harder for less skilled people to break into.\n\nHowever, if you\u2019re looking for an excellent, easy to use,  stable mesh WiFi system, this is the one to choose!",

I also could not get signal in my garage or anywhere outdoors. This limited me greatly on using things like wifi security cameras etc. I finally decided to give this system a try, and am really glad I did. Very easy to set up and works GREAT! I no longer have an dead spots in the house and get coverage far out into my yard.",

I pulled the devices out and charged up the remote units and then followed the quick start guide to get the main unit up and connected to our cable modem with a cat 5 cable.  The remote units synced-up after a couple of attempts and I placed those at their permanent homes.  Next, we started connecting devices and this went very smoothly for all 15 or so devices for the family. Its worked flawlessly for about 3 weeks now.\nThere are no drop spots in the house and I can pull our Sonos Move speakers all the way out to the back yard (70-80 feet from the house) and have no issues.  One thing to note is that many mesh routers have issues with Sonos systems and this router was recommended by the AV expert who sold me the Sonos equipment.  So far so good!  Speed is really fast and even with two kids on gaming computers, we don't see any delays or glitching.  Really happy with this!",

Mom has one of the antennae/boosters on her near wall, and I've set the base/router on the back room wall closest to her.  We have excellent signal throughout both homes and even far into the back yard!  And it cranks out appropriate speeds to our allotted bandwidth (I sure hope I'm using these terms correctly.) Mom can stream her shows on the tv and play her phones games in her house and I can be streaming in mine while hubby plays online games with no issues whatsoever.\n\nIt has paid for itself already in the few months of NOT having an extra $80 cable company Internet bill.",

For instance I would prefer to configure my DNS with OpenDNS as opposed to the default broadband DNS system. The UI does not permit you to change the DNS settings for the DHCP scope.\nIf you have ever used a nest product and were satisfied with it, then you get the same feel of quality and simplicity from this product.\nI have not had to interact with tech support so I can accurately judge / rate that so it got a 5 star by default.\nThe packaging:\nExtremely well packaged. Much like, apple, nest, beats packaging, very nice first impression\nThe hardware:\nWell built and sturdy. The base is a bit smaller than a small tissue box. The mesh antennas are almost twice the size of a standard wall outlet. The antennas are connected to the 3 prong power adapter by high powered magnet. The antennas do pivot if required, which is neat.\nThe application was easy to download and interact with. Initially it connects a default ssid automatically.\nThe wizard walks you through configuring the system. Very simple to follow steps and if you do them right it will connect to the internet and suggest a firmware update, most likely. If you have the mesh antennas, make sure they are plugged in and connected to the base before updating firmware.\nI have AT&T Fiber. I just disabled my wifi on the ATT router. Plugged the Amplifi base internet port into the router switch port. After going through the wizard it was internet connected and all wireless devices were connected. I used the same SSID and WPA2 Preshared key that was configured on the ATT router. This way I didn't have to reconfigure all 20 plus devices in my home. It was that simple to install. Make sure you use the Ethernet cable that comes with Amplifi. I was using a bad cable and was getting poor performance.\nI have not had any performance problems at all with the device since it has been installed.\nThis does support IPv6, Port Forwarding, Band Steering, NAT UPNP, Bridge Mode. I was only disappointed I could not adjust the DNS settings in DHCP settings",

When I first received and set up the router I was impressed, it was massive improvement over my old Belkin G router.  However just over a month after I purchased the product, my wife and I started getting connectivity issues, the router would randomly drop all connections simultaneously.  I noticed this while on my home pc, my tablet was next to me and both of these had lost connection at the same time.  Most of the time the disconnection would be brief, other times it would remain disconnected until the router was unplugged and plugged back in.  I liked the management tools in the router figured I would give customer support a chance to help me resolve this issue.  After I was on hold for roughly 20 minutes I was able to speak with a customer support person with a very heavy Indian accent which made the the call difficult to begin with.  I was told that since the router did not have a serial number stamped on the back she could not help with the issue, I asked if she could help with a model number.  She told me no, she needed the serial number and the phone call was disconnected.  I called back in and after another 20-30 minutes was able to talk to another customer service rep, which managed to find the order, but since I was 4 days past their 30 day warranty period, I would have to pay for premium support.  I would certainly not recommend this product or netgear products in general going forward.  I will likely try my luck with another brand next and see how it turns out, currently looking at this product, also available on amazon:\n\n[...]",

When I got it I immediately started to panic that I had gotten the wrong item because the package was so small. But I looked at all the details and it was exactly the same thing except they now made it in a smaller, thinner, sleeker version. It's almost half the size of the original one I had. Which is extremely nice because it's easily tucked away. This NETGEAR N600 Dual Band Wi-Fi Router works great as my other one was starting to go causing internet connectivity issues but now no more of that problem. I would by this product again.",

I purchased this because we had more devices on the Belkin router than it could handle and it was suggested to me that I needed an upgrade. Researched and purchased this one. Arrived on time, in secure packaging, and was fairly easy to get working (had to search online for instructions and spend about a hr getting it all worked out). In hindsight I likely made the process more difficult than it was. Has been nothing but great since then. Signal is strong on both channels. Have had no issues with it being a refurbished unit. I highly recommend if you're in the market for a router....",

Use this unit as main router and network hub, have two other routers used as access points. HINT: If you are considering this unit to replace an older b/g/n router, buy this router and use your old one as an access point for your legacy devices (i.e. my PSP 3000 only has 802.11b compatibility) which means you cannot use WPA2-TKIP on some older devices. So I have this new Netgear router blasting on two \"n\" bands, an old Belkin next to it pimping out the \"b\" (anything with only a 802.11g is on here, they don't need the speed, i.e. Wii) And then an older Netgear router in my office using the ethernet cable across the house to use a b/g/n for the network printer and wired stuff.",

I phoned a friend back using the iPod and a VoIP app. She said the sound was much clearer then the cell I was using. Kudos to Amazon, too: I ordered Saturday night and the goods were delivered to my door four days later for a song. I got the Netgear wifi router and a Tenvis IP camera for just a little more than what the wifi was going to cost at a big box store. Happy camping!",

Also taking into account I run electronics Hard, my routers probably harder. When running it never left me expecting more out of it, and provided good dual band coverage and speed, if your house is bigger than a 3 bedroom apartment however, coverage will leave you wanting more. and I would recommend something with more powerful radios, or at leaat newer ones for, anything bigger.\n\nIt has all the bridging, and advanced config i have come to expect from netgear as well, includes the genie foe those lazy folks that want plug and play ;)\n\nThese will probably all eventually fry, but they do more with less.  as an interim device it is solid, but dont expect too many devices these days to last forever.",

Otherwise I'm very happy with it.\n\nUpdate, 9/6/2012: I've had it for a couple weeks and I've only had to power cycle it once.  It runs pretty hot but overall still works well.  I just hope I don't have to keep power cycle this thing too often.",

The signal is great, quality is good, speed is good, even when storms bring down electricity it doesn't take long to boot back up. For the price I'd definitely recommend. I even purchased a second for my parents house and they have had no complaints either. It gives you a preset password and information to register the machine and your Netgear account. It is a simple set up, this was my first time setting one up and I had no issues. Regarding signal ours reaches upstairs and out into our yard quite a ways. We also have multiple machines on it the majority of the time including TV, tablets, phones and laptops. It never slows the signal down. Overall great product.",

Realizing now that I only paid $35.00 for it through AMAZON, I will replace it with my ancient WNR2000v3 that still works and I can access.\n\nDO NOT BUY FROM NETGEAR - THEY DO NOT SUPPORT THEIR PRODUCTS!  If they did, they techs actions would have been corrected on May 26, 2017.\n\nN600 worked well for a season.  I started getting emails indicating that my free tech support would soon end.  I didn't respond due to lack of problems...if something isn't broke, don't fix it!\n\nAbout a month later, I was unable to login to retrieve medical files.  Costco also stopped connecting.  For some reason, it is working today with Amazon.  I called the support number on the box.  After brief troubleshooting, the CSR said she discovered the problem and could fix it for more than I originally paid for the unit.  Obviously, the CSR had accessed my router.  What transpired earlier to disable most secure connections?  I have no ability to access router preferences until I buy a new computer.\n\nI can't access earlier versions of NetGenie for early Mac Mini models.  I'm maxed out at 10.6.8.  Are there archived installers of NetGenie available?  Please link...\n\nBTW...I read several problem reviews that were resolved once the consumer logged into the router.  Was my unit set back to a default or adverse setting months after I set my system up???  Still no followup from NetGear.",

The WNDR3400 specs made it seem the level of router I needed for my home use. It was very easy to connect to the new modem and was recognized by my PC, laptop, tablet, and blueray player/TV connection. Streaming has improved on all my devices.

People complain about the signal range but they probably don't realize that 5 GHz spectrum has less range than the standard 2.4 GHz band.  2.4 band signal is EXCELLENT and will deliver the 802.11n speeds that you bought it for.  5GHz band is for streaming video and online gaming - most devices (laptops, ipads etc.) operate on the 2.4 channel, so you can separate the 2 bands to reduce wireless interference (as long as you have the download speed from your ISP to support it).  Separate SSIDs assignable to the 2 bands, plus another SSID assignable to a guest network that won't be able to access devices on the secured LAN.  Pretty good router for $33...plus it's sexy too!",

                "review_body": "Netgear does not include a software disc or any instructions on how to configure this factory refurb item.  Others have posted instructions on Amazon (which did not work for me/my laptop), but I feel the manufacturer should include a simple one page install cheat sheet. I understand not wanting to waste a disc on cheapskates who buy refurb products, but Netgear seriously can't spare a measly little piece of paper?\n\nTo top it off, Netgear does not extend any phone support to refurb items - they tell you to go online for email help.  However, the email help system requires the item's serial number, but their refurbished items do not have one.  That's right, the space on the router where it would be is blank.  In addition, the Netgear website requires the serial number and version number (V1, V2, or V3, which the router/paperwork/box do not indicate) for any/all downloads.  So, they force you to the web for help/support and then ask you for the serial/version numbers to get any help online, which of course you will not have.  In other words, they don't want to help you unless you paid full price for a new item.\n\nSince I could not get this to work and needed Wifi right away, I returned the item to Amazon and purchased a Linksys N300 router at Walmart for the same price.  It came with great resources and I had it working in 10 minutes. Turns out I didn't even need the dual-band power for the size of my house so it was okay.\n\nAgain, this is probably a great deal for someone with more technical know-how, but novices may be better off paying more for a brand-new item.",

With that said, we never experience losing connection.  With the two previous Belkin routers I had, this was an issue and also it was a nightmare to try and sync with the printers or with the other computers.  With this Netgear N600, you can count on being able to print over the network everytime (and connect to other computers every time).  I didn't even think that was  possible until I installed this Netgear router.  I also have an external hard drive connected by cable to the the router and it works well too for when you want to do a backup on any computer.  I do ours about once a month or so at night time with a simple click of a button.  I'm into simplicity and don't want to spend a lot of time with home networking.

Very nice feature.\n\nThe USB Port was a surprise benefit. I've used it to set up a 1.5 TB network drive that is very handy to have for backups. Just a note for Mac users, it will not recognized a Mac formatted drive, so you can't use the network drive for Time Machine backups. I FAT formatted my drive and use Carbon Copy Cloner, and it works great. You can also easily use your network drive for videos, music, or whatever, since the Mac has no trouble with basic reading and writing to a network drive and it is plenty fast enough over the WiFi to stream media.",

I did not use the wizard, and found the web-setup very intuitive and easy to understand. It also works well with a legacy (read ancient) 802.11b device connected to my home weather station.\n\nA couple of things you should be aware of when purchasing a refurbished router: There is no manual or installation CD included. You only get the router, power supply and a 1m cat5 cable. Also, if Google location services has \"seen\" the router's mac address at a previous location (Clarksville, TN in my case) any wireless devices (Android phones are my issue right now) that use Google location services will report the incorrect location. I have submitted a request to Google to re-map the location of my router.\n\nI'm very pleased with this router and would recommend it to anyone.",

The range is good, it covered a large home with a full strength signal everywhere and the WAP was at one end of the residence.\nI bought a NETGEAR RangeMax 150 Wireless Router recently and the configuration was not straight forward, in fact I had to call Netgear Customer Support to get it working  Customer Support was good.\nI will continue to use Netgear products.

The constant attention it receives from computers, phones, tv's, tablets and game consoles is not enough for it. We have humbled it by placing it in the custody of less extravagant devices and under guard of plain clothes books.

The problem with all the others is that one computer or another on the network was always losing connection, necessitating a trip to the attic to reset the router.  Since only one computer at a time would experience the signal loss, I figured it must have something to do with how the router was assigning IP addresses to the various devices; that is, a DHCP conflict of some kind.  (Hey, I don't know, but it sounds good, eh?)  Anyhow, after replacing the previous router(s) with this one, the connection problems disappeared.  My only complaint is that support could be better for this product.  I've never spent money for factory support, but have posted to the Netgear Forum, both with questions about setup and use, and with comments to others who have problems.  The forum appears to be moderated by one knowledgeable user, but never someone from Netgear.  Thankfully the router doesn't require any substantial support.",

CLEAR Wireless was discontinued by Sprint, the wireless modem worked perfectly but is no longer useful without CLEAR. I then purchased a Netgear N450 from a big-box retailer. The modem would not connect, nor was I ever able to get to the elusive http://routerlogin.net (apparently thousands of others either - Google it). I therefore returned the router and purchased a Belkin, which worked fine. My roommate then decided a Wireless router would be better so I purchased the Netgear N600 Wireless, only to discover that whether configured via Ethernet, or using the wireless function, the same dreadful problems that occurred with the N450 returned with reckless abandon. I then attempted to use my wireless PHONE to navigate to the \"routerlogin\" site  just to see if there were instructions to assist - and even the phone could not navigate to the site! Continuous error message that is fully attributed to the domain.\n\nAfter being irreversibly irritated with this tin-foil excuse for technology, I used my phone to locate a Netgear help number. Fortunately, I found one. Unfortunately, I could understand NOTHING that the so-called tech support guy was saying. His accent was thick and his command of the English language was just as disastrous as the functionality of the product they shipped.  I refuse to guess to which overseas outpost the call was routed.\n\nNeedless to say, I detached the useless gadget, and returned to the wired Belkin version. I have also processed a return to Amazon, which is a rarity for me. I still desire a Wireless modem so I will search Amazon for a Belkin wireless. Netgear was once a trusted product. It's unfathomable that a tech company is aware of a common fault and have yet to address it - even the useless web address that is given cannot be accessed.\n\nIf the rating requirement was not done in whole stars, they would receive a third of one star from my experience, and that is generous. A total waste and a major irritant.",

The old one I had to run CAT5 to a center portion of the house (4 bedroom) or the signal was too weak at one end. Cable comes in at one end of house.

However, support walked me through several things to try and it is now working as expected.  Throughput and stability are excellent and the signal strength is fine for the application and adequately covers the house from a central position.\nMy only caution would be if you do have to update the firmware, make sure you explicitly do a reset of the factory settings before you proceed with configuration once the new firmware is in place.

I actually used the Netgear Genie app for my iphone to set it up and it was extremely easy. Since I've had this router I think I've had to reboot it exactly once. It works well with strong performance and good range (The higher channel numbers have better range ... I'm on 161). I'd recommend it to my neighbors, but I want the keep the 5 Ghz band to myself!",

I returned a Cisco Valet Plus (the white one) because it simply would not stream well.  I purchased to replace a still-working Cisco WRT54G, Ver. 6, and the Valet Plus was a downgrade as far as I could tell.  The WNDR3400 is great, streams well, and has not frozen or disconnected once.  The only cheap spec is the 10/100 (no gigaport) ethernet.  I have it sitting horizontal.  Also purchased a Cisco WET610N 2.4/5 bridge to wirelessly connect a DirecTV receiver.  That is working well, too.  Throughput appears to be about 15mb/sec from the first floor to the second floor via the bridge set on 5Ghz.  I have not tried the available USB port on the router.

I have had several NAT issues with routers running multiple xboxs, ps3s and a ps4. This router will work for 2 ps3s or two xboxs simultaneously for online play. I have around 20-25 wireless devices connected most of the time and have only needed to restart this router one time in the 2 months I have owned it. I understand that some reviewers have been hit or miss with receipt of a doa product.  I think that is one of the risks with a refurbished item and at this price you can't miss. It has all the speed 80% of users need. If it doesn't transfer files fast enough for you then you won't be finding a router at this price point. The router is centrally located in a ranch style 2400 sq ft home and has no reception problems. I would recommend for any non power user.",

There was no indication that I would be getting what apparently is a surplus item from Cablevision, even though it is advertised as new.  I had purchased the original router from Amazon for $69.95 with free shipping.  The one from Get More, PAY LESS!!!! was the same price but I had to pay shipping.  But it was still cheaper than all the other sources listed, so I ordered it.  It showed up at my house in a Priority Mail box with a note saying the box had arrived at the Post Office empty (it wasn't sealed).  The router must have fallen out at the Post Office along with the packing list, so they were able to put it back in the box and tape it up before delivering it.  When I opened the box with the router, there were no installation instructions of any kind, and no sticker with the Network Name and Network Key.  All that was there was a bunch of stickers with a Cablevision part number and MAC address.  It's obviously an old model (the damaged one was a WNDR3400v2 and had a more convenient arrangement of ports on the back than the one from Get More, PAY LESS!!!!), and I think this should have been explicitly spelled out in the description on Amazon.  I would send it back, but now the price of the router has gone way up.  So I guess I'm stuck with a replacement that's older than the original one I had.  Amazon should require its sellers to CLEARLY explain what they're going to send.\n\nUpdate:  After about 2 hours, communication with the router was lost.  It was quite hot when I turned it off.  I've contacted Amazon to return it.",

I will admit I'm a sucker for saving money by buying refurbished so I have owed quite a few factory refurbished items throughout the years and I've found that they aren't any more likely to break than a brand new item.  I've had this router for a couple of months now and it hasn't shown any signs of defects or problems.\n\nThe setup was a breeze except for the part where we (my boyfriend) forgot to write down the password and had to reset it pretty much immediately.  I have good Wi-Fi reception in the whole house, a requirement for me since I've recently started the process of automating the light switches, plugs, and thermostat.  These items all need a good signal to work properly.\n\nI also bought a Chromecast recently (highly recommend) and found the dual-bands works really well to send information from my chrome browser to the tv.\n\nI would highly recommend this router to anyone looking to set up a home network that can support multiple streaming devices.",

So, by using this one, I have had better performance that has been more than a better value in less than 8 months.  It is super-fast, allowing me to stream HD movies with any hiccups and upload music to my cloud drive very quickly.  However, I deducted 1 star because:\n1) the installation was a bit of a pain that took about 90 minutes due to many failed connections, and\n2) the connection on my laptop is lost after I wake it up from sleep/power save mode.  This issue happens maybe once every two weeks.  It's not a huge problem, it may very well be my PC (as my smartphone and tablet don't have this \"drop-out\" problem), but it's still frustrating nonetheless, a problem that shouldn't occur for a router at a price higher than $50 (in my opinion).

It is very fast, and I love the guest network.  My primary network is hidden and has a ridiculous password that would impossible to crack.  For friends that come over, I give them the guest network access which isolates them off of my network so they can't see any of my other devices or my hard drive.\n\nThe USB hard drive feature works great, I use it for pretty light duty stuff and it keeps up.  Would have been nice if I could also plug in my USB printer, but that doesn't seem to work.\n\nGreat router so far a couple of months in.  Hopefully it will keep up the good work.",

You can get an advanced router this way for the price of a simple new router.

Simultaneous means you can use both bands at the same time. Some dual band routers only let you use one at once. Simultaneous is nice because my computer may use 5ghz but my phone can only use 2.4ghz. Next, the usb port is an amazing feature. Hook up a flash drive or a HDD to it filled with music and videos, then any computer can access it on the network. Very easy to set up with both WIndows and Mac.\n\nOnly shortcomings of this router is that the USB port only does storage, you can't connect a printer to it and have it become a network printer (at least that is what the website says). Also, there is no gigabit. But for the price and the features you get for that price, it is a definite buy if you need one.",

                "review_body": "After dealing with our Linksys router for a decade or more we decided to step it up and get something more reliable and that would offer better wireless connectivity. This router is excellent and has everything you'll ever need. We currently have it set up on a very busy home network connected to a Surfboard modem and it works like a dream. We have an external drive attached to the network for storing movies and music and can stream them from any device in any room of the house (even outside). I currently run up to 10 devices a day on this baby so having dual channels and having the ability to create a second guest network is ideal! With 1 full blown media PC streaming to the theater tTV, 2 laptops, 2 netbooks, 3 smart phones, a Smart TV, a Roku box, and 2 other PCs connected to the network at all times, we haven't had issue one. The push-to-connect feature is great if you need to quickly connect to the router wirelessly.\n\nGreat price too! Searched around and found that Amazon had, by far, the best price. This router will handle anything you're doing now and more. Drop your old D-Link or Linksys and get something that will wake up your network.",

I have owned 3 different netgear routers, and will continue with there products.\n\nThe only things that I wasn't impressed with was its range and speed.  We use netflix a lot and I don't see much improvement over our previous MIMO g router, the signal actually seems to not broadcast as far, I wish u had the ability to change signal strengths like the ndr3700.  I also run a samsung bd6500, ps3, 2 laptops, 2 cell phones and a wii, but my laptop is the only one to pick up the 5ghz signal which seems like a waste, could be the distance of the equiptment.  I also bought a 1.5tb wd essential, but can only map the new drive to one laptop, I will look into this more as it probably is an issue on my end.  I would not see the need for a gb router, so for the money this is a great router and I would reccommend.",

When my Mom finally decided to try and turn off and disable open DNS and Netgear Genie, everything started working just fine.

Since we have had a Netgear router for 8 years with no problems, we decided to get another Netgear product. When I first set up the product I was not impressed. I selected the 5.0 band for the devices. My Netflix would stop streaming and the internet kept dropping on my computer. Upset, I researched to see if other people were having problems and if I should return the router. I learned that most products need to be on a 2.5 band and can't handle 5.0. Since switching to a lower band, my mother and I have had no problems. Internet is fast and streaming Netflix was not problem. In addition, her wireless printer responds faster than ever. The software that comes with the router is fantastic. It is easy to determine the strength of the signal overall and allows you to test the strength and range of the single in every room of the house. It is also easy to trouble shoot and determine if you are having with your internet provider or with your router. I am happy that Netgear remains a reliable band!",

The second one I ordered was \"like new\" which was fulfilled by amazon.  This one is almost perfect.It work perfectly except for ethernet port 1.  According to Time warner cable, its a bad port as my computer could not make an ethernet connect with it.  I'm not going to bother sending it back since there are 4 ports on it and the other three work great.  I don't normally use ethernet, but I am using it for my gbox which it gives 100mps.

Dual-bands work simultaneously and both offer good range and speed.  Wireless connections to the router stay solid throughout my house and the speed stays consistent, which is better than the Linksys performed.  Has standard security features that work well, although I had to change my access key since this router does not allow special characters (#, !, etc.) to be part of the key.  This meant that I had to change the key on all my laptops and printers.  A small pain, but an easy fix.  Admin GUI is plain but easy to navigate.  Has a setting to check for firmware updates each time you log in and the installation of any update is handled by the router.  The router is designed to be a desktop unit and has no mounting holes, so I had to rig a bracket to mount it where I wanted it.  USB port works well, but connecting to the USB device is not intuitive.  I do not use a USB device often, so I have to research how to connect when I want to use one.  Overall, I would recommend this router.",

At a point in the set-up process, the wizard asks my opinion whether the set up was easy, hard, etc. I clicked easy, because up to then, it was a snap. Then, when I actually tried to go on line wirelessly, my Window 7 laptop could not find the wireless network clearly showing on my available networks. That is, my network was unavailable. So,after trying for about an hour myself, I called support. After a long hour of noodling around in the guts of the router, the tech basically threw up his hands in frustration ( it was evident that he was out of options on his chart as to what to do next) and told me to call my computer mfg. support and \"good-bye.\"\nHe did say to call back the next day to reset the security options, which he removed for easier acess to problem-solving,but after my experience with Netgear, I do not want that support into my world again.\nI did call HP and was walked through a fix for the router settings and was able to connect both my XP laptop and my Win & laptop.  I am not a geek about this stuff  but I do have some experience, that either the Netgear wizard or the Netgear techie really messed up the whole router settings, including the IP address, dynamic etc, and so on, about which I have no clue. Maybe I screwed it up , but all I did was run the Netgear install disc wizard.\nThis all took 3 hours on the phone and I was thankful for the HP support system and have little good to say about the Netgear system of support.  HP said it would call back the next day to see if everything was runnng smoothly, but Netgear bascially told me to call back for further help if I needed to reset the security removed by the techie to facilitate his efforts, No way would I let them near it again.The router, once properly installed works very well. The large blue light on the top is a bit annoying, though, but you may like the Kmart blue- light- special like flashing.\nWould I buy this product again-No. Can I recommend it to anyone-No.",

I have a NetGear WNDR4000 in my office in one corner of my home, and my wireless signal could not reach my wireless Blu-Ray player in the opposite corner of my home in the family room, and my Smartphone when I am on my back patio. So, I located the WNDR3400 in my family room, connnected the two routers via CAT6 cable I ran through the basement between the two rooms, and configured the second router as a bridge from the first. This has solved my problem with my Blu-Ray player in the family room very well! My signal is stable, and I am streaming HD video from NetFlix with almost no issues whatsoever, so I am mostly satisfied. However, just beyond the family room on the back patio, the signal from the WNDR3400 just 15 feet and one external wall away is as weak as the signal from the WNDR4000 in my office 50 feet, 4 internal walls, and one external wall away, and my Smartphone connection is spotty to both. So, in summary, I am generally happy with my WNDR3400, but the wireless signal range does not compare favorably with the WNDR4000.",

I have a ps3, bravia tv and appletv all setup to stream netflix.  Whenever I streamed netflix on more than one of these devices the streams on both would pause or cut out.  Did some quick research and decided I needed a dual band router and this seemed to be the most reasonably priced.  I got a little nervous after reading some of the reviews but I took the plunge.  It seems with router reviews that at least 10-20% of the people hate the router no matter what the brand.  I was one of the lucky ones that had a quick and easy painless install and setup.  Had the router up and running in 10 minutes and reset all my devices to pick up the new router.\n\nNow the true test.  I had my appletv play an HD episode of Lost via the 5ghtz band and I had my Sony TV play a different HD episode of Lost via the 2.4ghtz band. Both streamed flawlessly with no issues.  I then decided to test my luck and played some youtube videos on my laptop and had surfed the net on my droid.  No issues there.\n\nI will say that the range is only slightly better than my old d-link but the jump from G to 300mbps N dual band has allowed me to do everything I had hoped for.  Stream on!",

We bought this about three months ago and I admit at first i was skeptical because i bought it used.  The repsose of the router was light years ahead of my old NETGEAR, the easy set up that comes in the package makes is very simple to get going.  My wife was able to do this while I was at work with little understanding of how networks work. The wifi Password is printed on a label on the side of the device which is handy for anyone that stops by the house to be able to jump on the network.  I currently run three tablets, two phones, two Ipods, playstation 3, Wii, and two Laptops on our network and the performance is perfect.  I've read a few other reviews on this product and I dissagree with the users that say this router drops thier signal twice or more a day.  My wife works from home, she runs an online fabric company and is never disconnected from the internet.  She has not once had a dropped signal.  I would suggest those expiriencing this check there ISP and possibly understand that the ISP is the issue.  I will recommend this to everyone and anyone that asks me about a good router product. Not too expensive and continues to superscede my expectations every day.\n\nHope this helps, if you don't get it, your loss.\n\n-Vince",

They mentioned that they had it for a while and it did the job while supporting 2 laptops, an Xbox, a PS3, iPhone, and tablet.  I was just about sold on it because I need support for 2 smartphones, 1 laptop, a PS3, a Wii, and a tablet.  I decided to check the price on Amazon just in case and Wah Lah!  I am not sure why there are so many \"refurbished\" N600's available, but after one month in:  no restarts, no bandwidth glitches or delays while the kids are streaming Netflix to the PS3, and no dropouts when in the upstairs area of my home.\n\nSetup was very easy.  While I was scratching my head at trying to setup the router from my iPad, as soon as I turned on the laptop (with Windows 7), the new router was immediately recognized.  I was asked for a new security password and router ID and I was up-and-running.  No software to install, no setup \"wizard\" that asked me the color of my underwear, no fuss.  It just worked.",

The old router was 5-6 years old, so I thought it was about time to replace it and purchased this router.\n\nAt first, our WiFi remained stable.  However, after only a few days of stability, the WiFi once again began going out.  The connection would just continue to drop randomly throughout the day, and it seemed to get worse at times.\n\nI thought perhaps it was our ISP, but after a few visits and discussing the issue with the ISP, I discovered it wasn't the ISP.  It was both of my Netgear routers.\n\nTo be sure, I did some research to find out what was going on and discovered that Netgear has had this issue for quite some time.  It has to do with their firmware for their routers.  After a certain version, this issue began popping up and has constantly been rearing it's ugly head, regardless of them trying to get rid of the issue. It has been an issue for quite a few years (wasn't one for me with the old router due that I hadn't updated the firmware until late last year, which was right around the time the WiFi dropping issue began).  I saw fixes for the issue but it involved rolling back to older versions of the firmware, which I really didn't want to do.\n\nIn the end, I decided to get an Arris DG2470 Cable Modem, which has WiFi built into it.  Suddenly, the WiFi randomly dropping issue stopped being an issue.  It only confirms that Netgear has an issue still with it's firmware to me.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it's a nice router, but for me, dealing with a constantly random WiFi connection dropping is not worth it.  Perhaps if the firmware can be corrected, it would be a good router, but otherwise, it's junk to me.",

                "review_body": "I was using the same 54mbps Netgear router for the last 5 years, and when I moved into my new townhouse, the signal just wasn't enough to cover both the lower and upper floors, whether it was set up downstairs or upstairs. I read the reviews for many high performance routers, and selected this one for a blend of features and affordability. While I work in the tech field, I'm not a super geek and I have yet to fully embrace all the features of this dual band router, but I'm excited to try them out.\n\nI just set up my new router (which by the way, I ordered on Wednesday before Thanksgiving with super saver shipping and received Saturday!) and I love it. The appearance is sleek, and the signal throughout the entire house is strong. Speed tests show that the download speed upstairs has improved 10x compared to my old router, with the new router set up downstairs across the house. I set up the 2.4g band with my old network SSID so that my wifi printer and other electronics would automatically connect without being reprogrammed, and set my computers to connect to the new 5g band. (By the way, as someone who has had to help many clients set up wireless routers, I appreciated the simple directions and color-coded wires - I didn't need the help, but I can see how they would be great for people less experienced with this hardware.) Between streaming movies in the living room and bedroom, and working in my home office, I couldn't be happier with its performance. This is an ideal router for someone who wants a great signal and range, super simple set-up, and a very reasonable price.",

Since it's refurbished, though, it doesn't come with the CD you need to get the software for the product. I eventually found it online by just googling \"Netgear Genie\" (The website where it said I could download the software was hard to navigate, with some pages missing and no search bar options within the site-was rather frustrated by that). Before I found the software though, I had called Tech support, hoping to get a CD sent to me. Before they could even help me with that, though, they said I would have to pay for the Tech support; the cheapest option being One day Tech Support for.... 40 bucks. I declined, since I'm not computer-illiterate and can figure out most computer problems. I figured I'd just send the refurb. router back and go buy one in the store, since it'd be about the same price and they'd probably have the software included. Well, I pack up the router, and realize there's no return address. Completely annoyed at this point, I set the entire thing aside.\n\nFast forward a few days, I found the software online, I set up the router, got everything configured, and now it's working just fine. Besides all the problems I had with getting things set up, it was very easy to figure out, and I've never set up a router before. I just wish their Tech support stuff wasn't so terrible.",

I can troubleshoot obvious things but if it takes anything more than searching the web for an answer and then a subsequent couple of mouse clicks to resolve I am SOL.  That being said here is my review....\n\nBought it to replace slower, older, less secure router that just needed to be scrapped. Also wanted the ability to plug in a mass storage drive to beable to keep music, ebooks, and other stuff.  Also liked the ability to offer guest access as we have overnight guests and family coming over on a fairly regular basis.  Took it out of the box, plugged it in, and it worked!!!  Don't know why I was so excited as this is what should have happened.  Guess I was expecting a prolonged struggle and multiple calls to tech support with few answers.\n\nWas able to connect everything with zero issues.  The router online interface (or whatever it is called) is easy to navigate and turn features on or off.  Can even access your mass storage unit via internet if you enable it to.  I do not because of security concerns.\n\nIf a novice like me can set it up anyone can.  I am sure more experienced users will be able to poke holes in performance and lack of features.  For me it works as advertised and has been extremely reliable since I bought it back in February.  Have not had to reset it once and no known or noticed loss of signal.",

So the router i was replacing was a Netgear WGR614 V9 which has and can still serve it purpose but an upgrade was necessary with the game consoles, tv's, pc's & mobile devices, etc. in my home.  I was also having connection issues with consoles and  gamer can tell you is sucks when you screen stutters, freezes, lag or you can't get an \"Open Nat Type\".  So I find the WNDR3400v3 comes with more bells & whistles than i had expected such as 5G connection option (which is suppose to be faster), IPv6 compatibility (waiting on ISP), Guest connection.  Another new feature called \"NETGEAR Genie\".  This is an interface to make easier so that you don't have log into a browser to manage your router, it also has a mobile/desktop app that hasn't worked out for me so far (kinda buggy)  just to name few.  The setup took less than 10mins considering I was using switching from one Netgear to Netgear and maybe But if your starting from scratch the entire setup may take about an 1/2 hour.

(most won't feel the impact much, but when all the kids come over and hit the access point, the uplink connect is only 100mb so...  I've had to rearrange some cabling to balance that out.\nThe latest firmware has a glitch in it - nothing major - but in order to change the admin password - it says to click an option that doesn't show up on the admin webpage - found out from a forum that the menu option was there - just not visible for some reason.\n\nThis was minor - now that I know about it - but some firmware developer at Netgear needs a smack on the head for missing it.\n\nFinally, only for the heavy it geeks out there, the particular version (V2) of this router does is NOT yet fully supported by dd-wrt (if you don't know what it is - don't worry - it's really for the hardcore geeks who want extreme control over their wifi)\n\nOther than that, this router has been great - and it has a nice outline sitting on my \"geek stand\" with the FIOS and NAS boxes...",

I just plug the printer into the computers USB when I want to print, no big deal. So I give the Router 5 Stars instead of 4. It wasn't a router problem but some IP problem.\n\nI am brand new to cable internet. I just converted from DSL a few weeks ago. I am having some problems and I don't know if its the router or something else. The router was easy to install and I am happy with the speed and area coverage.\n\n  The problem I am having is every time I use the printer it disconnects me from the internet. I have to reboot several times in a row before it will stick. Anybody have an idea what's up with that? I think it might be an IP duplication problem. If it is I don't know how to fix that. I guess I should call Comcast and see if they can get me squared away.\n\n  I really like the Genie download software feature for the router. It tells me everything I need to know about all the devices connected. This is the 4th item I have purchase form Netgear in the last 6 months. I like how simple they make installation.\n\nIn the past I have purchased other brands of extenders, repeaters and just gave up trying to install them. Instructions were terrible. They need to translate this stuff in language the novice can understand. I spent alot of money on equipment I could never figure out and through it in the garbage. Netgear uses some kind of smart technology, it just installed itself just following a few steps.",

A moment later the router crashed and I lost my internet connection. I re-booted the router and it cycled and came back up. This loss of connection was happening about 5 or 6 times a day for 4 days.\n\nLike another reviewer I was ready to rip it out and send it back to Amazon but I calmed down and called Netgear customer help line and now it appears the problem is gone. With the help of someone named Anthony (yeh sure) in India he explained the 2 channel feature and that I had managed to set the router up to use only one channel for both up & down loads.\n\nThat is why it would crash - if you try to up-load something & download on the same channel - guess what - you crash. Its like driving the wrong way on the oneway street, sometimes you make it through & sometimes you crash.\n\nYou have 90 days free tech support, if you are having problems make use of tech support and if you can get Anthony you'll be in good hands.\n\nGoodLuck.",

When the device arrived it was easy to set up and worked very well for some time.  I was a bit sad to find after getting the router that the USB connection does not support DLNA.  At the time the Amazon description said it did support DLNA; the site has now be updated.  The lack of DLNA support has now become a non-issue though as all of my media is in the cloud.  As others have stated I did have issues with having to reboot the device more often than I'd like.  Sometimes it would go for months without a reboot while other times it would need to be rebooted several times a week.  There really was now reason for it that I could pinpoint.  I was about to toss the router and get something new until I came across DD-WRT, a custom firmware for routers.  The WNDR3400 V1 is supported by DD-WRT.  Ever since flashing the firmware to the router things have been great.  I rarely need to reboot the router any more.  Additionally, DD-WRT has a lot of great additional features that the stock firmware simply doesn't offer like setting up an automatic reboot schedule, enhancing power for range extension and a lot more.  I came across a blog at http://lancej.blogspot.com/2014/08/excellent-dd-wrt-router-for-me-netgear.html that I followed to get DD-WRT on my router.  If you're having issues I'd suggest you try DD-WRT before you toss the router in the trash.",

I called Amazon on 10/26 when I didn't see this listed as \"shipping soon\" or \"shipped\" to inquire as to when I could expect it to ship.After avoiding giving me a direct answer I finally got the Amazon tele rep to admit that this item wouldn't ship until 10/27.If it wasn't to be shipped until Oct 27  then there's no way in the world the estimate delivery date could be 10/27-11/01. I then decided to upgrade my selected shipping option to 'two day' delivery.UPS delivered this crappy useless router to my front door a little after two pm. I plugged everything into the appropriate slots&thought I'd be off&running.Afterall so many reviews,here&on other sites,claim this &$%# thing almost sets itself up.Well that wasn't the case with me! I first attempted the CDless setup.That was a big fail!!I then used the CD in a brand new laptop.Everything seemed to be going fine until I moved my  older(Vista)laptop to the living room(in my small 1000sq ft condo)and tried to load a web page.It moved slower than my days on dial up!! I then went back to my other(brand new/less than a week old laptop that was hardwired to the dang router)and the pages wouldn't load!!I then called Netgear support for help.I spent 30 mins of my life on the telephone with a young man who 'seemed' to fix the problem.He made a point of reminding(urging really)me to fill out the questionaire Netgear was sending to my inbox about his service to me. I assured him I would&thanked him(profusely)for his time&assistance. I then proceed to check my email,determined to fill out the form&give the young man the highest praise I could for his assistance,only to discover I couldn't log onto the page.As if that weren't bad enough I then found I couldn't log onto the internet at all.\"It must be a problem with my laptop which uses that dreaded Vista!\" I thought.So once again I go back to my brand spanking new Windows7 laptop only to find I couldn't access the net from that either!!I call Netgear again,wait on hold for a few minutes,and am promptly hung up on!!I call back.The young man asked if this were my first call.I told him(highly heated)it was in fact my third call! That err.....fella proceeds to hang up on me also!I then call back(furious yet trying to maintain my composure)&explain to yet another Netgear rep the trouble I'm having.He takes my information&spends(wastes to be more accurate)an hour of my time with redundant questions&suggestions,one of which being I disconnect my firewall.Now I'm no expert but I've always thought the firewall was there for a reason&didn't think disabling it(permanantly)sounded like a great idea. As 8:30pm EST time rolls around(keep in mind I started this ordeal just before 2:30pm)I finally decide I've had enough!I thank the man for his time then request a supervisor to complain about the two jack rabbits that hung up on me.I'm placed on hold for over 5 minutes before a voice comes on the line telling me there's no supervisor in sight.I finally hang  up the phone!!\nI'm now severly heated up,hungry,and utterly disappointed!I'm disappointed in Amazon for their less than honest delivery estimate of this piece of trash and certainly disappointed&TEED OFF with Netgear!!!!Their product is a piece of useless garbage&their telephone support is deplorable!!!I'll NEVER EVER AGAIN IN THIS LIFE OR THE NEXT PURCHASE ANYTHING NETGEAR RELATED!!!!

It would connect initially and then drop. I spent hours and hours and tried numerous things until I finally realized it only had problems when my wireless printer, an HP Photosmart printer, was turned on and connected to the router. It should have been obvious but I just never suspected the printer was the problem. In searching the internet for solutions to my connection problems I stumbled across the following solution to a similar problem:\n(from [...])\n-------------------------------------------------\nRe: When Photosmart C6380 connects to Netgear WNDR3400 router, internet connection lost. [ Edited ]\nOptions\n07-13-2012 10:27 AM - edited 07-13-2012 10:28 AM\n\nFrst, make sure your router has the latest firmware.\n\nLet's set a static IP address and exeternal DNS for the printer:\n\n- Print a Network Config Page from the front of the printer. Note the printer's IP address.\n- Type that IP address into a browser to reveal the printer's internal settings.\n- Choose the Networking tab, then Wireless along the left side, then the IPv4 tab.\n- On this screen you want to set a Manual IP. You need to set an IP address outside the range that the router automatically sets (called the DHCP range). If you do not know the range, change the last set of numbers (those after the last '.') to 250\n- Use 255.255.255.0 for the subnet (unless you know it is different, if so, use that)\n- Enter your router's IP (on the Network Config Page) for the gateway.\n- Enter 8.8.8.8 for the first DNS and 8.8.4.4 for the second DNS. This is Google DNS. You can choose another external DNS if you wish.\n- Click 'Apply'.\n\nNow, shut down the router and printer, start the router, wait, then start the printer.\n\nAfter this you may need to redo 'Add a Printer' using the new IP address.\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nAfter setting a static IP address for my printer, everything seems to be working great. I haven't tried to connect to the 5 Ghz band yet, but I am hoping it will work smoothly when I connect our PS3. Note, from what I read when doing research the 5 GHz band isn't visible on most laptops.",

It streams well for watching movies, videos, and normal internet browsing at the same time for mobile and desktop internet devices. I am using Xfinity with the smallest internet plan (around 60 mbps max/ 1TB monthly) and currently use between 5 -7 devices that work well without too many buffer issues. I recommend setting it up manually by the connecting this way: modem to the router's WLAN, and sending an ethernet from LAN 1 port to a computer to update the latest firmware (without interruption) and properly connect to the internet. Xfinity login page open up on browser and it connected me to the internet quickly after.\n\nI recommend downloading the Netgear Genie app for your computer to monitor you connection and using the router login as shown on the back of the router if you need to adjust your settings, firmware update, etc. Keep in mind that this router My router is the first version of the WNDR3400 which from what I'm reading came out within 10 years and still works with today's technology.\n\nNote: I ended up ruining my last router by updating via the iOS app and it crashed during the update. I chose to buy the WNDR3400v1 after spending a whole day trying to fix my last router with no luck, and so far it works great.\n\nUPDATE (4/26/2020): I would recommend setting your router to connect your devices using the same username and password for both the 2.4 and 5 Ghz bands. The devices will automatically use either bands to connect to the internet seamlessly. This can be set using login settings on your router.\n\nAlso upgraded from 60 mbps to 200 mbps for the extra bandwidth and phone bundle which works well. I am able to use around 10 devices if I want to.",

Setting up a guest network was very easy as well using the directions in the user manual.  I didn't have to do any other tweaking to the default settings.  And I did the setup using the manual method.  I have a Actiontec router with my FIOS account that no one seems to like.  It had marginal signal range which caused me havoc upstairs in my bedroom tying watch a movie on a ROKU.  I did manage to turn off the wireless signal on that router so it basically serves as the cable box now.  I am now getting a significantly stronger wireless signal upstairs now.\n\nSo now I have 3 networks - a 2.4ghz for normal use; a 5ghz that I reserve for devices when streaming from Netflix and Amazon; and the guest 2.4ghz network.  Sometimes when my daughter has friends over and they are all using their iPhones on our network, I have been suffering because of the bandwidth drain.  I am going to read the user manual as I am pretty sure I can tweak the settings to limit the bandwidth available to the guest network.  That way they can all text, do Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, etc. but not make my movies freeze.\n\nI see some other reviewers had issues with the updated firmware.  As soon as I started setting the router up, it notified me there was a firmware update and asked me if I wanted to download and install it.  I did so without any issues.\n\nI do not do any gaming so I can't give any feedback in the area.  We figured out we actually have 16 devices connected to our WIFI network including our VOIP phones.\n\nSo in summary, a great price for a really nice dual band router.  Just read and follow the setup guide.",

                "review_body": "I purchased the Netgear N600 to accompany an installation of Comcast/Xfinity high speed internet. I had read that they often use Netgear as their brand of wireless router, so I assumed there shouldn't be any problem with compatibility. The cable modem install went fine (except for some lost time finding an account user id that wasn't already taken).\n\nHowever, when I inserted the CD to configure the router for use, something I've done with several models, there were an immediate problem. The first screen after the initial scan informed me that it had detected a static IP address from Comcast. I knew that this should not be true, so I repeated the setup. Same result. I then tried the online setup, but still got the static IP message. I also found that not only did not have internet access through Comcert, but my current ISP (Clear, who I desperately needed to drop) was now disconnected as well.\n\nI called the Netgear tech support (outsourced), who spent over an hour controlling my laptop to find the problem and finally conceded being stumped, but not before trying to sell me a $170 service plan!! She even admitted that buying the plan might not guarantee success for this problem. A total waste of time.\n\nI then contacted Comcast, where I found out about a phone tech support program covering almost all electronics their customers own. It was reasonable ($40 + $5.95/mo here) so I signed up, had a consult,  and was running smoothly in about 20 minutes. The tech told me that the static IP reading is a recurring issue in Netgear software, and that resetting/rebooting all the devices involved normally clears it up, which it did instantly with mine. Why the Netgear person didn't share this procedure with me is an infuriating mystery. Big stike on them for that.\n\nHowever, now that it's running, I'm very impressed with this router. The signal range and strength are superb, even when running 6-7 devices all over the house. High marks for everything except software bugs and especially tech support.",

Looking through the menus/options by going to http://192.168.1.1, I saw that it had many, many nice features that I had never imagined.  Of course I didn't want to use all the factory default settings (especially the router's password being \"password\"), so I made a lot of changes, e.g., changing the regular and \"guest\" network parameters, setting the Address Reservation Table and changing the QoS Priority Rule List.  You can go to Advanced > Administration > Backup Settings to save the configuration to and restore it from a disk file.  However, this didn't work for the QoS List.  After hours on the phone with tech support, I was advised to return the unit.  However, I didn't give up, and discovered this:\n\n  After editing the QoS List, you click on Apply, and the field blinks, indicating (I thought) that the action had been carried out.  However, I had to make several clicks on Apply before I saw \"Updating Settings\" and a running line of squares appear.  Unless that happens, THERE IS NO UPDATE.\n\n  I live in a large house and wanted to find out what the antennas' radiation patterns were.  Tech support was totally ignorant about it.  One tech advised me to keep the router horizontal because \"in the vertical position it may not get a strong signal from the modem (although connected by an Ethernet cable), and the cables may fall out of the router.\"  However, p.9 of the manual states, \"To ensure proper heat dissipation and for router stability, it is important that you connect the stand and place your router in an upright position.\"\n\n  In summary. I give: tech support = 2 stars, device software = 4 stars, device hardware and software functions = 5 stars.",

                "review_body": "Originally I rated this REFURBISHED NetGear router 3 STARS (Original title: Probably good if you are router savvy).  When I purchased this refurbished router I erroneously thought that I'd get the whole package including installation disc.  The reason that I wanted this router is because I spoke with NetGear prior to buying and they suggested this particular router because I knew nothing about setting up a wireless router.  That was the single reason that I bought this particular model.  Ease of set up.  When I received the unit I discovered that the refurbished unit did not include an installation disc (and the serial number was eradicated, which is probably legally necessary). A note enclosed with the router indicated that the necessary downloads, etc were available from NetGear.  No they aren't.  I called NetGear tech support and discovered that to receive tech support for a refurbished piece of equipment I needed to buy the 6 month service for over $70.  You can install the router manually but the whole point for me was to have an installation disc that did the technical work for me.  So when you figure the cost of the refurbished router plus the tech support subscription you are better off just buying new.  (Originally 3 STARS because the description wasn't accurate.)\n\nUPDATE:  5 STARS.  Reviewing the router alone and not having previous experience with other routers I'd have to say that this is a great little machine.  First whether new or refurbished there is no installation disc.  The information provided with the REFURBISHED router was incomplete, misleading and in error.  I had a tech savvy friend drop by to beef up the security so that my router isn't visible to be compromised.  We changed the password which NetGear doesn't recommend (RECORD your PW, etc or you'll have to reset the router to default factory settings and start all over again.  He also set up the router so that it only recognizes my wireless equipment by entering the MAC number (recorded on the exterior of each potentially wireless peripheral).NetGear's NetGear Genie is really all you need to do this kind of security back-up and their 'help' is a big help also.  You may have to GOOGLE a few terms but all in all I, as well as my PC savvy buddy, think that the security set-up for this NetGear router is pretty solid.",

                "review_body": "I had bought the D-Link Wireless N 300 Router DIR-615 nearly a year ago to replace my aging Belkin Router which didn't have 802.11n (and also to connect to my Kodak ESP Office 615 all-in-one printer). That router seemed great at first...until I tried to connect my girlfriend's laptop wirelessly. I tried everything under the sun (with the exception of calling the manufacturer's support. I guess my pride clouded my common sense). Since my PS3 connected with no problems, I attributed the issue with her HP laptop. Then a few days later my PS3 refused to connect wirelessly. I had to hardwire it to connect. The printer also refused to connect...but since it gave me a few other problems, I just assumed that it too was flawed, period. I lived with that crap router because the wired connection was just fine.\n\nFast forward to almost a year later, when recently I purchased my first Android Smartphone. Since battery life is improved when using Wi-Fi I tried connecting with the D-Link...and it worked...for a day. Then it would detect the router, but refused to actually connect. That's when I decided enough was enough.\n\nI decided to get the Netgear N600 because a friend of mine has it in his home, and I had ZERO problems connecting to it on numerous occasions (and he has two laptops connected wirelessly). I also read the reviews here just to make sure this would be a perfect fit. The Verdict: I couldn't be happier with this router. The installation was PURE simplicity (the Router was already on the internet before I barely started the set up CD). I created my Network in minutes...in fact, the only thing that took a while was coming up with a decent passphrase for security purposes. It's that simple. My first test was connecting my Motorola Photon 4G to it...Flawless. I then proceeded to hook up the bane of my existence, the Kodak ESP 6150...which is supposed to be a wireless printer (Which NEVER connected with my D-Link). It worked, Hallelujah (although there was some set-up trouble...but that was all the printer's fault). I also connected my PS3, and that went over very smoothly. Fired up Netflix on it, and I swear this is the fastest i've ever seen it load up. The HD content looked incredible...not a single drop-out (a problem I had with the D-Link router when it was wired).\n\nI hope my long winded review didn't put anybody to sleep...I just wanted to relay my reasons for the purchase and experience with the product. I wholeheartedly recommend this Router. If anything changes, i'll update this post...if you see no updates, it means everything is still rock solid. One last thing...buy Amazon...they deliver!!!",

                "review_body": "Edit: I'm changing my rating and editing my review to reflect the product after I got it working properly. Turns out it's a great router if you can find the right solution.\nAfter looking through the support on Netgears website I found a couple options I hadn't tried to get a stronger, more reliable signal. Starting with the easiest quickest option, I hooked the router back up and changed the channel. We then put one of the PS3's online and started streaming video on both smart phones... we had excellent signals, no lagging, no problems whatsoever. We have since run 2 PS3's while streaming on one phone and playing online with the netbook with great reliability. Seems we were getting interference from neighbor routers. It's been 3 days now and I'm very happy with how this router is working. We'll be keeping it afterall.\n\nAfter reading so many reviews, asking for recommendations and scouring sites for a good dual band wireless router we ordered the Netgear N600. Amazons shipping is excellent, we paid for 2 day and got it the next day. Then our problems began. This is our 3rd wireless router, we've never before had the problems getting connected like we have with this one. We've had a DLink wireless g, that we upgraded to a Vizio wireless dual band N that recently died (6 mos. warranty left but no customer service), both of those were up and running everything we had in minutes.\nThis Netgear however is a whole other story. We hooked it up, inserted CD, installed and then started the process of connecting all our equipment. The desktop being wired and the mode of installation was complete, our smartphones were next, connected with the WPS button easy enough. And then we started on the PS3's. No go. We have two, one in the living room, the other in the room with the router. Could not connect either. Same with the 2 Rokus. The netbook? Nope. None were even finding the router.\nSo began the call to Customer Service. My husband had to take the call because I had a hard time understanding the man on the other side. He was very nice and walked us through a lot of settings (we've never had to do any of this with the other routers), after a lot of checking this and that, changing this and that, a dropped call (but he did call right back), we finally got everything connected.\nUntil the next day. Error msg. on the laptop about certificate authentication, PS3's won't connect, signals dropping, lag problems and the range is not as good as we had with the Vizio. I'm fed up. It's been nothing but a headache so far. I'm ready to send it back.",

                "review_body": "This router is pretty good, overall. Good admin interface (though it takes a bit to remember where everything is, since they have simple and advanced layouts), simultaneous dual-band broadcasting, and USB sharing (x1).\n\nIt does have a few problems, though:\n\n1) Though the page here on Amazon lists DLNA Server as a feature of this router, it does not have that feature. It also says further down on the page that it does not support DLNA. For that, you need to move up to the WNDR3700 or higher.\n\n2) Sometimes something would happen where my Xbox Live connection was throttled, and I had to power cycle my modem and router. I don't know for sure where the problem lay, but the router's the more likely of the two. Simple fix, though.\n\n3) The box for this particular N600 also says on the back that the router supports \"wireless printing,\" which -- combined with the ReadyShare technology from Netgear -- implies sharing a printer via the USB port on the router. Not the case. It's probably clever advertising to make people buy this router, allowing for some fine print and technical mumbo-jumbo to include that support -- just not the way it sounds. You need to buy a wireless printer server adapter (anywhere from $20-$50) in order to do wireless printing over this router's network. Of course, this is just the box. Nowhere on the Amazon page did I notice it say that it supports wireless printing. That was just on the packaging when it arrived. I don't know how old the packaging was.\n\n4) Every time the power to this router is cut, the blue light resets. You can tap it to turn off the light (I have it in my bedroom, so it can be distracting when trying to sleep), but it doesn't store that setting internally. Not a horrible oversight, but still annoying.\n\nAll in all, if you're just looking for a simple router with basic features and that lets you have both 2.4GHz and 5GHz connections, this router will do just fine. In general, it has supported our media and gaming habits without a problem. If you want a router that integrates more into your network experience (such as centralized printers or DLNA media streaming), you'll want to go for something better than this one.",

                "review_body": "Netgear's website had stated that their Genie software was not yet compatible with v1 of this modem, but alas, installed Genie and it works. Although there is a known bug that Genie software does not show you settings for the 5ghz channel, I don't tinker with the channels all that much. And if I do, I access the modem directly anyway. The Genie software is good for starting up your guest network on your smartphone and have your guest scan the QR code that pops up, for access (no needing to type long or confusing passwords).\nI did initially have issues with the 5ghz channel (about a week out)having dropout's. But a quick peek at my network showed an IP address conflict. Once that was resolved (IP Release / Renew), all is well for the last week or so. My suggestion to those who have dropout issues is to be sure there are no IP address conflicts. If you're not a network guru, a way to solve this is to power down ALL devices (even wired devices) that connect to the router. Power DOWN, completely down. Restart router, and then ONE AT A TIME, slowly restart each device. As each device connects, this router will hand out a new and unique IP address and any conflicts should be cleared. This assumes you've kept your router on DHCP mode.\n\nEDIT - I will stick with Netgear firmware as long as it stays stable. If it acts up, I will migrate to DD-WRT (as this is a v1, apparently v2 is not DD-WRT compatible)\n\nEDIT #2 - Have had this router for over a month now. It does seem to need a reboot about once every week or so. It seems like it gets bogged down and starts dropping connections, especially on the 5ghz channel. It will connect right back up after a drop, but annoying to say the least when it's once every few minutes and your phone keeps nagging you that it's connected to your network again, and again. After being unplugged for 5-10 minutes, all is good again. I would think this has something to do with ability to clear it's cache memory buffer? (I'm no router expert, but I'm thinking there is some kind of \"build up\" internally on this)I have removed a star for that, but still not a deal breaker as router has decent network transfer speed and range, and the price paid.",

                "review_body": "A lot of reviewers here are blaming problems with this router on the fact that it's refurbished. That's not accurate. In most cases refurbished routers are just new routers that were returned by a customer, quality checked, and then rebadged refurbished since by law they can't be sold as new once they've been returned. In rare cases the quality check turns up a manufacturing defect, the part is replaced, the router is quality checked again and resold.\n\nI think when people see the word refurbished they imagine something like worn out car parts that have been rebuilt and aren't quite as good as brand new. But this router doesn't have many moving parts and won't really wear out.  If the router works when you first buy it, it's more or less going to continue to work indefinitely. And because refurbished routers are more thoroughly quality checked than new routers, you're actually less likely to get a lemon than you are when you buy a new router.\n\nThis is can be kind of problematic for Netgear because it undermines the perceived value of new routers. To combat perception, they cut the warranty to 30 days, don't include a setup CD and limit tech support to 30 days of email support (no phone calls).\n\nYou don't need to worry about the shortened warranty because, as I said, routers don't really wear out. If the router works when you first buy it, it's going to keep working indefinitely. And if you plug it in and it doesn't work, just return it.\n\nRegarding the setup CD, I think you're better off without it. I'm not sure what it does but there is a setup wizard built into the router and there's no reason to install the extra setup bloatware on your computer.\n\nThe only question you have to ask yourself is do you care that tech support is limited to 30 days of email support? If you buy the new version you get 90 days of phone support.  Whether that's worth the price difference is a personal decision.\n\nSo what's up with the negative reviews? To be honest, new or refurbished, this is not the world's finest router. It doesn't have the same range as the best routers, it doesn't have as many features and it's less stable. People are mistakenly attributing problems to the fact that they got a refurbished model when they probably would have had the same experience with a new model. If you want something with better performance, don't get the new version, get a different router. The Wirecutter has some good recommendations.\n\nPersonally, though, I've been satisfied with this router. For the price, it's a great deal.",

Heat=power-wasted.  But, it is nice to have it around for anytime I want a wireless USB drive throughout the house, which is the main reason I purchased it; I was able to find it for cheaper than the actual USB wireless network drives on the market currently (summer 2012).  Onto the Pros: It works.  It has a good signal.  It has push to connect for dumb people.  It is dual-band which is good for people that actually know how and why to use it.  Cons: it is large for no reason, it has a giant glowing blue light that I can't figure out how to turn off, it runs hot and therefore raises my energy bill.  For almost all regular consumers for normal household use I recommend Netgear Wireless-G 54mbps WGR614v10 because it runs quiet, is extremely reliable, does not attract attention, doesn't run warm/hot, it is all white and looks beautiful, it is small, and can be found brand new for around $10-$20 currently.\n-Adrenaline",

My only complaint is that I had to connect to the management interface via explorer to set up the second network.  For whatever reason I couldn't figure out how to do this within Netgear's management console... but perhaps that's my fault.  Regardless of whether or not it's possible within the console itself, it certainly wasn't intuitive to figure out.  However, there's no reason to give it anything less than 5 stars - it works great, I haven't had to touch it since I set it up, and the mobile device connectivity is fantastic (for whatever reason my old Linksys router didn't do well with mobile devices sometimes).  A friend of mine even commented while using his iPad at my place that his browser speeds were incredible.\n\nUPDATE (1 year after purchase): This router went from never having to touch it to needing to be reset almost DAILY. The 5Ghz network also crapped out a couple months ago and I could only use the 2.5Ghz network after that. Then, the speeds really started to degrade (and not just because I was only using the 2.5Ghz network). I actually got a hold of my buddy's identical router since he had upgraded a few months earlier.... And not two weeks after I started using that - it started doing the same stuff!!! Very unreliable router - didn't last me more than a year. I was worried my modem might be the issue, but then I upgraded to a TP-LINK Archer C9 and it is ROCK SOLID compared to this and all Netgear routers I've ever owned.\n\nOn an important side note regarding Netgear support: NEVER CALL THEM. They are outsourced somewhere, but most importantly they tried to straight up SCAM my father-in-law!!! Quick story: he called them to get help with an older router which I later found out was out of support. Instead of telling him it was out of support, they had him authorize Remote Desktop access to his computer, then told him he had the Zeus Trojan virus (which is a very serious keystroke monitoring virus) that was residing \"on his network\". He asked, \"can I just do a virus scan and remove it?\" They told him no, cuz the virus wasn't on his computer.... And then proceeded to quote him and insist on *remote* repair services of $110. Now I'm no expert, but I'm not a dummy. Viruses can't exist on a router or modem... If they did somehow, a simple device default reset would resolve the issue. I confirmed this online by some simple Google work, then I did a scan on his computer - which found NOTHING WRONG (not surprisingly). Looking at other reviews of Netgear support, it's safe to say you should just STAY AWAY from them all together. Their products too. I will never buy another Netgear product.",

                "review_body": "I got my first router in 2006.  It was a refurbished Netgear, and so when it started showing signs of intermittentcy, I decided that 6 years or service meant I should show some brand loyalty (plus the price was excellent).  Setup was reasonably easy, and I especially like the USB 3 port in the back; this router has a number of features, and I enjoy backing things up through my home network.  It may be possible to access those files remotely, but I have not attempted to do so (Dropbox, etc are simpler solutions).\n\nThe speed is excellent, and the router is energystar compliant.  In 6 months of ownership, I have had to power cycle it once.  I also note there is a physical power button on the rear of the unit, so it is no longer necessary when having to cycle it to do the usual unplug-and-precariously-try-not-to-drop-the-plug dance.\n\nI have only two complaints:\n\nThe router is that it only comes with two feet.  It is fairly tall (a good 3\" taller than its comparatively diminutive predecessor), and one might imagine this would be particularly tippy if the ethernet cables had any amount of pull.  This is not a problem in my place, but my parents have one, and there are a bunch of wires devices to contend with.  I cannibalized the feet from the router this one replaced (also netgear) so that it sits flat and allows air flow underneath.  Not the end of the world, but given the dimensions of the thing it would have been nice to do this without having to rely on a dead product from the same company.\n\nMy dad also noted that in a darkened room, there is a lot of light that comes from that LED orb on the side of the thing pictured.  Even standing upright and facing a wall, there is a fair amount of flickering blue light.  It is bright enough that someone passing by a window where this router was might think there were electronics inside (or perhaps a small police car).  This is readily fixed with a piece of cardboard or paper, but it should be in your calculus if your neighborhood is not as safe as you might like.\n\nOverall, I do give it 5 stars, and I have been very happy with the brand for a long time.  As noted, this is my second Netgear router in 6 years, and I got the same one for my parents (replacing their 5 year old Netgear router).  Save your money and buy the refurb model.",

                "review_body": "I originally have the Netgear WNR3500L first version as my only router. Over the past 4 years, it's been working perfectly. I am able to stream music and videos to from my USB readyshare to HTPC wirelessly without pauses and hiccups. About a year ago I noticed more and more routers are showing up in my hotspot lists and the WIFi interference is now affecting my streaming. So I found this router which I plan to use as AP and my WNR3500L as my main router.\n\nI was impressed by how easy to set this up as an AP. Just turn off DHCP, set a LAN IP outside of DHCP of the primary router then setup your SSID for 5 GHz and you can also turn off the 2.4 GHz radio (not just disable SSID broadcast) if you just want to add 5 GHz functionality to your primary single band router.\n\nThen just connect the Ethernet from the lan port of the primary router and the AP works right away (no need to power cycle the modem, primary router and the AP).\n\nI was super impressed with the speed and especially the ping of 5 GHz WiFi N. To test the reliability of the 5 GHz connection, I pinged the router 500 times and I get the summary below:\n\nPinging 192.168.1.1 with 32 bytes of data:\nReply from 192.168.1.1: bytes=32 time=1ms TTL=64\nReply from 192.168.1.1: bytes=32 time<1ms TTL=64\nReply from 192.168.1.1: bytes=32 time<1ms TTL=64\nReply from 192.168.1.1: bytes=32 time=1ms TTL=64\nReply from 192.168.1.1: bytes=32 time=1ms TTL=64\nReply from 192.168.1.1: bytes=32 time=1ms TTL=64\nReply from 192.168.1.1: bytes=32 time<1ms TTL=64\nReply from 192.168.1.1: bytes=32 time=1ms TTL=64\nReply from 192.168.1.1: bytes=32 time<1ms TTL=64\nReply from 192.168.1.1: bytes=32 time=1ms TTL=64\n.\n.\n.\n.\nReply from 192.168.1.1: bytes=32 time<1ms TTL=64\nReply from 192.168.1.1: bytes=32 time=1ms TTL=64\nReply from 192.168.1.1: bytes=32 time<1ms TTL=64\nReply from 192.168.1.1: bytes=32 time<1ms TTL=64\nReply from 192.168.1.1: bytes=32 time=1ms TTL=64\nReply from 192.168.1.1: bytes=32 time=1ms TTL=64\nReply from 192.168.1.1: bytes=32 time=1ms TTL=64\nReply from 192.168.1.1: bytes=32 time=1ms TTL=64\n\nPing statistics for 192.168.1.1:\n  Packets: Sent = 500, Received = 500, Lost = 0 (0% loss),\nApproximate round trip times in milli-seconds:\n  Minimum = 0ms, Maximum = 3ms, Average = 0ms\n\nI have NEVER achieved this ping consistency with the 2.4 GHz band from my WNR3500L due to WiFi interference. This is why the brand new dual band routers are expensive. It's like having a virtual wires attached to your laptop! I can play 3D online games with ping as good as wired and it never lags on your side.\n\nAlso, the readyshare USB also works even in AP mode. Since my Netgear WNR3500L also features USB readyshare, I now have 2 readyshare storage over my LAN network. The only negative side that I notice is that this doesn't support IPv6 when setup as a primary router. My 2009 Netgear WNR3500L amazingly has this feature which I never thought when I purchased that router a long time ago. The good thing with this WNDR3400 as AP is that it passes through your primary router's IPv6 capability as well as QoS and other premium features, except for Gigabit wired speeds of course!\n\nAll in all, if you want to extend your network or just want to add 5 GHz capability to your existing feature-packed single band router, I highly recommend to get this router.",

                "review_body": "I'm very pleased with this purchase.  Refurbished items can always seem risky, but I buy them fairly often and so far have a 100% success rate.  This N600 class WiFi router is no exception.  Due to reviews I've read, this class of Dual-Band router is the most efficient for most common equipment.\n\nI've been running it with no trouble at all for about 4 months.  It is installed as a LAN extension to the DHCP Server router that is connected to my ISP access point.  A nearby Roku box uses it constantly with excellent performance.\n\nI don't use the WiFi very much, but my housemates use it all the time with a notebook PC and have no complaints.  When I test the bandwidth speed, the results are always quite good.  I tested the range walking down the street with a notebook PC and got about 75' to 100' (line-of-sight) from the router (mounted in the middle of the house) before it failed (on the 2.4 GHz band, I've not seen a connection to the 5 GHz band yet, no doubt due to the adapters used).  I live in a small house on a medium sized lot and can get a full strength connection anywhere in the house, garage, and back yard.\n\nThe bottom line is that this router gets the job done, and quite nicely, for a remarkable price.  It is hard to go wrong here.\n\nThe blue blinking lights (the disk/button on the \"top\") are kind of \"Micky Mouse\" to me, but it does let you know that the system is working, which I'm starting to appreciate.  It does not include wall mounts, but I built a mount for it and put it in a hallway, and the blue light can make a nice nightlight.  They are BRIGHT though, so if you have this in a bedroom, this will likely drive you nuts.  You can tap the button to turn them \"off\", but it still blinks at certain times to register traffic.\n\nThat big button is also the WPS connect button, which is very handy.  Too often the WPS button is some tiny thing with a icon that is so cryptic you can't find it, or tell where it is.\n\nTwo other features I especially like about this router is a conveniently and easy to find power button, which makes rebooting a router MUCH easier than struggling with a plug.  There is also a button the turn the WiFi On and OFF, to you do not need to log into the router to do this, which is an extremely handy feature if you only want or need WiFi on an occasional basis, and are very security conscious.\n\nThe setup wizard looks really good, and can likely be managed by most users who consider themselves \"not all that technical\".  I used the standard IP log-in to configure it, and found the interface easy to navigate, and help was abundant.  If you want to take your understanding of networks and routers to the next level, this one would be a really good choice.\n\nI use one of these, and I bought one for a \"client\".  I'll get another if the need arises... especially if they keep offering this refurb price ($30 or less).\n\n:-)",

                "review_body": "I always thought a router was something you used in woodworking, so this wireless world is new to me.  I think N600 was a good choice for me -- one user, small one-story house.  It's connected to a wireless modem that receives hi-speed internet from the City of Minneapolis service (USI Wireless).  It requires an ethernet cable to connect to the modem, but now each of my wireless devices can connect to the router.  Since I live alone, there is rarely more than one device trying to access the router at the same time, so I don't know how well it would hold up to multiple users.\n\nThese devices are currently connected wirelessly to the router:  ASUS laptop, ROKU video streaming box, PanDigital Reader, and Epson Workforce 840 printer. My laptop can connect to the HDTV via HDMI cable so I can stream video that way or via the ROKU (which is more convenient and has some neat functions of its own).\n\nMy favorite feature is the USB connection.  I have my WD 2TB hard drive connected to the router and can easily read/write to that drive wirelessly.  I can download videos right to the hard drive and play them through my laptop.  It think this USB connectivity is a real plus because you can have a big honkin' external hard drive taking care of backups and big files w/o it cluttering your desktop or tying up a USB port on your computer;  the drive just hangs out on the shelf with the router, connected to it by a USB cable.  I had to do some tinkering in my laptop's Control Panel to make things work, but it wasn't rocket science.\n\nI kinda dig the flickering blue circle of LEDs, but it is nice to know that they can be toggled on or off.\n\nOnly two complaints, and only one is definitely Netgear's problem (hence the 4-stars):  the setup instructions and the installation DVD are a little confusing and contradictory, especially if you're a novice as I was.  Several steps on the quick-install handout are performed before it directs you to launch the installation DVD, then the same steps appear on the DVD itself.  Being a router rookie, I didn't have the savvy to skip over those steps.  It led to lots of repetitive plugging, unplugging, powering up and down -- but finally everything worked.  If you get this router, I'd advise you to just to load and run the DVD and follow the directions;  if you follow the printed instructions you'll be repeating steps.  On the other hand, if you're an experienced network person you'll likely just hook the thing up without any instructions at all.\n\nThe other complaint is an annoying glitch that might be solveable but I don't know how.  Might be my laptop.  Anyway, I'll occasionally lose the wireless connection to the router and on reconnecting I get an error message about \"resetting my wireless card\" or words to that effect.  Usually it fixes itself, sometimes it can't reconnect and I have to reboot.  Related -- when my laptop goes to sleep it doesn't automatically reconnect to the router on awakening, even though I've defined it as the default wireless connection.  Instead it tries connecting to a different wireless network.  That results in a few screens to wade through to reset it.  Once I'm properly connected it works great.\n\nSO -- I'm very satisfied with this router and it's sweet to be wireless throughout my little house.  Well worth the cost.",

                "review_body": "At under $30, this N, dual band router is a great choice.  The router worked, unsecured, as soon as I connected it.  By logging into it's setup page, it was easy to set up the SSID and pass-phrase (= password) for each band.  (This router has a \"normal' 2.4 GHz band, and also a 5 GHz band, hence \"dual-band\").\n\nThis router replaced an older Linksys \"b/g\" router, which is ok up to 54 Mbps (mega bits per second).  That is way faster than the bandwidth that Cablevision provides, so, on paper at least, the old router was more than adequate.  But, my new Dell Inspiron only measured 9 Mbps download and 3 Mbps upload.  My wife's HP Pavilion Dv6 measured a miserable 2 Mbps download and 1 Mbps upload speed whatever we did, or wherever we placed the laptop.  (I use Speedtest.net by Ookla for these numbers).  The other \"issue\" with the Linksys was drop-outs, now happening every couple of days as the unit got older.\n\nThe new NETGEAR WNDR3400 router has changed all that.  The Dell Inspiron now measures 17 Mbps download, and 5 Mbps upload.  The HP Pavilion is almost the same: 16 down and 5 up - what a difference in web performance!  (note - the \"N\" band supports up to 145 Mbps on the 2.4 GHz band, but in our case it is limited by the incoming Cablevision signal.)\n\nI connected a Seagate \"Go Flex\" 2 TB NAS (= network attached storage) drive to the USB port on the Netgear router.  The NAS drive continued to connect and operate as it did on the old router, with no change or adjustment.  One difference, though, is how much faster the initial backup takes place after you start up either laptop.\n\nOne other point - neither of the laptops can see the 5 GHz signal, but my Samsung 4G LTE phone, my company Dell Latitude and a Motorola Zoom tablet can see and connect to the 5G signal.  That's cool, but the download and upload speeds are exactly the same on the 5G band,  because it is limited by the incoming Cablevision signal.\n\nI fitted the plastic feet (included), so this router stands upright, takes less shelf space than the older Linksys, and probably cools better.  Remember to remove the plastic sheets protecting the front and back surfaces, which block the cooling vents around the edges.  An Ethernet cable is included, which I used during setup - it's just quicker and easier than doing the setup wirelessly.\n\nDuring setup, I opted to use the higher security \"WPA2-PSK [AES]\" setting.  The older router used WPA-PSK.  I used the same SSID and passphrase as the old router, but because I changed the security setting, I had to \"reconnect\" the other devices in the house - Smart TV, Blue Ray Disk, ROKU, tablets and laptops.  This only took a minute or so for each unit.\n\nAny downsides?  The setup screen does take almost a minute to save each change that you make, but you will only ever do this setup once, so who cares?  The refurbished unit does not include the setup instructions, but does give you a link to the user manual on line (if you need it, download the manual BEFORE you disconnect the old router - duh!)  Both are minor points, considering how much less you pay for the refurbished unit.\n\nSo far, no dropouts in the week or so that it has been installed - hooray!.  Easy setup, much better performance, and all for less than $30!",

                "review_body": "I didn't bother to proofread my review, so bear with me if I make a few mistakes here or there. I bought this router because I did not want to be a victim of Time Warner Cable's leased products. The router is in great condition and is almost like new. There was no CD or guide in the box that it came with, so I connected it to my modem, which is a Motorola SB6141 (they work great together, by the way), plugged the Ethernet cable into my computer, and I soon had access to the Internet. Then I went to http://192.168.1.1, and set up my router and WiFi there, along with security like WPA2-PSK. Use this site to help you set up your router: http://kb.netgear.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/20302. Also, through checking out Netgear's downloads for devices, I found that this series had multiple versions, like v1, v2, and so on, and that the router I received was v1. I'm not sure if this was specified in the description, but I didn't see anything, and people are still asking questions in the Q&A section. I don't don't really mind which version I got because everything is working great, but some people report that they're receiving v1's or v2's, and it might not be possible to guarantee a specific version Anyways, I have tablets, smartphones, and game consoles in the house, and they all work great with this router. I use the 2.4GHz band for low bandwidth devices like my mom's tablet, and 5GHz for when I stream Netflix, Hulu, etc., or when I play MMORPGs.\n\nI've seen some people complaining about how the router stops working a few months or even a few weeks after purchase and blame it on the fact that the router is refurbished. To be honest, I don't know if that is the actually reason why this occurs, but it doesn't seem to occur too often amongst customers, so I hope that this will not happen to me. If it does happen, then hey, it's my own fault for wanting to be cheap and buying a refurbished product instead of a new one.\n\nAnyways, moving on to function and reliability, this router is great! The speed of the internet plan I pay for is 15 Mbps (there is a difference between MB/s and Mbps, as 8 Mb = 1 MB), and after doing a speed test at speedtest.net, my ping is 9-11 ms, and my download speed ranged from 14-16 Mbps (usually 16 Mbps), which is great. So far, there hasn't been any bumps in the road, and I haven't experienced any downtime in connectivity or anything.\n\nIn short, this router is working properly, has a stable connection to the Internet, and is giving me the speeds that I paid for (which is all that I ask for). It also works well with the Motorola SB6141 and is easy to set up if you have basic knowledge of setting up networks, configuring IP address, etc.\n\nEdit (11/13/14): I have been using this router for 3 and 1/2 months, and I haven't had any major problems so far. The 5GHz band is always fine, but sometimes the 2.4GHz band is really spotty and nothing can stay connected to it. In this case, I just reset the router, and all is well again. The 2.4GHz band is a recurrent issue, but not very often; I just reset the router every few weeks or so, not a big deal for something I saved $20 on.",

I couldn\u2019t find any info on how to do it so I had to figure it out myself and I\u2019m sharing what I did to help anyone else who might be in the same situation.\nFirst off I have a router with 8 ethernet ports. Once I had that working succesfully, I plugged Circle into one of those ports, plugged in Circles power, and then comes the tricky part, Circle configures itself over the wifi connection which I did not have. But I did have the Apple USB Ethernet Adapter, and and Apple Lightning to USB 3 Camera adapter (used to connect an ipad to the ethernet cable - if you are getting rid of wireless internet you likely already have these).  I connected my iphone to an ethernet cable in one of the 7 remaining ethernet ports on my router (hoping that would work as the network it needs to configure) turned off cellular data on my phone and made sure I was getting internet access to my phone. Then I opened the Circle app.  My Circle devices and profiles from prior were all still in place! I paused a few devices, verified they lost internet, and then resumed their internet usage. Then I unplugged my phone from the ethernet cable, turned cellular data back on, and paused devices again, and everything was working as it should.\nI hope that helps someone. I am not techy at all so I probably can\u2019t help you, but I got lucky and maybe you will too.",

However in the long run the time and effort it would take to build, configure and maintain would have been seriously prohibitive.\nThe user interface is pretty intuitive, and overall it does really well right out of the box.  However if you are going to add custom site filters you should be aware that many applications can use make connections to external urls or sites for information.  For instance let's take the mobile game Geometry Dash.. A very important game to my son, but shortly after installing the circle he was playing his game perfectly fine until he wanted to download a custom soundtrack tied to a custom level.\nTurns out that Geometry Dash uses an external site to host those songs so I had to whitelist the urls that I saw his tablet trying to reach. (See the attachment)\nThe big gotcha to this product is age.. when the child gets outside the present age categories you are probably going to have to create a new custom profile.

We saw an ad for the Circle and decided we'd give it a shot.\n\nSetup was pretty easy.  There are quite a few steps but the instructions guide you through the process.  If you know how to pick a Wi-fi station on your iPad, you can get through it.\n\nWe then setup some initial times for our son's iPad.  Worked like a charm.\n\nWe ended up configuring our personal iPhones and iPads to unrestricted filters.  That way, the wife and I can have private browsing.\n\nThere is one complaint.  And a possible product selection for the Circle team.\n\nOur kids share an iPad.  Unfortunately, for a single device you can't select that Suzy is using it now and then switch over to Billy when he starts using it.  It would be nice to have a simple app / site that can tell the circle that a different user is on the device.\n\nWe also had some devices on our network we don't recognize.  The Circle should provide more information about devices and how to figure them out.\n\nOverall, a great product.  It's amazing.  The filtering is good.  We really like the ability to dig into the web traffic -- the \"history\" section -- to see what's going on.\n\nAs an anecdote, our son emptied the dish washer WITHOUT BEING ASKED.  Let that sink in for a second, parents.  Earlier we showed him the \"reward\" button and told him he could earn more screen time by doing chores.  #winning",

The biggest issue there was no written instructions provided and had to research what was to happen during the setup phase. You must have a mobile phone or tablet to perform the setup. Since I only use Android devices the Circle app was not stable. After contacting technical support the had to release a new Android app version 1.5.1 to allow the Circle product to connect to my home WiFi router. Then after a week of factory resets and tech support calls i was able to get working by clearing the app data and cache.\n\nHowever once it was setup the device works well filtering connected while connected to the home WiFi. Cell data filtering costs and additional subscription. Also if the device leaves the home and is used on another WiFi access point there is not filtering.\n\nThe time limitations and bedtime features also work well.\n\nIdentifying each WiFi device in your home network is tricky as you nay only see MAC addresses. The app does allow you to give each device a name. TV's, game consoles, PCs, Phone, Tablets, ...\n\nThe tech support is good.

I tried the Velop and now have the Orbi and although both have excellent through-put and range (I have Cox Gigablast so routinely see 250-350 Mpbs in every corner of my 4,100 sf, 2 story house), neither of them have effective parental controls so I was forced to buy Circle.  I wasn't thrilled about spending another $100 but didnt have much of a choice given my situation, however I was glad I did!\n\nSet up was so simple, Circle connected to my network immediately, identified all of the devices on my network and allowed me to set up profiles for every member of my family based on their age and usage preferences.  Each kid's profile can be set up based on what you want/don't want them to have access to and they have some pre-sets already loaded but it even let's you customize it more down to the App level.  IE: If you don't want them on YouTube, simply restrict access to it.  In addition, I'm finally I'm able to \"shut off\" the internet completely at bed time, limit internet usage to X hrs a day, give \"extra internet time\" as a reward for good grades and whenever one of their friends comes over, assign their device to the same protected profile so they too are prevented from accessing inappropriate content just like my kids are.  I'm able to manage and monitor everything my kids now do online and finally have piece of mind knowing they are protected.\n\nPut simply, Circle simply works and I would highly recommend it.",

I can easily limit the content my kids see, the total daily time they spend on the Internet as well as the hours of the day they are on.  You can also review where they are spending their time online.\n\nCons: You can't layer profiles into groups.  For example, I'd like to be able to have all kids in one group so I can pause their usage until all chores are done without going into each profile to do it.  Probably a picky point, but I have 7 kids!  I'd like more detailed time limit and time of day scheduling.  Maybe an option to get more detailed if one wants to.  So that you could have different setting for weekends, for example.  As others have mentioned, it's simple to defeat if it's somewhere that the kids can get to it.  Although if your kids can't be told \"don't touch that thing\" and have them respect that, you probably should just take their deceive away permanently.\n\nOthers have also mentioned that these things can be done with most routers inside DDWRT.  Technically true, but Id much rather just pay $99 and use the circle.  Much faster, easier and basic than doing it manually.  Worth the money.  It works.",

If they act out or disobey, I pause their internet. This really drives them crazy. I don't do it to be mean, but rather to prove a point. They live under my roof and I provide for them and they will obey our rules.\n\nI love the fact that I can filter different levels for my different kids. My older teens are able to have a little more freedom than my younger teens. The app makes this quite easy to set up and control.\n\nI love the fact that they each have wifi bedtimes and I have a wifi bedtime set for our house. Before Circle, I used to keep the router by my bedside and turn it off when I went to bed. This was effective when the kids were preteens, but not for the last few years. After that, but prior to Circle, I had to leave the wifi on after my bedtime so my high school kids could submit work to their teachers. I finally have a device that allows me to set limits both on time and on content for all of my kids. I also have limits and restrictions set for the house which covers all of their friends when they come over.\n\nCircle has also become a great way to teach my kids how to ask and support their requests with reason when they think that they need a particular website or feature allowed for their profile.\nBecause the app is on my phone I'm able to make adjustments to any user at home when I am away!",

I had a second router running DD-WRT, with a seperate (\"kids\") wireless network and some parental controls, and a timer to turn it off at bed-time. The second router obviously provided its own ARP tables, and made the Circle less effective, so I had to sacrifice it. In exchange, I got much better parental controls, much more flexible time restrictions, and an easy-way for my wife to \"pause\" or \"reward\" WiFi time from her phone.\n\nThe hardest part, on a big network, is to identify all the devices. I'd started the effort on my router earlier, with the help of Fing, so I had some information to augment Circle's discovery. I imagine this step would be painful for most people. But once devices are identified, its easy to group them by user (kid) and set-up limits and rules that fit for them. We could even \"ground\" my son from YouTube, without having to cut off the girls (previously we accomplished this with OpenDNS -- but that obviously impacts the whole family.)\n\nThe product itself was well thought through, with a decent phone app, and a nice out-of-box experience. Controls \"just work\" once set, and adjusting on-the-fly is simple. There's a few places in the app that could use some refining (like device identification needing you to \"See all devices\" constantly), but overall, this was a really good experience. We had everything set-up in under 90 minutes.\n\nMy kids aren't old enough for cell phones yet, but when they are, we'll definitely give the Circle Go service a try. We're happy customers, and will recommend for other families.",

I am usually pretty tech savvy, but I have hit a couple of snags that I am hoping I will be able to iron out.  I bought this because I am a host mom to international students.  This year, for the first time, I have a younger girl in my home who is still fairly tied to her mom back in her home country.  When I explained that I turn off wifi on school nights, she immediately started crying saying she wouldn't be able to sleep without Skype connected to her family in her country.  I researched my options and bought Circle with Disney.  My immediate reaction is not very favorable because of the following: 1) it doesn't seem to \"see\" all of the devices - and the ones it does see, it doesn't distinguish between them - only giving the manufacturer (apple).  I have 5 people in the home - all with an apple product - so I don't see how to \"assign\" specific filtering and timing to each girl since it doesn't give me the specific device model (5s, macair, etc.).  Also, I can't seem to find how to even know which PC's are which, because it is not listing the PC devices under their names - which would be fine if I could find instructions on how to identify which wifi belongs to whom.  The final complaint I have is that I do not see the option to control a specific program such as Skype.  I have read in a blog that there is a way to do it, but since the device itself doesn't really come with instructions and I have searched on teh circle with disney website to no avail, I am unsure how to learn how to do this.  So, the verdict is still out, but at this rate I will probably be returning the product.",

The children need to be able to text their friends and do their homework and go to bed on time while my husband (and I) want to be able to do whatever we want, whenever we want.  We tried other web filtering controls at our house but it was too hard to set the controls (relying on third party tools) or having to manually update a blacklist and whitelist.\nMy sister-in-law recommended Circle and it has been fantastic.  Not only does it allow me to set up different profiles for everyone in my family, it allows me to modify settings from my phone wherever I am.  So if my daughter needs to access a new website for school, she can text me and I can immediately go in and allow it for her.  I don't even have to type the address of the site.  I can go to the filtering history and see what site was blocked and then allow it.  I can even do it while I'm on a business trip in another state!\nHaving Circle has been great for communication with my kids.  They understand that when a site is blocked it's not because I necessarily blocked it, but maybe because that's a Circle default.  So we discuss what they want me to unblock and why.  And if I think it makes sense then I unblock it and if I don't, we discuss why.  I REALLY love this device and the app.\nThe only negative is that it doesn't apply to LTE unless you pay a monthly fee which I think is a little high.",

I am passing along this info because I know we aren\u2019t alone.\n\nIn a perfect world....where I don\u2019t struggle with severe ADD, I would be able to set technology limits and enforce them. I would be able to monitor which apps our daughter is on. I would be able to enforce punishments of technology limitations through to the end.\n\nBut that\u2019s not my reality and I was really over my \u201cbest intentions\u201d failing me...and ultimately...her.\n\nA chance conversation at the allergist\u2019s regarding technology led to her introducing me to Disney Circle. This device allows you to control apps that require internet (YouTube, roblox, Facebook, etc). You can set weekly schedules that dictate when the internet turns on on the devices and when it shuts off, how many hours it can be on, and can block them from specific apps or their technology altogether. You can also use the parent portal on your phone to see how much time they\u2019ve spent on each specific app, award extra time for good behavior or a chore list, or take time away.\n\nI was unsure if I wanted to get it, despite the allergist\u2019s high praises, because the reviews were good...but not all great.\n\nBut I\u2019m glad we took a chance on it. We\u2019ve seen our child emerge back into the land of the living with family movie times, playing with toys again, etc. Today we are setting up a reward list (extra things in top of her chores that she could do to earn extra time).

It's like Disney had a handful of good artists and designers when they developed this product, but couldn't find any experienced programmers to bring it over the finish line properly.\n\nI set the Circle device up then went to sleep. Next day, I was greeted with \"circle not found\" and spotty Internet access (some devices were completely blocked, others had very slow Internet, others had intermittent access). I had to reset the Circle to make it visible to the app again, but then the app asked me to go through setting profiles up again (and there was no way to skip the step, even though my old profiles were still there).\n\nI couldn't find out why some devices simply weren't allowed online, because there is no useful technical info anywhere in sight, and the only access is through the limited mobile app. I tried changing settings around (profile, filtering, etc), but with no results. I rebooted all involved parties - even my trusted router which hadn't been rebooted in many months.\nI should point out that I have professional network admin and network programming experience, yet found no way to get all my devices back online, other than disabling the circle.\n(This may work better when integrated with a router, but that product is a money grab by requiring a subscription for feature parity with the standalone device.)\n\nWhen you look at the activity history, clearly this is an unrefined release: background activity is misclassified under various categories, websites are shown by name only (e.g. \"google.com\" but with no detail whatsoever), and sometimes even mysteriously truncated (e.g. \"google.\" instead of \"google.com\"). Other websites are only shown by IP address, leaving the name lookup as homework for the user.\n\nTech support seems nice, but you can only help so much with a broken product. The rest is \"we are sorry, here is why it doesn't work\".\n\nTerribly disappointed. Was looking forward to having a central management point for parental controls, as well as exploring the automation part. I'll probably go with a UniFi solution instead.\n\nLastly: Circle manages 2.4GHz connections only. Who still uses 2.4 only??\n\nEdit: Per customer support response, Circle manages all types of connections, even though it only connect to a 2.4GHz network.",

But...it has a couple of flaws that are so fundamental, one of which they've caused themselves that tomorrow I'll be resetting it and returning it after having spent a couple of days setting it up and making sure it worked \"properly\".\n\nSo - what are the flaws? Well, firstly, irrespective of what it says in their FAQ, I can't get it to monitor anything that's connected on a 5Ghz band. I'm using a Netgear X8 which according to the FAQ on their website is supported, but since I have every device in my house that is capable of connecting to my Wi-Fi at 5Ghz doing so, and since the Circle seems oblivious to that part of the spectrum, it's useless. All the FAQ says is \"Under most circumstances, Circle can manage Internet traffic entering the router through the 2.4ghz band, 5ghz band, and wired Ethernet once it's been paired to your network.\" which offers NO INFORMATION AT ALL. What if it doesn't? What troubleshooting should I do? How could I identify if my scenario is one that won't work BEFORE I get it? Oooops. Guess I can't.\n\nBut that's nothing compared to the bigger problem.  Circle Media make a big thing about how they've tried to hard for a kid to circumvent it, including a backup battery in case the kid unplugs. SO WHY DOES THE FAQ TELL YOU HOW TO TURN OFF THE DEVICE INCLUDING HELPFUL DIAGRAMS IN CASE YOU CAN'T TELL WHERE POWER SWITCH IS? Great - I'll receive an alert if this happens, but that's too late - that's shutting the barn door after the horse has bolted. It took me only a few minutes to discover that - any kid querying \"How to Circle off\" is going to find that pretty quickly. I'd rather have an option in the app to shut it down, or at least disable the power switch. But no.\n\nFinally, I've ordered both the Amplifi HD and Google Wi-Fi to see which might help alleviate the dead zones we have I. The house with the Netgear X8. Given the FAQ says the device won't work with either of the current Google APs I'm not confident it'll work with the Google Wi-Fi mesh, and consequently the Amplifi either.\n\nI'm returning it, and I'll use a VPN solution to block sites and router based access control.",

You only need to use a monthly subscription if you are trying to manage devices outside of your home.\n\nI am not trying to do this. I want to keep an eye on the devices in my house and be able to set time limits and filters. This is a very easy to setup device that allows you to do just that.\n\nThe main reason I needed this over my other devices, is that it automatically detects any device that connects to the wireless, and I can have it put them into a group with the restrictions already in place. My issue is my son had gotten a hold of an older device and was using it in the middle of the night. As it was not on our other subscription service as a managed device he was able to do whatever he wanted, including things he should not have been doing.\n\nThe circle answered this problem and others. I can control all the devices - set time limits, and my favorite thing \"pause\" the internet when I want everyone to take a screen break.\n\nThis met all my needs and has been running without issue for some time.",

                "review_body": "I thought this would be the answer but it was not. I'll recap my experience, but ultimately, I had to return it because it does not work if you have a wifi extender. Even when I called and asked about it, I was told it would work as long as the wifi extender had the same name and password - which mine does. But it didn't work. Depending on where you are in my house, we have to hook up to the wifi extender because of dead spots. It's not a huge house, but a two-story house and our router has to live in the basement. So if a device is using the extended wifi, I can't pause it. Which is the main reason I wanted this product in the first place. Eventually, my tech-savvy kids would have figured this out.\n\nMy other complaint is that it doesn't come with many instructions. So I took a shot in the dark and plugged it in and hoped it would figure itself out. But it wasn't as plug & play as I had hoped. I downloaded the app from the iTunes store, but it wasn't working. The tiny booklet that came with inside the package provided some set-up instructions and featured a picture of the app. But it didn't look anything like what I had. I called customer service, who explained that there are actually two apps. The one I needed has a different name - not specified anywhere. Not even on the website. The one I downloaded, which is the one the website sends you to in the iTunes store, is actually the paid subscription app. Once I downloaded the app I needed, it worked. But then I discovered the wifi extender problem. So I called customer service again who said it should work (see first paragraph). But, alas, I got tired with all the fiddling and gave up. And the only way I'd be able to manage my daughter's cell phone, once she went off wifi would be through this paid subscription.\n\nIn the end, this was not the product I had wished it would be.",

The product boasts a 5 minute install time which was very attractive since some technology is quite tricky & time consuming to install.\nIt worked great the first day.  Sent me messages via text letting me know my boys had reached their time limit or what device they had logged onto.\nHowever on day 3 when my oldest was online taking an AP History test (we home school) the internet went out during the test.  There was no alert letting any of us know he was about to be kicked off.  Then the Circle app on my phone stopped working so I could not go into the app to add more time for him.  He ended up having to e-mail the test admin to have the test reset so he could retake it the next day.\n\nWhen I contacted Circle support to figure out why the Circle stopped working correctly and why the app on my phone wasn't working I was instructed to factory rest the circle and delete the app from my phone and start over.  I did that but it still didn't work.  The worst part was that even though I had deleted the app from my phone when trying to re-install the Circle it would not send me a start up code & I kept receiving an error text message.  This meant I could not move forward with the install since I could not get the code.\n\nThe tech guys at Circle were baffled and after 4 days of \"being held hostage\" by the Circle who had commandeered my internet - even shutting down the ESPN app we were using to watch the Clemson vs Alabama game - because we had met the bedtime limit.  UGH!!\n\nWe think this device has GREAT potential however there are some kinks that need to be worked out.  As is- we do not recommend this device.",

                "review_body": "I took advantage of buying the Disney Circle for half price on a Black Friday special.  We have a 15, 14, and 12 year old, that like many kids their age, spend far too much time on their electronic devices across all kinds of platforms.  We had thought that the Disney Circle would be a great tool for being able to limit that time, as well as monitor their usage to make sure that the teenagers weren't getting into things that they weren't supposed to.\n\nSetup was extremely easy.  My only frustration was Disney's use of identifying devices using their MAC Address rather than their IP address.  MAC isn't always easy to come across on some devices.  Regardless, I got everyone set up and set up their filters and time limits, etc...  The kids came home and we tested a few things like pausing the internet, which to their horror, worked like a charm.  We then tested out tracking their time on various platforms.  This is where we started to run into issues.\n\nThe Circle didn't log any time that my daughter was spending on Instagram.  I emailed support, but all they suggested was that I uninstall and reinstall.  I did that several times, to no avail.  We continue to test things and discovered that while it was tracking and limiting my son's time on the YouTube app, it wasn't accounting for his time on the YouTube website.  That wasn't ideal, as kids are resourceful and will figure that out quickly.  The worst came when we tested the filters to prevent adult content.  To my horror, we were able to access adult sites on all 3 of our children's accounts. (2 set up as Teen and 1 set up as Child).\n\nFinally, after 3 days of using Disney Circle, it started bogging down and locking up the internet on different devices for no apparent reason.  Some devices were monitored, but weren't up against their restrictions, some devices were unmonitored all together and shouldn't have been limited.\n\nI did multiple factory resets and uninstalls/installs, but nothing fixed the issue.\n\nIt makes me sad because I really wanted this device to work and to use it as a tool to help our kids.",

                "review_body": "We bought circle because our oldest and middle children (11 and 8) are needing to do more and more homework online.  It seemed like a great way to regulate what they are able to see and how long they are able to work.  Unfortunately, it really doesn't seem to work as billed.\n\nWe've had it about 4-6 months now.  Right out of the box, we had issues with connectivity.  Circle would randomly disconnect and reconnect throughout the day and night, sending annoying text messages at 2 in the morning. This continued even when we plugged it into the ethernet (though that did decrease the frequency). Disabling the texts means that you cannot properly regulate internet usage (i.e. add more time if it's needed to complete homework) so that is not a great option.\n\nI was willing to live with that issue, but I found that the software really doesn't seem to work.  We left the adult computers unregulated, so we had no difficulties. The problems started with my oldest daughter - it began blocking websites that it hadn't previously blocked.  These were websites that she needed to access for school and after spending multiple hours over a few weeks time, I was unable to modify the settings to consistently allow her to access these websites.  Or, as soon as I fixed one, something else would go wrong.  Finally, I gave up and took her computer off of the network.  She was too frustrated, homework was taking longer than it should, and if I wasn't home, my wife had difficulty troubleshooting.  But I figured I would leave the network up so that I could regulate my middle daughter (though to be honest, this was really just me trying to make myself feel better after wasting money).\n\nUnfortunately, the same problems with my older daughter began happening to my middle daughter.  It slowed and often stopped her internet connection (though devices not regulated were working fine), it blocked websites she needs for homework (and websites for an 8 y/o to practice math could never be misconstrued as malicious).  Finally, I was forced to disable it.\n\nI think it's a good idea but poor execution.  Very disappointing, because this really would give me peace of mind, especially since I know my older daughter will someday be interested in social media (that's the whole reason I got the thing).  Perhaps there's really no way to do this right.  It does seem like the internet changes so quickly that it's impossible to block out all of the bad stuff.  But I do hope that something better comes along soon.\n\nFinal verdict: save your money.",

I did have a hard time figuring out what device was whose as we didn't have all the computers and such named.  But we figured it out eventually (I think..ha!).  My only thing that I wished it would do as far as family computers where many are logging into the same computer, I wish that it had a way to log in with a password for each individual.  We have 2 computers that are for general family usage. We are a large family and homeschool, so we have computers that everyone uses...not just one person.  Adults, kids and teens.

Circle has been a real peace of mind for me and my husband.  The kids might have a different opinion LOL.  Circle has made me more aware of how much time my kids spend online playing games or playing Xbox, etc.  It has also made the grown-ups more aware of the time they spend online and on Netflix!  When we first got the product, my 15-year-old daughter said jokingly, \u201cDisney, how could you do this to me!\u201d  She cracks me up!\n\nIf I had to choose one thing I loved about Circle the most, it would be its ability to set different times for all three kids.  It has been difficult to \u201cground\u201d one child without punishing the other two at the same time. How do you turn off the internet for one kid only? Not to mention pausing the internet/games for different kids based on various reasons (no chores done, homework, etc.)  Oh, and I have also loved the ability to see what sites my kids have been filtered from.  This way I have been able to let the kids enjoy their summer break even if I am away from home, but they know Mom is watching at all times and can pause the playing when needed.\n\nI could go on and on about Circle.  One happy customer here.\n\nI do think I will discontinue my Circle Go subscription.  The kids can\u2019t watch Netflix with it for some reason.  But the idea of it is amazing!

It does what it says it will do - I was able to set a reasonable internet bedtime, and accurately keep track of the time spent using the Wi-Fi. The device does cut off access when limits are reached, or when the pause button is pressed, but there is some lag with YouTube - usually the kids are able to finish their video before they get kicked off. The effect with online games is more immediate. One note: some apps use the Wi-Fi in the background, so devices need to be completely turned off when not in use or that will eat up the allowed time. Also, my kids use Kindle Fires, and the notifications that they are supposed to get when they are out of time don't show properly - instead there is a warning that there is a security problem, something the FAQ on the help site said might happen.  If they click on \"Ignore and Continue,\" they are taken to the proper page, but I'm pretty sure I don't want them to get in the habit of choosing that!  Looking forward to the Android version of Circle Go, hopefully by the time that is ready some of these issues will be resolved.\n\nThe interface on my iPhone is simple and easy to use.",

                "review_body": "We have been using the product for about a month.  It has worked very well.  We have noticed some affect on network speed, but it has not been as bad as some users reported, and has been a worthwhile trade-off to us.  The device really does give you a very granular amount of control for each user in the house.\n\nOne thing the product does not do (nor did it ever promise to) is to show exactly what your kids are looking at.  It shows the web address that their browser and apps are connecting to.  You cannot tell what part of the site they visited, or (for example) what videos they were watching on YouTube.\n\nThat being said, you can enable YouTube restricted mode and ad-blocking mode to prevent them from seeing mature content altogether.  I actually found the filtering options very versatile given the price point on the device.\n\nIf you plan to do a lot of monitoring (rather than just restricting), it is difficult for two reasons.  First, you look at the history for a user, meaning that the history for all devices assigned to a user are shown in one log.  I have not seen any way to determine which device was used (unless you create a separate profile for each device, rather than each user).  The second problem with monitoring is that the logs report minute by minute usage.  Scrolling back through can be tedious, but there is also a category view of usage, so that can help in certain cases.  All in all, I would say the device is more practical for control than monitoring, but it does give you some visibility of content being viewed.\n\nAs has been noted in other reviews, keep in mind that the device and free version of the app do not do anything for monitoring your family\u2019s mobile data use.  Again...I would not expect that for the cost of this device.",

                "review_body": "Unfortunately it seems the Circle has been launched without being fully developed and it hasn\u2019t worked for us as it should.  It\u2019s clear that the usage and history don\u2019t match up, ie. my son's allocated time was up in \"Usage\" but it was clear he hadn't spent as much time as it said he had.  We then went to \"History\" and manually counted each time a certain app appeared and it was significantly out.  For example Snapchat appeared in history 22 times (ie 22 minutes of use) but the Circle stopped his access even though his Usage allocation was 45 minutes.  While customer service was very helpful, they were unable to find any reason why it\u2019s inaccurate, or resolve it.  Unfortunately this means the Circle has no credibility with our 15 year old son and rightly so - it is not doing what it claims to do.  Not only that, it makes things more difficult as he can challenge any notification from the Circle by claiming it\u2019s probably not accurate anyway.\n\nThere are some very clear issues:\n\n1.  The minimum period counted is one minute so even if a single notification comes in from Snapchat, that single notification is counted as a minute of use.\n\n2.  Facebook and Instagram in some cases are counted as the same thing so this affects the time limits set for both and means neither can be relied upon;\n\n3.  In our case, the history recorded when compared with the usage (both data provided by the Circle, not estimated at all) clearly do not match - they are out by a significant amount.  At this stage we haven\u2019t found a reason or solution.\n\nMy son has good reason to ask us to stop using the Circle as it\u2019s causing more problems than what it is solving.  We have had to agree with him.\n\nI\u2019m disappointed we have spent the money on the Circle but have only had issues with it and have decided we're no longer able to use it.  While the concept is fantastic, and the device may be helpful for younger children who are not so switched on to ensuring they get the time they\u2019ve been allocated, it seems that it has some further development required before it\u2019s as effective as it could be.",

                "review_body": "I purchased Circle to attempt to put parental controls on all of my nine year-old's screen experiences--ipad, computer, TV (via TIVO), and Youtube. In particular, I wanted to put controls on his use of Youtube. I don't mind that he watches appropriate content for 20 minutes, but if unsupervised he will watch Youtube for hours, especially early weekend mornings! Circle did not work to block or limit Youtube in a way that worked well enough. The app allows parents to put a time limit on use of Youtube and specific apps, but with TIVO (and likely other smart TVs), using Circle disabled the entire Cable input. This required re-booting all of the TIVO equipment each time circle cut off the time, in three rooms. Also, the Circle device slowed down the loading of video channels such as Amazon Prime. I contacted Circle prior to purchase and was told that the device and app should work with TIVO and YouTube. Nope. When I called for tech support, the agent was confusing and minimally helpful. Circle finds devices with their technical \"mac\" numbers (whatever that is!). The user has to figure out which number goes with which device. This was NOT simple with the TIVO and the cable modem. (identifying the tablet and phones was easier.) I had to call the cable company for help. It turns out that one of the device names meant that it was the router for the cable. The circle technician should have known that. Finally, if there are any shared devices (for example I have a Mac Powerbook and my child has an account on my computer) Circle cannot differentiate between users. I'd have to manually add my computer to my child's list of devices on the app and then manually remove it when I wanted to use it. In short Circle does not work for all of the situations I needed it to and the technical assistance was disappointing. My solutions? I put the TV remotes in a cash box with a three digit combination lock (no more 5:30 a.m. Sat. Youtube binges for my kid!) and I am using parental controls on child's new ipad. He is no longer able to use my computer but will use a family shared keyboard for the iPad. All this is good until sixth grade when kids get chrome books at school and he will ask for a phone every second of every day!",

                "review_body": "I set up Circle with Disney to restrict what my child can see with his Android tablet + an old Windows PC + XBox One, but Circle can restrict content to any kind of device on your WiFi. By default, guests on our home WiFi get child-level filters unless/until I change them.\n\nThere are lots of negative reviews. Circle tries to be super simple to set up, but still seems to confound many users. I think Circle sets users' expectations too high with respect to ease of setup. It does look like Circle tries hard to provide useful technical support. There is no cost beyond the price of the hardware. It works in conjunction with a WiFi router, but some routers are not supported (see Circle's web site). It filters based on predefined age group categories with options for kinds of web sites and specific web sites. It supports time limits and a reward system. It is managed only through Android and iOS apps. Multiple adults can manage Circle. It works best if each child has his/her own devices. It can be tricky identifying which device is which in order to assign them to family members - Circle's tech support web site has help for this.\n\nI had a couple of problems setting up Circle. I tried setting it up with the supplied ethernet cable right off the bat. After setup/configuration failed, I found a tech support article saying that the ethernet cable should not be used until initial configuration is complete. Second, I had to deactivate the VPN app on my Android phone to successfully configure Circle (I have since reactivated my VPN app). Now that Circle with Disney is fully configured, I am impressed with how well it works.\n\nCircle with Disney does not help if your child uses a device with some else's WiFi. You'll need another solution for that situation such as Circle Go, Google Family Link, Family Time, Qustodio, ... there are many.",

                "review_body": "I bought the circle since it sounded like exactly what I needed based on it's feature set.  Unfortunately, the critical elements don't actually do what I need them to do.\n\nWhy filtering doesn't work:  Filtering works pretty well, but it took me about 1 minute to find things that should have been filtered that weren't.  I suspect this is probably true of most filtering software, so not a huge deal.  I prefer to rely on reviewing search history anyway, but...\n\nWhy search history, or \"Insights\" don't work:  The main problem here is they only surface the highest level URL, not subpages or searches they were doing.  So if a child spends 30 minutes doing google searches, it just says \"google.com - 30 minutes\" with no info on what they were actually viewing.  Same thing with youtube, or any site for that matter.  This is exacerbated by the fact that every URL request is logged, so if you hit a page that has a bunch of ad banners requesting other URLs (which is pretty much every page on the Internet), the history fills up with 90% of what your child didn't view, and 10% of what they did.  I suspect there isn't a way to avoid this.  However, the way to compensate for it is to drill in and see what they were actually viewing, but as mentioned, they don't allow you to do that.  So ultimately you can't really tell what your kids are viewing.\n\nWhy time restrictions/limits don't work:  Circle doesn't offer account based support, only device based support.  So for example, on our PC and Mac, where each child has their own account, circle can't differentiate between the accounts.  So this results in almost all our household devices being on the \"home\" account.  So ultimately, you can only restrict time per device, not per user, which doesn't really work in a multi-user household.  This also contributes to \"Insights\" not being insightful since it can be unclear who did what on which multi-user device.  On something like a shared iPad, you can't get around this, but any device that supports different user accounts should have that differentiation.\n\nWe will keep the circle since I've not been able to find an alternate solution but I really hope they address these shortcomings.",

I set-up the auto shut off for all Wifi electronics M-Th. from 5-8:30 p.m. to curb my families TV/computer/iPad/iPhones addictions. My husband and I also tried to pull up porn on our phones and though Amazon Prime and nothing came up.  So that was really exciting for us.  BUT this thing causes SO many problems with our Internet/Wifi devices its constant troubleshooting overrides any benefit we've received from it.  We have an Ooma phone that runs off the Internet.  It's been acting up for the last few days where we can't make/receive phone calls.  I've rebooted it multiple times to have it work for half a day and then stop working.  Just turned off Disney Circle and it was immediately fixed!  Woke up on Sat. morning and we couldn't stream anything on our Roku.  But could clearly see we did not have any problem with our Internet or wireless router. Wasted 30 min. of mine and my husband's time trying to fix it for it to randomly start working w/no explanation. I also have a Smart phone w/only 1 GB of data a month since I'm on my home/work Wifi 95% of the time, but noticed since I've installed Disney Circle I'll have months where my data will be eaten up w/in a few days when usually I don't get even close to using it.  AND I've completely removed my phone from one of Disney Circle's managed devices. But that little white box does something to our Internet/Wifi so it's constantly cutting in and out. You also can't set anything to child because it will say every website you are trying to access is not secure (EVERY SITE).  It also prohibits you for logging onto a remote network.  I actually thought my work network was down when I tried to work from home one weekend and couldn't VPN because kept getting an error message that I was trying to access a non-secure network!  As soon as I turned off Disney Circle it worked perfectly fine.\n\nI'm not the most tech savvy person out there, but I can generally troubleshoot stuff myself.  The thing with this devise is I can't find any useful help/user forums/tips/tricks ANYWHERE on the Internet.  And the \"instructions\" that came with it basically say plug it in, and it's an easy set-up so I don't think I've done something off to make it CONSTANTLY mess with our Internet/Wifi.  There is NO rhyme or reason to it.  This was a complete waste of $, because it has spent more time off in the year we've used it than on because it's such a hassle.  It has not provided ANY comfort to my husband or I to monitor or prohibit our children from seeing something inappropriate on the Internet.",

For example, you should be able to allow both Mom and Dad to control.  No way.  If it was set up and forget, this would be less of a problem, but it is not.  If you want to control, you have to be at home.  If you are on the road, you cannot connect to the device.\n2. No Web Interface - no ability to log into a web site and control devices remotely.\n3.

                "review_body": "This is the best!!  We have used several different devices/programs, and honestly a lot of them you have to constantly re-type a password, a new screen opens and then you re-type the password, etc, etc...  The Circle is a whole different idea.  They have different categories to set each of your kid's internet usage to. Which works out great!!! It works with your mobile phone (we have the APP on iPhone). Kids don't do their chores?? Guess what you can pause the internet. The kids understand that the device is monitoring their internet usage and are OK with it. This helps them make the correct choices instead of just blocking them. They know that if they try to go around the Circle device, that Dad will immediately get notified on his phone.  You can control the internet on each of the kid's devices separately too.  So let's say my daughter wanted to listen to her radio on the Roku player.  He allowed the internet on the Roku player while her laptop, iPhone, and kindle were still paused.  It's amazing!!!  I recommend it to everyone!! Once you purchase the device, the monitoring service is free. The only fee you pay is if you decide to add Circle-Go, which I also recommend. Circle-go monitors your kid's devices when they are not on your home wifi network. If they are using your data plan on their cell phone or on another wifi network (friend's house, school etc) Circle Go applies all the benefits as if they were on your home network through a VPN. There are many more features I haven't listed which you can find on the manufacturer's website. And to those that say their kids will find a way around this device, it may be true. Thing is, that every time our kids have tried to go around this device, I have been immediately notified on my phone. I even know when the power has gone out at the house because the Circle device loses power as well and notifies me! :0)",

                "review_body": "Like many others, I really wanted to love this product. After a fair trial period, I have to say that I don't like it because it inexplicably stops working. We use it primarily to put a corral on our son's PS4 usage. (We rely on OurPact for his Android Phone, and it works like a charm. Before that we used Qstodio, which was also great, but didn't allow exclusions for certain apps that we felt he should be able to use all the time. If Circle had worked, we'd have been curious to know if we could replace OurPact with Circle Go, but no longer see a reason to switch.)\n\nSo what happened? At first it was perfect. His PS4 would go dark when he hit his time limit. Then, after about a week, it inexplicably quit working. I sent a support request to Circle, which was promptly answered, but which provided no actionable data. I tried a factory reset, and it started to work again. Then, a short time later, it inexplicably quit working again. The second time, a factory reset did not seem to fix the problem. I have other minor complaints with the app. It would be nice if my son could monitor his time limit on his phone without eating into his \"screen time\"; he would get mad when the PS4 would stop in the middle of a round without warning. The level of information provided in History is abysmal (but maybe that's a function of the PS4). The ability to grant extensions on screen time is limited to 15 minute blocks, and is also a little awkward in that it makes you recalculate the total instead of just giving an extra block. A collaboration with the chore app Landra looked extremely promising, but in practice was disappointing. None of that would have mattered much had the device otherwise worked as it first did out of the box.\n\nWe bought the Circle after having just moved to a new house, and our internet coverage has been spotty, with the whole internet going down at odd times every other day or so. Is Circle causing this problem? Is it some bad inter-operation with Sonos? I don't know, and I don't feel like hiring a network engineer to figure it out for me. i just wanted Circle to work out of the box, and for a while, it did. But the fact that it quits working inexplicably, and that the support ticket did not help me resolve my problem compels a 2-star rating.",

Circle is the answer I have longed for to keep my sneaky little cherubs inline with the power of the internet connection that seems to be embedded into their skulls. With a single press of a button (pause internet) on the phone my wife or I can summon a small army to:\nClean their rooms, take out the trash, flush the toilet, walk the dog, do homework, etc...\nAlso the unattended features are great. Separate profiles for each kid (individual bedtimes, filtering, etc).  The whining at 9pm when suddenly the internet goes dark is a welcome sound in our household. Well worth the cost even at the full $99 price point.\n\nHey Circle . Earn another star by adding a feature where I can \"Pause All But....\" a website. It seems that kids NEED to be plugged into the internet to get actual homework done now (Google Docs) and the current pause button will knock that offline as well. I'd like to be able to stop all traffic except to just that website without a lot of hassle in setting it up. Maybe even a \"School\" mode where only certain sites are allowed through. Perhaps this is even possible now but I just didnt read the directions (who does?).",

Well I dont know because we can not even get it set up.\nIt's touted as 'easy to install'.  What a joke!  When you try to set it up it won't connect.\nSo you call.  Wait for a long stretch and get disconnected.  Then you call back.  When you call and get a person it is called tech support, but you actually just get a very Disney esque chipper person who doesn't know anything.  She is the gatekeeper.  She tells you to restart the thing (Duh.  As if I have not already tried that).  Why?  Because it's all she knows.  Then she offers to send you an email with YouTube video for dummies on how to reset it to factory settings. Um, hello, I just got it.  There is no reason it should need to be reset.  But you do it anyway because she is the gatekeeper and if you don't follow her rules you don't get in.\nThen you are supposed to respond to the email with some info on your router, the Disney Mac number, whether you have a bridge or extender and your phone e and time zone.  Time zone?  Yeah.\nBut you can call back.  And then you get the same chipper girl, Bonnie, who tells you that there is no way for her to connect you to actual tech support.  That you have to wait for THEM to call YOU.  How long do you have to wait you ask?  Well, she tells you that they will 'get to you' in 24 to 48 hours.  So we wait.  Unless I decide to send this thing back before they find the time to call me.\nI don't care how awesome the idea of this thing is, Disney is uncoordinated about it.  Plus, if they are saying it's easy to install then let's see...um...I don't know...how about you actually make it easy to install!  In this age of electronics there is NO reason why they could not have made the software on the device able to get around whatever router problem is preventing it from working.\nAnd you see, there are LOTS of routers this thing does not coordinate with.  As I was speaking to thefake technician she was looking at a whole list of routers that they ALREADY know it doesn't work with!!!\nSo go ahead and buy this but don't expect it to work if you have a sophisticated set up at home already.\nAnd expect the gatekeeper to happily, cheerily shun your efforts to get in to the actual tech support, Disney style.",

                "review_body": "I settled on purchasing the Circle after doing hours of research on the best device to help manage my kids device usage.  I wanted something that could help manage the amount of time as well as the content that they could access.  I had tried some software based solutions and they weren't ideal.  The primary reason I chose Circle was that unlike many of the other devices on the market the Circle didn't function as another WIFI network, it worked with my existing network.  This was important to me because I did not want to maintain another network in the house.  As a modern Dad a large percentage of my time is spent serving as the house IT guy.  So I want things that work and I don't have to provide a lot of support for to keep operating smoothly.\n\nThe Circle is just that device.  It allows me to manage the amount of time my kids get and it offers good filtering to keep them off of sites they don't need to be visiting.  It does all of this in a way that keeps as the parent from having to hover over my kids.  They know that they have a certain amount of time they can use each day so they are in control of how and when they use that time.  I've tried other systems and they all required a lot of work and effort on my part.  The Circle lets you set it up and it just does it's job.\n\nThe other thing that is great about the Circle is they have amazing customer support.  If you have an issue their technical support is first rate.  Also they have proven through various updates that supporting the platform is a priority.  They continue to add new features on a consistent basis that help improve the product.\n\nAll in you can not beat the Circle if you are looking for a device to help manage how your kids interact with the internet and their devices.",

Built into the router, this product worked amazingly well.  I was notified when a device joined my network, I could create profiles, I could shut off internet access to individual devices or an entire profile, and I could see a log of when devices attempted to access restricted resources.  This product worked so well in fact, that I purchased this stand alone unit, when I switched Internet providers and could no longer use my Nighthawk router.  Unfortunately, there seems to be a problem with this unit being external to my new router.  Whether you attach it to your network wirelessly or wired, connection speeds drop considerably.  This is not noticeable with most TV or moving streaming services however, if you do any online gaming, the latency is so poor that any games that require quick movement or response are almost unplayable.  I unfortunately had to remove this device from my network.  If you can find it built into a router, I highly recommend it.  I would skip this add-on version, because the latency for online gaming becomes too great.",

The problem most people will have and not be able to overcome is setup. Not as much on the circle part but identifying what is what and what device belongs to a person so you can assign it. Take the time to set this up properly and it\u2019s a gem. A few hints: when circle detects devices it will put them all in a group for moving to peoples and kids profiles you create. The difficulty is some are listed with manufacturer name and a MAC address. In laments terms, you\u2019ll see something call Ziojuang device with a MAC address of 0F:01:B1:C2:AF:DD. How are you supposed to know what that is or where it goes? This is where you take your time in setup. If you go to your child\u2019s device, or basically any of the devices, and go to its wireless or network setup menu, some portion of that menu should list its MAC address. Match those numbers to the device in circle. Rename the strange named device in circle to Brads IPad or whatever. If you can\u2019t find a menu, you can always use free safe pc software to do this function. iPad, droid, and iPhone all have apps for this as well. I personally use an app called Fing scanner. It will scan your network for all devices, list all IP addresses and Mac addresses and provide much more detailed information about the device which allows for easier identification and renaming within circle. Once you get this all done properly it\u2019s a golden product. Another helpful tip, is to take all the devices which serve no purpose in the need to be blocked and or filtered and move them to the unmanaged group. You don\u2019t want utility devices being touched by this product. Take your Camera systems, and your nest cameras, your other routers, your network access points, smart fridge, whatever and move them to unmanaged.",

I am hoping it stays that way, this is a great product and all it has to do is be reliable for me to be happy with it.\nLots of promise, but the thing would not stay powered on.  First I used a longer generic usb cord to power it and set everything up.  Worked for about an hour, then died.  No power light.  Keep in mind, this devices is supposed to have a battery backup, so even unplugging it should not power it off.  I assumed it was the generic USB cord, so I plugged it in with the included cable.  After a day, same issue.  No power to the device, no network protection, and no notifications that it stopped working (even though that is supposed to be a feature of the included app.)  I am returning now for a replacement.

It really affected it and made it hard to do much. Hopefully others will have better luck with it, for the price it was a good product just not for us.\nI try to be very helpful and thorough in my reviews, if it was helpful to you please click yes, thanks!",

                "review_body": "Circle was very easy to set up, allowing me to easily set time limits for each child and device in my house, both specific times of the day and total time allowed. Not only does it monitor cell phones and iPads, it can monitor our son's Xbox that is connected to our home network. They receive a message when they've hit their limit for the day (different times can be set for each day), or they hit a specific stop time (bedtime, dinner, homework, etc.). It also has the ability to immediately pause each device or person, or reward more time individually. It also details where time is spent on the internet, by site, and allows me to set by category what types of sites can be accessed, and even block specific sites. Overall great, easy to use device.\n\nPros: Easily set time restrictions for each device and person in the household, individually. Along with restrictions I've set up with the cellular company, I can completely control when and for how long each device is used. It shows the  history of specific sites visited and allows for blocking of individual sites, categories, and content ranges.\nCons: The app fails to open or connect about 50% of the time, which is usually solved by closing and reopening. Can only be controlled when you're connected to your network (can't be controlled remotely). Depending on how wired your house is, figuring which device is which on the list can be a task, requiring determining the MAC code for each device you want to control.",

I can set bedtimes and filters and block websites. It is super easy to use! I highly recommend Disney Circle if you are concerned about your children's internet safety. It also shows me on my phone, anytime a new device signs on (sneaky teenage friends) and I can block them or set them up with pre-kindergarten settings and filters??  This can all be done remotely also with a great, user-friendly app. The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is that it sometimes goes offline and that can be very frustrating if someone is trying to do homework or something important. For that reason alone, I do not have my husband or myself set up with a profile. Disney Circle can also help with chores and getting your kids motivated. I can turn the internet off on any specific device and turn it back on after they have completed their chore. With the Disney Circle app, you can control or block individual platforms on each device. For example, 1/2 hour of youtube a day, 15 minutes of instagram, completely block access to Netflix, allow unlimited access to Minecraft and block specific websites. It will also list the websites that they have been on and the amount of time on each one. These can customized to each individual device or person/profile. I would also recommend watching Disney Circle's tutorial video.  You can get great tips from that.",

I can change the settings easily, but have to change them back or they are on the next day/etc\n\nFirst few days were touch and go, as some filtering was non-obvious... (Instagram doesn't work if Facebook is blocked, etc).\n\nSometimes the whitelisting doesn't take, have to refresh a few times (happened once or twice, minor issue)\n\nRemoving a circle-go device doesn't seem to disable the warning that it has been disabled (keep getting reminders)\n\nDoesn't allow me to set up a temporary profile (if my kids need to use my ipad, they are under my filters, annoying to change the device assignent on the circle app).  Not sure what the best solution is for this, but some sort of profile management on the same device could be great... (may have a secondary app that allows you to change the profile (with a parental control password)... basically minimize the steps needed to make this happen on the fly.\n\nWish there was a way to whitelist from the webmessage that says you've been filtered.  Annoying to have to go into the app to do this.\n\nAll in all, this is one of the best purchases I've ever made... and the price is on point.  Circle Go is a must too.",

                "review_body": "We've been using Circle for about a month, and so far we really like that it monitors the time that the kids are on the internet, and displays the type of sites they are visiting.  We like the 'bed time' mode, which prevents them from using the internet after that designated time.  We are also able to place both weekday and weekend daily time limits for using the internet, which is fantastic!  What I don't love so far, is the difficulty in managing the custom URLs allowed.  I have entered an exact URL for a site, and sometimes the block still remains.  I ended up having to disable Circle in order for them to research a project for school.\n\nAs parents, we would both like to have visibility and control of the kids' Circle accounts, but only one device can control Circle.  If the admin is not available, the non-admin adult can't make changes, or add custom allowed links.\n\nCircle also alerts the admin when it is offline, which can be beneficial if it's unplugged in order to circumvent the filtering.\n\nWe would like to see a more flexible Circle for adults.  We are interested in reviewing our online stats, but don't want to be \"filtered\" and blocked from sites.  (We ended up turning it completely off for the adults in the household.)\n\nOverall, this is a wonderful product for any family with kids that have a tendency to get hooked into their computers, or gaming, etc.  With the time limits we've set, our kids have been playing outside, reading, playing games and crafting more.",

                "review_body": "The idea behind the Circle is great. For a couple devices you want to keep an eye on, you really can't go wrong. However, there are some serious flaws here.\n\nFirst, the way the device works is by intercepting all traffic on your network. If you have a home network that is already pretty active--like mine--you'll see some serious performance issues. On night one, I plugged this into my normal network and within minutes decided I wanted it off because of the performance loss. I was still OK here, because I had a plan B.\n\nOn day two, I connected a separate router to my network, dedicated it as a device for all of the kids devices, and used the Circle on it. This basically gave me an isolated network for kid devices that was ultra protected and allowed me to control everything they did on the network. At first, it seemed to be great.\n\nAs the week went on, the kids started complaining about network slowness as well. \"Kids Youtube\" would randomly stop working for a few minutes, random other issues with network connectivity, etc. The final straw was with the Playstation 4. I hooked it into the kids network so I could control the time they could use it. Big mistake. Any online game from the PS4 became instantly unplayable. Unamanged it from Circle, and problem went away.\n\nIn summary, I'm pretty sure the problem is simply with the performance of the Circle and the load it can handle in a proper amount of time. If I only had a couple devices I wanted to manage with it, then I'd probably be OK. But considering the performance issues with only 6 devices hooked up, it's just not going to work for our family.",

Our kids are at the age when they do some homework on the web and have laptops and iPads etc.  I had heard this device was coming out and a family friend told us they had one.  I immediately picked one up and installed it yesterday.  Set up was pretty easy.  We have a tri band router so the first thing I did was change all the keys to the different bands just case.  Also we had 22 devices hitting the router so you have to know the wifi MAC address of each device if you have not named it.  We had most of our named since I divided up the three bands for our devices.  I then set up profiles for everyone.  I used the teen settings for our kids although they are not quite teens yet and tweaked some settings and put time limits on you tube and of course ad blocking and safe google search.  For my wife and I, I used the adult setting but still blocked adult stuff etc.  Some devices are on the home profile such as Amazon Echo, two network printers, out Samsung Smart TV, Apple TV etc.\n\nI tested the search by googling things that they should not see and it worked very well.  I also tried to go to sites that are blocked from their access and they did not come up.  I also tried the pause feature and that worked as well.  So you can feel a bit safer know thing that they will not end up on a graphic site accidentally or intentionally.\n\nYou can also use it when not connected to the network, for example to pause it while away from home.  I am sure that more updates will bring more features but for some protection for your kids and allow you to monitor the sites they are visiting etc, I recommend the Circle device to those who have the needs I described above.",

My kids have devices with WiFi, but no cellular service. I think it filters web content well, but it lacks in truly enforcing \u201cscreentime hours\u201d if that is important to you.\n\nFull disclosure, We are transitioning from a software solution that worked excellent on Android devices, but not as well on Apple ones. This leaves me wanting some of those features.\nCircle seems to work well for filtering appropriate web content and limiting access to web sites and online games.it DOES NOT however discourage use of games on tablets that require no internet connection. I mention this in case you are hoping the kids put down devices after time is up.  They won\u2019t without prompting, they just switch to the unconnected local games. Circle does not notify the user that they are out of time or their use has been paused, they just can\u2019t get anywhere.. The user cannot request more time via their device. Time limits seem to include background processes when tablets are left on, and also block background backups and upgrades that are scheduled outside of limited hours.\n\nAll in all, It does what it says, and quite well. I set it up with an older Apple airport and a decent internet connection. I experienced none of the set up or function issues some other reviews dealt with.\n\nTransitioning from software that let the user know how much time they had left, made the tablets useless after the time limit, except for any allowed apps (ebook reader, alarm, etc) has been challenging.\n\nKids don\u2019t like it, but don\u2019t hate it.",

                "review_body": "The Disney Circle is a good tool for a home with multiple devices that need parental monitoring.  In our home, we have a mixture of devices that are used by teenagers and elementary grade students.  If each child has their own device this product works very well.  However,  we have one laptop that is shared by the elementary students along with teenagers and adults.  Disney Circle is unable to distinguish who the user is and so it limits the device at the setting you set specifically for that device. That is a weakness of the product's ability to filter.\n\nAnother weakness is that the IP spoofing technique of the Circle, formally known as ARP spoofing, introduces some challenges for modern browsers.  For example, there are many pages from Yahoo, Espn, Amazon that are linked to an ad which then redirects to the actual page.  That redirect is not handled well by Disney Circle and the result is that it says Page Cannot be Loaded.  I see the issue happen across the three modern browsers of Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.\n\nThe Strengths of Disney Circle are its highly customizable filtering.  I love how it can control Youtube's Restricted Mode which cannot be manually disabled.  It is very simple to setup which took less than 3 minutes.  When pages are visited that are restricted by Circle a friendly page will be displayed such as \"You've been filtered\" or \"It is past your bedtime.\"\n\nOverall I would recommend this product only because I don't know of any other parental filtering products that are this easy to use.  It does have limitations that may frustrate the modern online shopper or news junkie. But it does do the job which is filter content.",

                "review_body": "Great Product. I was searching for screen time limit applications and devices since quiet a while. Although we try to limit the screen times, but kids don't listen and when you are not around they start using their iPads etc. All the devices and apps available are dependent on configuration changes and/or apps installed on the devices. I did not want that. I wanted a devices that requires very little configuration and changes to the home network. I also don't like to install apps for limiting screen time because if the device doesn't have the app it won't be controlled. Read a lot of good review of Disney Circle and thought this is the device I need. I was little skeptical that this may not work. Anyway after thinking for a few months I decided to buy it. What a great decision I made. This device works exactly as described. You just need to connect it to your network and it will start seeing the devices on your network. Don't need to install any apps on other devices (other than the device that you want to manage from). I read the reviews that if you connect it via WiFi it slows down your network, therefore I used wired LAN connection. Using wired connection I haven't noticed any slowdowns. I haven't tried WiFi only option. Again this device is what I needed. I did not change any network configurations. No one in my home noticed any difference other than my kids who can now use their iPads only at the specified time.\nI have only one complaint, it has filtering feature, it has bedtime feature, hours per day limitation and off-hours etc. But what I really needed was a feature you can specify specific times when they are allowed to use their devices. It is opposite of off-hours or off-times feature. I needed on-time feature. Not a big deal since I am using off-time feature to define the times when they are not allowed to use their devices. It would have been easier if there was on-time feature where I could only specify the times when they can use their devices, it would have been a lot easier. I hope they add this feature soon. But other than that it is a great device and works very well.",

I told him that my son's love for Fortnite. He showed me the Circle App. I thought this was good. So I ordered one from Amazon. The item arrived with no problem. The problem is with my internet. I had this standard modem/router from my ISP. It's a Huawei HG630b. I installed the app and connected with Circle to do the setup. The setup was quite easy without a glitch. However, there is no usage at all. I contacted the support team and got an email that wasn't too much helpful. I had to do some research myself. Finally after a few days trial, I found that my modem is not compatible with Circle. I even got an email from Circle Support team saying that \" You may never get it working...don't forget you can return it before 10th April\" I was so disappointed and frustrated.\nI contacted the father I met and asked him about the modem he used. He told me it's a Technicolor TG582n. So I bought a second-hand unit for $1. It was like 6 years old. And It couldn't connect to the network.  What a bummer!\nI happen to know someone from a fibre company and borrowed an ASUS RT55u modem. It took me two nights to set up (connect to the network)...It was really stressful because I had to do it in the late night after everybody in the family is asleep so they wouldn't use WiFi. Anyway it's woking now. I just want to say there should be a sign on this page say that it may not work on certain router!",

                "review_body": "First, let me say that Circle has mixed reviews in my house.  As a Mom I absolutely LOVE Circle.  It has been a huge helpful addition to my house!  I no longer have to leave the house with either various power cords, a cable modem, or actual devices.  I no longer have to constantly change the password.  I no longer spend hours worrying every time one of the kids get on the Internet.  I no longer wake up in the middle of the night to find a child watching YouTube videos.  I no longer have to be a NAG (Circle is much better at the once and done announcement!).  I don't have to spend hours on Support boards for each and every device, program or App in my house to figure out how to monitor or use them.  I don't have to constantly reconnect the printer, tv, light bulbs, security system, and every other \"smart\" device in my way to \"smart\" house because I unplugged the cable modem.  I now have control over and knowledge of every device that comes into my network.\n\nOn the other side of the coin my children aren't as favorable with their reviews.  Various complaints can be heard around my house when the pause button is pressed.  Many pleading text messages have been sent begging to have the Circle disconnected.  Hours have been spent staring at the ceiling and probably cursing the makers of Circle.  A large amount of time has been wasted trying to figure out how to bypass the Circle to gain extra time.  More chores are getting done to gain extra time (Wait, was this a good or bad point?) Anger has been expressed when unplugging the device didn't achieve their goal. Overall they feel Circle has given their Mom way to much power.\n\nThe bottom line is, my house is cleaner, my children sleeping longer, and my peace of mind is greatly improved!  Thank you circle for taking some of the weight off of my shoulders.  As a parent I have realized that I cannot do it all.  It truly takes a village to raise a child and Circle is now a part of my village!",

                "review_body": "This product does not work well. Setup is somewhat easy to do as they make it user friendly which I attribute to the Disney branding. But the product does not work well. What I mean is that the Circle is supposed to work with your router and keep track of all devices connected to the network through wifi. EVERYDAY the connection is lost. EVERY morning I run the Circle app on my phone and it searches and searches and can't find it. This literally happens EVERYDAY. I called Circle customer support and they were friendly and all and their solution is to unplug the router and plug it back in again after about thirty seconds. The router resents and after about 5 minutes, the Circle finds the router. Then it says I connected to my Circle and to give this profile a name. I just call it Temp and then save and all my connections are on there including Temp. So I delete Temp and I am back to my normal number of profiles.\n\nBut you should not have to do this EVERYDAY. So frustrating that even Circle customer support says it shouldn't be like that but it is. And I finally went past the 30 day mark and they would not send me a replacement. So I guess this is normal for Circle.\n\nAnother thing I find annoying is that you can't sent different bedtimes for different days. So bedtime for the kids on a school night is 10pm and the wifi should shut down. On weekends they might stay up to 11 or later but I can't put in a different time for Friday and Saturday. Seems like a simple function but its something not included.\n\nA third annoyance is that when you set time limits, you have only a few choices: No limit, 15 minutes, 20 minutes, etc.  You do not have a choice of Zero minutes or block completely. I don't want my son playing online games during the week. I can only minimize it by giving him 15 minutes a day and then he is blocked. Maybe I'm missing something here but there should be a setting for no access.\n\nI would definitely NOT recommend this product. Like I said before, my Circle unit loses connection with my router (Netgear so its a popular brand) everyday for some reason. The Circle customer support says I have to reset my router to get the Circle device to recognize it. I have to do this EVERYDAY. That is ridiculous. That's almost like having to jump start your car everyday to get it running in the morning. This is a decent product when it works although some functions are just not quite polished but the fact that it keeps losing connection with your router, the most basic function, forces me to give this product One Star for review. I recommend looking at the other options, which I won't name here as a courtesy to Circle but do more research before making a decision. This device is Disney branded which is cute but the Circle product itself is not ready.",

If the phone time quit, they would change to a laptop, or something else to get more time. We've had Circle for a week and here are the things that I don't like:\n\nIf you turn off the content filter, it also turns off the time limits and bed times without warning. My kids had a fun day that day.\n\nYou can have different bed times on the week days and weekend, but you cannot have different time limits for the weekend. We have to manually change it every weekend if we want them to have an extra hour on Saturday.\n\nIf I'm away from home, connecting to Circle is hit or miss. I have to keep pressing \"retry\" until it finally works. It works well when I'm home though.\n\nFinding all of the mac codes is kind of a pain. I don't know how they could make it better though.\n\nIt seems to only find the mac codes for devices on 2.4 Ghz and not 5 Ghz. I had to change everything to 2.4Ghz so Circle could see it to set them up.\n\nIf I set up a custom filter for a website, there is a slider. Does the slider set to \"on\" mean that the website is blocked or allowed? I don't know. It doesn't tell me.\n\nBed times seem buggy. My daughter's devices said it was past her bedtime in the morning after the wake-up time. My son's devices did not stop the internet at his bedtime at least twice.\n\nIt only blocks the internet, which I knew. My kids just switch to using apps that don't need the internet, so we need other things to keep track of device time.\n\nI like the idea though.",

                "review_body": "With 5 teenagers in the house, we were getting really frustrated with the battles over sneaking screens at night or wandering away during chores to \"just check something\".  The parental controls on my router are really confusing and didn't work correctly even when they were correctly configured.  I decided to give Circle a try after doing some research to see what was out there particularly because Torch was sending me lots of emails.  It's only been a few days but, so far, I couldn't be HAPPIER with Circle.  Set up was really, really easy except for a moment of panic when I plugged it in and then the light came on and then went off (pro-tip: there's a power button tucked away in that sleek design :) ).  Once clear of that rookie mistake, all the devices currently on the wi-fi were displayed in the app.  It was easy to create a profile for each member of the house and select the appropriate filtering level for them (along with being able to set the bedtime for the internet for that kid).  From there I went to the list of devices and simply assigned each device to the appropriate user.  I did find that Kindle Fires and some other devices did not come through with good identifiers so I had to match up MAC addresses instead to know who went with what.  That's probably more of a \"many device-many user\" issue but still something that a more novice user might not know to do.  While the kids are a little grumbly about the control, I love that at 9pm the internet is off for the kids, period.  No fights, no begging.  The Pause Internet button is also great for things like dinner time when you've already called them and nobody's moving.  One button, a \"DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD!\" rings through the house, but they come to the table.  The app notifies you when a new device joins the network so it's easy to assign those to a profile too.  I created a Guest profile that turns off at the time time as the rest of my kids so their friends' devices are automatically subject to the house rules.  I highly recommend you give it a try if you're fighting the same types of battles over electronics.",

                "review_body": "This is a very useful little device for controlling your children's internet consumption. It took a little while to set up, as all of our Apple devices looked the same on our wifi network, and I had to find the MAC address of each one in order to assign them to the proper person. Once that was done, I spent a little time testing out the features. The Circle app, which controls the internet access of each family member on a parent's iphone, is intuitive and fairly easy to use. There is also a free companion app, called mycircle, which can be download on each device so that everyone can see how much time they have left until the internet goes off at bedtime (which is set on the circle app) as well as how much time they have left on the individual timers that were set up for them. The MyCircle app has some free Disney content on it, but it wasn't overly impressive. The filters work well, I tested them to make sure. On the teen level filter, no \"adult\" content could be let in as far as I tried. I didn't test the other filters as I only have teens. The Circle app also lets you pause the internet for each family member's devices,  or the entire household if you choose. This works wonderfully. There isn't a way to have the internet paused automatically for a certain person at a certain time, outside of the bedtime hours that you set when adding each new person. The pausing at other times must be done manually but it is easy to do and instantaneous. All in all, it's very useful, and since the only cost is the device itself, it is very economical as well.",

                "review_body": "if I could be the spokesperson for Disneys CIRCLE, I would!\nMy teenage son knew how to disable and get around everything I did or put on his phone, iPod, or computer. I was out of options.\nLet's face it, teachers don't accept \"I'm grounded from the computer\" as an excuse for not doing online homework. Wait, what? Thanks for the support.\nThen, I read about the CIRCLE, and figured I would give it a try. It looked easy, had an app I could control from my phone, and was only $100 (which is less than I had spent already on watchdog apps, software, etc.)\nThe CIRCLE can be hooked up wirelessly or hardlined into your router. (Funny thing is, my son had already hacked into our router, and deleted the parental controls and bed times I had set within the router itself).\nWell, the CIRCLE worked great wirelessly from my bedroom, until he figured out he could turn it off while I was at work (you get a notification if that happens). That's when I got sneaky! Since it can be connected to your wifi router wirelessly, I put it in an empty basement closet under the router. It's inside a small/thin cardboard box with a ton of holes, and plugged into the wall!\nAnd, since there are soooo many different options, I blocked his access to our service provider (Comcast) and the web address for the router. Now he can't force the wifi router to \"forget\" or \"block\" the CIRCLE from our network. Yay!\nOne more story... when my teenage daughter is watching tv, she doesn't hear her phone when I call. When I really, really need her to answer, I pause the wifi for the whole house, which shuts down her tv program. She always calls me back within 3 minutes of me pausing the whole house. I love it ;-)\nEverybody gets their own profile on my CIRCLE app, and I can see what type of online content each profile has been to. I can't actually see what they see, but it shows me: 15 min on FB, 25 min spent in email, or 10 min on wish.com, etc...\nI set time limits and bed times, and can filter any device by age group.\nFYI: I've discovered that smart phones will use wifi even when they're sleeping or charging, because email apps constantly refresh themselves, or a different app wasn't closed after being used, so it's 'pushing' content to that app. This counts toward their total time limit if you have time limits set.",

                "review_body": "We have been using the Iboss for the past few years to monitor the interenet use in our home. Iboss is really good but there were a couple of things that drove me crazy. The Iboss router has lousy coverage and the internet is dramatically slowed down when you are logged on to the iboss. We actually set up two routers in our home (one for parents and one for kids) because we (parents) couldn't deal with the slow internet speed but this was a mess for printing. I also didn't like the $60 annual payment. My Iboss renewal came up so I decided to see if anything new had come up. I found the Circle and decided to give it a try.\nIt was very easy to set up each of our devices and family member profiles on circle. My wife and I are both adminstrators and can quickly see the history of each kid including what sites circle has blocked from the app on our iphone and ipad. We can also set time limits for certain websites like Facebook or Instagram. We do use the bedtime feature for weekdays and weekends.This feature was more robust on the Iboss and you could extend the bedtime on the Iboss and it would automatically revert back to your settings. On the circle you have to manually disable the bedtime and manually reenable it.\nThere is a feature on Circle that we do not use. For $9.99 a month you can monitor use outside of your home router. We are most concerned with what's happeing in our home and feel that if our children are looking for inappropriate things outside of our home there is not way to prevent that.\nFor us the circle is a great solution. Hopefully Circle will address the features that are not as robust as Iboss but so far we are impressed.\nCircle's Pros\n-Monitor and make adjustments from Iphone in and outside of home network.\n-Easy to set up profile for each child\n-History of use for each child\n-No loss of Internet speed\n-Easy set up\n-Cheap ($89 one time fee. Iboss is $104.95 first year + $54.95 each year afterward)\n-Can be wireless or on ethernet\n-Monitors all devices on Network including visitors\n-Limit hours of use on certain sites\n-Preset permissions depending on age of user\nCons\n-Have to manually adjust bedtimes\n-Can only set time limits on certain sites\n-",

The features that it used for content filtering and limiting access were not very good and difficult to use and adjust. This app makes setting up usage limits, viewing usage and doing content filtering VERY simple and straight forward.\n\nThe good: after getting all the devices set up and profiles added for the family, it seems to work very well. I am able to see a break down of usage on the applications as well as internet activity. The time limit and bed time features work fine. Kids need to do chores? No problem... I can easily \"pause\" internet access.\n\nCould be better: We have multiple devices that we use. Phones, Desktop computers, tablets, gaming consoles, Apple Tv, Smart TV's, etc. In some cases I had to go in and look at the devices mac address to identify it and assign correctly.\n\nSome quarks: when using an iPad, if the kids aren't playing games that require wifi/internet access, it doesn't count towards their limit.\n\nCool features I didn't realize it had: my daughter ran out of her allotted usage and called me when I was at the grocery store. It was Father's day and she asked nicely so I was OK with her using a little more time. I was able to use the app over cellular to update her time limit so she had another hour.\n\nIf you are a parent and want to get a little more visibility into how much time your kids are spending on the Internet, and be able to easily manage and control their access, I think this is a great choice. I am looking forward to more features and future updates, but so far it has already met my expectations.",

I bought the Circle when all of the options were included in the unit price, so I don't know how the current subscription model works, but from what I have seen, the Circle is only worth having if you have the subscription options unlocked, but not worth a monthly subscription price, I would look elsewhere for some other filtering hardware, but I don't know what else exists.\n\nHardware and Android App:\nWhat I have found is that the Circle does work well when it works.  I have never had a buggier interface via an Android app that what they provide with the Circle.  I would say 95% of the time when I am not at home and quite often when I am connected locally, the app cannot connect to the Circle on the first try.  I usually try to connect to the Circle for several minutes before it will connect (if it connects at all, which is about 50% of the time and then I give up or have someone reboot it).  If you are unpausing someones device, you are typically unsure if it actually unpaused until your child calls to complain that their device still doesn't work, because of the connection issues and buggy app.  The app will show that it is unpaused when it really isn't because it couldn't connect to the  Circle.\n\nI have had the app crash many times and have lost all of the setup configuration for the devices.  It is a pain to re-add devices as they show up in the menu as all kinds of unrecognizable things, if you know the MAC of the device you are all set, but if you don't, it is going to take some work to identify it.\n\nI own both the Circle cube and Orbi router with the Circle built in.  I thought that if the Circle was built into the router, it would be more resilient to connection loss, but there is no difference, it is just as buggy.  The connection to the Orbi, even remotely is rock solid, I have no idea why they can't do the same with the Circle.  Just now I remotely rebooted the router to reset the Circle.  I can reconnect to the Orbi, but can't even see the Circle anymore...\n\nOne thing to note is that if they have an app that is constantly connecting through the Circle, it will eat up their time for the day even if they are not using the device, so really they need to turn off their device when they are not using it to stop it.\n\nThe Good:\nWhen the app/Circle works, it is effective, but honestly I tend to use the Orbi interface to block/pause devices, the Circle to block specific websites and Google Family Link (it is free and works great, check it out) to set bedtimes and time limits on their cell phones.",

                "review_body": "I am the father of two teenagers, and if you have teens you know what a struggle it can be to get them to balance their internet usage with their other responsibilities (like school work).  This is the device you have been looking for. First of all, the easy to use app is installed on both my phone and my wife's, so either of us can make changes when needed.  The app has a locking feature so even if your clever teen can get onto your phone they still can't change any settings.\n\nThe biggest reason why I know it works?  My kids HATE it.  No more arguing over spending too much time online.  They have a daily budget and once it's spent, that's it.  The best part is how I can customize each kids settings. If one is grounded, it's easy to turn off the Internet until they've earned it back.  I was using the built in parental controls on my Netgear router, but the software was clunky and did not allow customization. I wish I had bought this device two years ago when I first heard of it.\n\nI read lots of questions asking if there was a monthly fee.  That's the best part!  No fees or additional money to spend. Just set it up, tell the device which device belongs to who, adjust each person's settings, and your done!  There is an option (for a monthly fee of $4.95) to extend your settings to limit kids devices when they are away from home, but we have not signed up for that service. Honestly, we're just happy to finally have a handle on internet usage at the house. It's easy to set individual bedtimes for each kid, and once that time comes all their devices disconnect from the internet. They automatically reconnect at the \"wake up\" time we set.\n\nOf course, this won't stop your kids from still being able to use their devices offline, but it's still a huge improvement from what we had before.  Setup was relatively easy (my router had a conflict and required me to turn off the 5ghz band on my dual router), but once I did that everything worked!  Also, it was surprising to see the number of devices that connect to the internet in your home.  Circle located 27 devices, and now manages all of them.\n\nIn a nutshell, I can recommend this device to any parent who wants to have more control over internet use in their home.",

From reading reviews I was a little worried about some of the specifics in how it worked and if it was going to end up causing more trouble than it was worth but that all proved to be unnecessary.  I'm thinking that maybe over the time since it was released they have upgraded the firmware?  All I know is that some of the negative reviews mention problems that I haven't seen...so either those folks didn't know how to use certain features or the features were added after the original review was written.  We have the Circle plugged directly into our router (well, actually it's plugged into a switch that is connected to the router) and haven't noticed any issues with it slowing down our internet.  We have two kids in two different age ranges and setting up the specific filter levels was very simple.  And within each filter level there are lots of specific settings that you can toggle on or off (ad blocking, safe search, etc.)  Initially, I did have to go in and 'allow' a couple different sites that were being blocked by default but that was incredibly easy.  Also, we have several different devices that are used by more than one person (kids share an iPad...that kind of thing).  I was worried about how we'd deal with that but it hasn't proven to be an issue...you simply go in the app and move the device from one person to another...it takes 5 seconds.  Even more than the actual filtering, the time limits was one of the reasons we decided to get this device...especially since we're going into summer and I was worried about the kids sitting around on their electronics all day if I wasn't paying enough attention.  I get a little popup on my phone when one of the kids reaches their preset time limit and the Circle cut off the kids internet, this is immediately followed by a \"nooooooooo!\" from somewhere else in the house...I love it!",

                "review_body": "After researching and asking numerous questions to no avail I decided to try it out myself. My criteria was as follows:\n-To find a simple solution for monitoring and filtering for my family\u2019s online activity that was simple enough for my non technical wife to control.\n-To have something that works with my google Wi-Fi router without having to make any sacrifices in range or quality of service.\n-To be able to block specific websites and see what websites are visited by device\n-To apply schedules automatically\n-To have better functionality than what came on an Orbi router with Circle integrated\n\nThis did all of that at no extra recurring charge.\nFor those that are comparing this Circle Home device vs the built in Circle on a Netgear Orbi device don\u2019t look further. The Netgear version is severely crippled and they want you to pay monthly for items that come free on the Home version. I have since returned the Netgear Orbi and replaced it with the Google WiFi router but from my recollection the Home version includes the following features that the Netgear version did not:  bedtime, rewards, time limits, off time, usage.  If you wanted those it was an extra monthly fee with Orbi.\n\nI was also concerned about how it would work with my mesh router. I was under the impression that all devices would connect to the Circle directly via the internal 2.4GHz antenna and render my mesh network worthless. I does not. This device somehow, through IT magic, works as an intermediary between your router and your modem so you can maintain full functionality of your routers features as well.\n\nFor those parents that want to keep this device locked away from being unplugged by a sneaky kid you can use the built in 2.4Ghz antenna to have it communicate wirelessly with your Wi-Fi router. So if your Wi-Fi router is in the living room (for example) and you don\u2019t want this easily accessible you can stick this in your master bedroom or locked closet and have it work the same magic wirelessly. From what I\u2019m hearing though it might result in a slower connection depending on your service, so beware. If you can use the Ethernet cable instead it\u2019s highly recommended. The one thing I wish it did was monitored bandwidth usage by device (eg how much data was being transferred by device) but my Google WiFi router does that for me now.  This thing is amazing and I\u2019m kicking myself for not using it sooner when I first read about it over a year ago!",

                "review_body": "I have worked in IT in an educational setting for about six years. As technology has grown up and developed, it has been more and more difficult to protect children from where there curiosity can take them, especially as devices have gotten smaller and smaller.\n\nCircle allows me to much more effectively control my wifi without having to replace my router. I have four children set up with iPads, phones, computers, and even the Xbox. Recently we added a user account for a smart tv in the basement. The tv is only hooked up to the internet, so the Circle allows us to control whether or not the kids can watch things down there. My only complaint has been that the phones can operate off the wifi.\n\nWe added Circle Go last weekend to keep track of the phones. Controlling the phone access to data is a little bit more complicated. Some apps use wifi time in the background, so understanding the insights has been helpful to determine exactly how much time to allow each user. We did verify that when they use up their wifi, Circle Go does not disable their ability to make a call or text (SMS only). We have run into some minor issues with connecting to different outside wifi networks, but have been able to resolve them.\n\nThe best news is that my children are satisfied. We've had several meetings to discuss whether they want to get a message when they've used up their wifi time or have dad or mom come and find them using YouTube when they've been called for dinner or some other event. Hands down, they have chosen the Circle messages.\n\nRewards are another great feature I have been utilizing. For successful completion of chores, when they are sick, or for a homework assignment, I can give individuals extra time without having to change settings. For my daughter who wants to be on all of the time, we can set limits for her to meet goals and she is held accountable even when she isn't on our home wifi.\n\nIn truth, I wish circle had been around three years ago when we were trying to specifically block Tumblr and YouTube, without blocking the entire internet. My husband and I know how to program the router, so we found ways to reroute IP addresses and set timers. This is so much easier and allows us to filter by category and individual website. It isn't perfect, but I can press pause to discourage my children from growing up too fast.\n\nThank you Disney for supporting Circle!!!!",

                "review_body": "We have an almost 12-year-old-daughter who is a really good kid but can easily spend the entire day online (bouncing between games, writing on Wattpad, Instagram/Pinterest, etc.) without even realizing it. And we were getting tired of trying to explain to her why spending an entire afternoon online wasn't exactly conducive to her general well-being- when she's tired after school or sports, she often sits down on her computer or grabs her phone and just scrolls aimlessly. So Circle is perfect for us- it allows us to set limits and it simply bounces our daughter off the internet when her allotted time has passed- no nagging, no discussion.\n\nThere are general controls, but there are also very customized controls- it took literally 3 minutes to set up her time limits for the day, allot how much time she is allowed to spend on generalized sites (social media, shopping, tv and video, etc.) and we are also able to set limits/block specific sites. For instance, she gets 30 minutes a day on Pinterest and Netflix, but she's allowed unlimited access to her online writing editor, school web sites, online art classes, etc. We can \"pause\" the internet at any time, and we can easily grant her more minutes as the day passes.\n\nAlso, it's made her more aware of how she uses her online time- now that she knows it's not open season, she's less likely to spend a half hour just scrolling on Pinterest looking at Dr. Who memes and cat pictures (not that those are bad things...) and more likely to use her time on stuff she really wants to do.\n\nShe's not into hacking or messing with parental controls I can't say how \"hack proof\" this is. All I can say is that if you need to set some limits and don't feel like constantly nagging your kid to get off the computer or reminding them not to spend hours watching music mash-ups on YouTube, this is a great way to set some limits.",

                "review_body": "Purchased this in time for summer. We have 3 daughters... 10, 13 and 15. They each have multiple IOS devices. I've found it impossible to keep up with their screen time/usage. They are expected to turn in their devices to the kitchen for charging by 9 p.m. or they lose their phones for the next day. During the school year, their day is automatically regulated with school. Those are 7 hours that I know they aren't doing a lot on their devices. . However, with summer coming, the last thing I wanted was a struggle with them sitting around the house on social media sites or YouTube all day long. Along with that, the one thing I hate more than anything is nagging. Circle definitely helps with that. Everything is automatic, and now we can (hopefully) eliminate the 9 p.m. \"kitchen\" turn in since Circle shuts all activity down when it's time for bed. I don't feel the need to chase everyone's device down. They know how much total screen time they get and they have to manage it. I'm also in the process of allocating their Verizon data so that they don't switch to data usage and run up our wireless bill. So far, it's been hardest for our 15 year old. She's actually pretty responsible and feels like this is something for kids. So, we are allowing her to help us set her limits... lots of communication, lots of negotiation and trying to get to the point where our kids know how to SELF REGULATE, which is ideally where I want to end up. Screens are how young people learn and stay in touch. It's not all bad, but some of the apps out their are highly addictive, so we just keep talking to our girls about the value of face to face conversations with friends, spending time with other hobbies, sports, activities... Circle handles the times when they refuse to listen to us! (We've only had it hooked up for a couple days, so hopefully nothing terrible happens. Also, we have a Netgear Extender and it works just fine with it.)",

                "review_body": "As an IT security professional with teenage children, I have been looking for years for a way to easily manage the internet usage for my family. This product is amazing. Prior to the circle I installed custom firmware on my router and used it to manage time restrictions. This worked OK, but it took time to make and changes to the settings. Now using the circle, all the access is managed by a simple application on my smartphone. Here are the features that I love:\n\n- I can easily set the filters. These can be customized for each child. I can restrict by content type or by specific apps or web addresses.\n- Time restrictions based on day of the week, set bedtime, and time usage per application.\n- I can view usage history per child including apps used and web addresses visited. The history also shows attempted access to blocked addresses. This was eye opening to me because I discovered my kids were using VPNs on their devices to get past filters at home and school. I was able to disable VPN use on our home network.\n- One of my favorite features is getting a notification when a new device joins my network. When I have family in town or my kids have friends over, I get a notification when they join my wireless network.\n-Battery backup and device status notifications. During the first week of use, one of my kids unplugged the device to turn off the filters. Little did he know the device has a battery backup and it kept working. I got a notice on my phone the Circle was running on battery backup and I plugged it back in with no loss of service.\n-Additional passcode required to access the Circle app on my phone. I allow my kids to use my phone all the time, but didn't want them to be able to modify the Circle settings. The phone app requires an additional passcode so I can still share my phone but the Circle app is not accessible to them.\n\nI can't say enough about how much I love this device. Also, as I was setting it up, I took the advice from the Circle website and used this time to have a conversation with my children about internet safety and usage. I have had this conversation many time with my kids before, but now we could have an open discussion of filter levels, usage levels, etc., and negotiate more specific usage guidelines that could be enforced through the device.\n\nThe main downside I see with this device is that it only monitors your home network, so my kids can still used their devices more freely outside the home on other wifi networks. But having this on my home network has still given me so much more peace of mind and I highly recommend this device to all of my family and friends.",

I rarely write reviews, however I depend on reviews greatly when making purchases, so I am writing this review in hopes that it will overpower other users who gave it 4 and 5 stars.  Perhaps they have one device or one child, but for a large, electronically active family, this device has many flaws.  (We are a homeschool family of 8, so we are home and on the internet a lot) My hope in adding this review is that Disney would take these defects seriously and make the appropriate changes to their product.  Giving us an upgrade to improve what we have would be an added bonus since I feel that we are not getting our $100 worth out of this product. We are even looking closely into other items out there, to see if there is a better option.\nFirst, Our circle never works right.  Even as I type this, we have not had access to the Netflix feature on our main TV for over a week.  Who knows why?!  Everything else works.  That's this week's issue.\nAs for the App, Both my husband and I are pretty tech savvy but the app is very difficult to navigate. You have to jump through way too many hoops to get anything to work, when it chooses to work.  Many times, our devices are hijacked by circle and I am unable to effect change by using the app.  Everything just freezes and we end up telling our kids, \"Sorry, I have no idea why you can't access that.  The app says that you are able to.\"  We end up spending half the time disabling circle out of desperation just to get things to work.  (and sometimes that doesn't even work!) And as I type this, my app is currently not registering at all.  My husband needs to factory reset everything in hopes to try again.  Who has time for that?\nI agree with other users that circle should be smarter in how they time the internet use.  There have been many times when I leave the room or the house with our laptop open and on, but it is not being used at all, yet it will count as the time used for the day simply b/c it is on.  Spotify is another one that this happens with.\nAnother issue...when looking at our devices through the app, there are dozens listed that we have no idea what they are or how to find out what they are.  It's almost like it is detecting neighbors phones or devices too? This makes it confusing because we now have that many more things to scroll through before we find what we are looking for.\nI could go on and on with our pet peeves.  I feel like this device is controlling us, not the other way around.  This has made our life more stressful and complicated and it is not doing its job at all. This makes me sad b/c I really REALLY wanted this to work as advertised, it simply does not.",

This is exactly what I needed.\n\nThe installation was easy.  Just plug into an electric outlet and attach the network cable.  Then you need to setup an account on Circle.  After this, you need to select the WIFI network you want to control and enter the password - remind you - not the Admin password.  I connected it to the main FIOS router.  Man - this thing took over the FIOS router.  It know every single device connected to it and I can control each separately, assign to a profile and so on.  It works even when I am away as long my phone is connected to the internet.  My kids panicked the first day this thing went into action and displayed to them that their allotted time was up :-)\n\nThe one thing (among many) I like about this device is that each profile group can be assigned timing for individual apps and/or web site, bed time, wake up time, rating and much more.\n\nI can even allow a group to connect to a separate router and treat all users on that router as one group and apply rules on the entire group as a whole.  I usually give my kids access to a separate router and that router is connected to the FIOS router.  The devices on that router do not show up individually but the router is treated as a device and I applied one policy to that router and all kids are covered.\n\nI am a techie and I really appreciate the technology this little device has to offer.  I found out that this device acts as a sniffer and spoofs all traffic going to and from the router essentially IT appearing as the FIOS router to all connected devices.  Google Chrome figured this out couple of times and warned that the site visited doesn't appear to be the actual site.\n\nThis is a must have for all responsible parents who want to know what their kids are up to.  It tells me every site and URL every profile has visited.  To keep track of individual unit, you have to create and assign a profile to a single device. If any new device connects to the network it immediately alerts me no matter where I am.  I love the PAUSE feature.  I haven't used it yet but tested it out and I can tell you it feels like a new found power in my hands that I must use wisely.",

                "review_body": "The best thing about Circe so far is that I have visibility into how much time the kids are on screens.  I suspected it was too much time, and now I know!  I can make them aware of how much time they are using, and there's no debate - the proof is right there!  I also purchased Circle Go, which is great but can be a bit glitchy.  Older kids (12-13 ish and up) may try to find ways around Circle, but you will be notified if it's been disabled.  If they are not nearby, then you're stuck until you can get their phone in your hands to re-activate, or you have to tell them how to re-activate and then, well, if they know how to activate, they know how to deactivate.\nI like that when their friends are in my house, I have some control over apps that are used on my network.  I can deactivate the ones I don't want used for all people connected to my network.  BUT - again, older kids will turn off wifi (then you're in data overages territory!), or choose another network (like the Xfinity general blanket network) to circumvent my settings.\nCertainly a great purchase, and I am glad I have it, but with kids becoming more savvy, it's still not perfect.\nBottom line for me is that I want to have as much visibility into the time the kids spend online and what they are doing there, and no solution short of being a cyber-spy is going to be perfect.  Circle allows for much more control and insight than just guessing, and can help you to create better timing habits and offers some level of safety, more so for the younger crowd, which is not to be underestimated!\nFor non-savvy users, it is very simple to set up and use - make sure to follow the directions and you'll be fine.  Also, I always recommend reading up on the latest updates - they've been great at adding features and functionality based on customer comments and reviews.\nOverall - absolutely worth it!",

                "review_body": "This has been a great addition to my continuing effort to stay one step ahead of the little buggers. It's a bit of a blunt tool, but it's pretty handy.Since the kids were really itty bitty we've had a policy that says they can get up in the morning and watch vids etc on tablet/laptop until the parental units wake up. This has proven brilliant, as the kids now do everything in their power to be very quiet, knowing that once the adults arrive they'll be force to do things like brush teeth and read books or do chores. However we ran into the law of unintended results - sometimes the inmates would wake up extremely early and hit the vids at 4 or 5 AM.\n\nSo - with circle we turn off their devices between bedtime and 6 AM. We also limit their total time per day, and use the content filters as well. It's much easier to get the shorties to go to bed when everything they live and love is suddenly unavailable - the resultant depression seems to make them sleepy.\n\nAlso it's pretty simple to just turn off the internet (well, turn off THEIR internet by cutting off their devices access (I'm certainly not going to untether MYSELF from the hive mind)) at any given moment, as when, for example, we'd like them to look us in the eye or answer a direct question.\n\nAll kidding aside, yes, the most important thing is to actually engage with the little beasties and build up understanding and relationship and yadda yadda, but, as I told my 10 year old just the other day, I wouldn't turn him loose in a building full of strangers, so we content filter not to stunt him, but to protect him. And I wouldn't allow him to eat a five pound bag of gummy bears in one sitting every day https://www.amazon.com/Haribo-Gummi-Candy-Gold-Bears-5-Pound/dp/B000EVOSE4 (that's what birthdays are for), and so we limit his time on as well.\n\nCircle has been the easiest way for us to set broad guidelines and lets us concentrate on teaching the underlying values. It's made things much easier, and I'm glad we have it.",

                "review_body": "This is such a great idea but, unfortunately, not great if you have teenagers.  I have been using this for several months now and even subscribed to the Circle subscription service and have to say I do not love it.  The main issue is that my teenaged kids are clever enough to get around it and the time and other limits constantly.  My kids repeatedly deleted the requisite software on their phones, which made me cancel the subscription service.  Now, I just rely on internet and time monitoring but the other day I found that the Circle Go had been unplugged who knows for how long.  I do get alerts when Circle Go is down but i get these same alerts when wifi is down and other times that are less nefarious.  Like others, because i am busy, I need a system that does not require such intense parent compliance monitoring.  I keep the device because when it works, it works.  I just wish they had some type of system to make bypassing it more difficult.  Anyway, we still use it. I think and hope it is on now.  And this is great for little kids.\n\n***UPDATE - I am upgrading my review from a 3 to a 4 only because I did speak with Circle Technical and their customer service is EXCELLENT.  They went out of their way to address my issues by calling me, providing me personal email addresses, etc.  The issue, however, still remains that kids can get around Circle Go.  And I learned a new trick kids can use to work around Circle Go -- Circle Go only works on 2.4GHz.  So if you have a router with both bandwidths, kids can also bypass CG by using 5GHz system.  The technical support offered solutions for this but everyone should be aware so they can set everything up appropriately and know what is or what is not being monitored.  In the end, I'm not sure if child non-compliance is a problem that can be completely solved by Circle Go but the development team should get credit for their excellent and supportive customer service.",

I've been wanting something that would allow me to monitor what my kids were doing - my kids have no problem with my taking their devices and looking through their stuff. But mainly, I wanted to setup some filters for safe searches and surfing, and setup a \"bedtime\" that would pause their network on school nights. The reviews for this were good, the concept is good, the app interface is alright (could be better).\n\nI am able to identify new devices on the network - great.\nI am able to associate those devices to profiles - great. When a friend comes over, I associate their device to one of my kids.\nI am not able to filter content - bad. This worked for a few days after getting the Circle, but it slowly brought our WiFi to a screeching halt. In my opinion, the hardware (processor and memory) of the circle is too under-powered to handle modern home networks. The device would have been good a couple of years ago, but not enough for today. I'll try to explain why I came to this conclusion.\n\nI have a TiVo based cable system in my house. We have a central DVR box and 3 remote player boxes. These boxes all communicate via IP over the coaxial cables using what is called a MOCA network. There is a lot of traffic going on between these boxes, especially when we are watching television in multiple rooms. I have the Circle hardwired into my router (the router has 1Gbs ports). I also have my Tivo boxes and the Circle with DHCP reservations to make sure that network traffic flows smoothly all the time without additional address lookups.\n\nSo in the end, I'm using the Circle as a simple (and over priced) network watch dog that can only tell me when devices connect to the network and set time limits on the different profiles for my kids. Since I can't apply content filtering to the profiles, I can't get a list of \"insights\" into what the kids are browsing to or what apps they are using.",

                "review_body": "The Circle device for filtering websites and managing WiFi usage is ... AWESOME!  It was harder to find a device like this than I thought it should be and the reviews from others about filtering built into common brand routers.  If you've ever used OpenDNS or something similar to monitor your home's web traffic, you quickly realize it is extremely complicated and mind boggling how many different sites are communicating over your connection.  (Yes, you are being monitored by all kinds of sites you don't realize.)  I am reasonably adept at these kind of things, and I didn't want to invest an incredible amount of time trying to make most of the options out there work.\n\nCircle offered the unique ability to have an easy-to-configure filtering device without having to replace your router.  I use my Apple AirPort Extreme base with Circle and it was not a problem to set up -- plus you don't have to put any software on each device you are trying to control.  We have seven profiles set up on Circle so we can carefully customize our use rules.  My wife and I have our own profile with virtually no filtering or controls on them at all.  We have one computer set-up by itself which is set for the kids but allows them to use YouTube ... it's just in a public room where we can see what they are watching.  And on it goes.  I can say that I did setup a separate profile for my iPhone ... I once disabled WiFi for my profile then realized I essentially locked myself out of the system because my iPhone could no longer connect.  I used my wife's phone -- she has the app too with complete control -- to turn my profile back on.\n\nAlso it has been a relief that we don't have to nag the kids as much to get off electronics at night.  I tell them \"the wifi goes off at 8:30pm\" and it does -- they don't fuss about it as much as before.  Sure sometimes they ask to get back on, but psychologically that is very different for them then just holding onto an iPad for dear life trying to suck another minute out of a game.  For whatever reason, they accept that its time to be done much easier because their devices simply no longer work.\n\nOne last comment ... they have lots of options built in regarding specific apps or websites.  These usually work but don't always.  You'll learn to tweak things over time and especially at the beginning you should test things.  Circle does allow you to put in custom entries for websites to allow or disallow.  For example, our kids use Google Chrome extensively at their school and we were having problems with drive.google.com getting filtered.  Once I put that into the allowed list, it hasn't been an issue.",

The schedules are simple - as others have pointed out, a bit more flexibility would be nice.\nIt works.  No software to install to the devices.  It uses the devices MAC address to block internet.\nA few gripes I have:\n-The iPhone software has a few bugs.  My device list shows devices under the wrong name, but if I drill into it, I can see the right assignment.\n-Schedules are simple.  This is good and bad.  It's Thanksgiving week so would be nice to have a way for me to give them holiday hours.\n-I had issues installing the device and had to factory reset it.  I contacted Circle support - they helped me out right away.  I suggest updating the web site with links to the YouTube videos they already have.\n-When my kids eventually get cell service, I would like to have some safe guards in place.  I think the $10 a month is kind of high.  Maybe $5 a month?\n-I put myself in Adult mode.  I got blocked from accessing a web site!  I had to make myself un-managed to access the site.  Why would adults ever get blocked?\n\nSuper wish list:\n-It only blocks internet.  It doesn't block the device.  This is actually something Apple or Android will probably need to address.  My kids learned quickly which apps need internet.  Unless I do a room sweep before they go to bed, they can sneak on their devices and use them.\n-Better network discovery.  (To be fair, my wifi router doesn't do the best job either)",

                "review_body": "To begin, my wife and I share an Amazon account in her name.  So, I am doing the review under her. We bought the Disney Circle for my kid\u2019s devices.  We were getting tired of them searching the internet every night before bed.  We\u2019ve tried to take it away from them but not without gnashing of teeth.  We've had it for less than a week and so far it's done what's advertised. However, before too much praise it does have its faults.\n\nStarting with the Praise:\nTHE APP IS NOW AVAILABLE FOR ANDROID-- Big Plus for us since the only Apple devices we have are our T.V. and my wife\u2019s computer, otherwise we would\u2019ve gone with a different product.\nINITIAL SET UP IS VERY SIMPLE-- It comes in a small approx. 4\u201dX4\u201d box.  Upon opening it are the Circle, charger, and an Ethernet cable.  You download the Circle Disney App and follow instructions.\nTHE DESIGN IS SIMPLE AND UNOBTRUSIVE\u2014You can place it anywhere without it being very noticeable.\nTHE APP IS USER FRIENDLY WITH PLENTY OF OPTIONS\u2014You can control the amount of internet time per kid including how long they are on a particular site.  Pause or shutdown the internet per device.  Add parental controls on the router and see the kids search history.\n\nNow for the faults:\nINITIAL SET UP IS SIMPLE BUT SETTING UP THE PROFILES REQUIRES A LITTLE MORE EXPLORING \u2014The App lets you know if it\u2019s an Android or Apple device but its real identification is the MAC address. This is not a big deal and it\u2019s not overly difficult to figure out, just wish it was a little clearer in the instructions.\nWORKS BEST FOR TABLETS AND T.V.\u2019S NOT PHONES\u2014My biggest issue is the fact that most of my kids devices are cell phones.  The problem is kids can easily figure out that they can by-pass the controls by simply turning off the WI-FI on their settings and use the phones 4G.  Now we can easily rack up additional phone CHARGES.  Not really an issue that Circle with Disney can change, however, I wish I had some forethought into the matter before I considered buying the product.  At least, we are able to cut down the T.V. and tablet time.\nOverall this is a great product. I think most parents would be very pleased to have The Circle with Disney in their home.",

                "review_body": "This product is misrepresented by its description. It DOES NOT allow you to limit your kid's screen time. It only allows you to disable/filter internet access.\n\nIn terms of monitoring/tracking, it only tracks and limits the time your kid's spend on games that require internet access. It does not limit any apps that do not require internet access or apps that can be played in offline mode.  Worst of all, for online apps, when the restrictions take effect no message or warning appears to indicate why the app has ceased to function--the apps simply stop working and error messages begin to appear--which prompts complaints about non-functioning apps.\n\nBased on the description online and descriptions from friends that have this device, I was led to believe it was capable of fully disabling the devices when the time limit had been reached--this is not true. It does not limit screen time, just internet access.\n\nIf your kids exclusively play online games then this device might work for you, but otherwise, you will be disappointed. In terms of limiting internet access, the restriction settings built into iOS can provide many of the same limitations.\n\nUPDATE: After about a month of the limited functionality described above, it disconnected from my router and refuses to reconnect. Now it is a $100 doorstop.\n\nUPDATE:  The router issues seem to have resolved themselves and after a few weeks or rebooting the device.  Also, after a month of use Circle it became apparent that even though the device doesn't control screen time, screen time is a valuable commodity to my kids--more valuable to them than an allowance.  In the past few weeks, using the integration with Mothership and ChoreMonster I now have an effective token economy whereby my kids do chores to earn points that can be redeemed for time online and/or app purchases.  In the past week, my kids eagerly anticipate the running of the dishwasher, and eagerly do other chores, so they can obtain points in ChoreMonster to redeem.\n\nThe integration between Circle and Mothership is a bit cumbersome to setup--it would be great if it were a single app--you will find yourself constantly flipping between the two apps to keep your economy running.  Also, the integration is a bit buggy but works well enough to provide a rudimentary token economy.  Hopefully, they will get the bugs worked out with future releases.",

                "review_body": "I can't say enough good about this simple device. It has worked very well for us with our limited bandwidth internet plan. I've read a few reviews of people who haven't been able to make it work for them, and that is really unfortunate. Spouse and I are both technologically challenged, but this was very easy to set up and maintain.\n\nIt has made life so much easier and much peace of mind in allowing our kids the freedom within boundaries that was so hard to give, before we met Circle!\n\nThat little pause button is the answer for many parents who have been pulling hair out for years.\n\nAnd we really like the fact that we can put our kids friends devices on time limits when visiting here for sleepovers.\n\nThe only cons we have are the following:\n\nIf your kid is smart enough and desperate enough, and you are away from home, they can unplug and take the Circle box and walk with it away from your house. This will make it lose the signal of course. My teen did this when we were out of town once, and took the box over to a neighbour's home and hid it on their doorstep at night. Then came back home and had free rein for the rest of the weekend. I did receive a notification on my phone, but of course couldn't do anything about it at the time.\n\nIf your kids don't know what the box is for, or if you are able to hide it, this might not happen. But our kids were highly suspicious as soon as they discovered that little white box behind the computer. So of course everything has to be explained then, and chaos breaks out. (Just wish we could've had the Circle when the kids were younger so they would have grown up with it.)\n\nThe other problem I'm having is the notification when the Circle is off line. We frequently have power outages in the farm area, and my iPhone will not always  give me notifications if I lose my wifi signal. I don't always have data on my phone, so this can be a huge problem. I really would like to see a text message or even an email from Circle when it goes off line. Please?!\n\nDefinitely would like to see different time allotments for specific days of the week--or at least a separate weekend mode and a weekday mode.\n\nThis is not a replacement device for good parenting!!!! It is a tool to help good kids have freedom within the boundaries you have set for them.\n\nAt no other time in history has there been such a tantalizing, addictive, direct channel that has pervaded almost every home in North America. Up until Circle arrived in my home, there was really no easy solution to filtering and controlling this subtle addiction that afflicts our kids.\n\nThank you to the producers of this wonderful device. So glad we met Circle!!!",

                "review_body": "For Christmas I bought my 12 year-old son an XBoxOne. When he asked me to assign an email address to it and connect it to our wifi I was immediately concerned and combed through the settings very carefully and turned on all the available parental controls. Satisfied that I had protected him I was about to walk away when I did one last check on the system. That's when I found an internet web browser with full, unfiltered access to the internet essentially buried in the software.\n\nThat's when it became clear that I can't keep track of all the individual \"smart\" devices that keep getting added to my network. I needed a global solution.\n\nThat's when I bought Circle.\n\nThis was a super-easy install in my home. I like the app that goes with it because I can customize the filters in my home. However, the premise that you can assign a filter to an individual person is a little misleading because all you can really do is assign a filter to a device. That means that while your child's XBoxOne may be filtered appropriately--if the child uses your computer with a less restrictive filter assigned to it--then they're not as safe from inappropriate material as you might think.\n\nAlso, there is a setting in the app that is supposed to make Google Safe Search (image search) the default for all devices that are assigned to it. Unfortunately, most of the time that function doesn't seem to work for an image search--meaning that an innocent search could produce pornographic results. Perhaps that's something that Circle will improve in the future.\n\nUpon testing I've also found inconsistencies in filtering, i.e., zero filtering sometimes. Again, this may be due to the newness of the product and will be fixed in automatic updates. .\n\nSo why give 4 stars if I've seen some problems? Because it's much easier to use than anything else I've ever tried and customizing things with the app is very easy to do. Also, I can clearly see every single device that is connected to my network (both wireless and wired). If a device gets added to my wifi network it will automatically get filtered without me doing anything at all to it. The different filtering levels are also very easy to set.\n\nI haven't tried the scheduling or time functions on it because I don't really need those functions.",

                "review_body": "This is a very interesting and useful product if you have kids using the Internet. Essentially it is an Internet filter: you can filter content and disable Internet access at certain times. It is not an all-or-nothing approach: there are controls over specific applications or types of applications. However, there are some limitations:\n1. Overall time limit: You need to decide a total number of hours of Internet usage. You can then specify individual limits for certain apps but there's no current way to allow an app like iMessage or Spotify to not be subject to Internet limits. So a kid could be doing their homework while streaming Spotify and use up their entire Internet allocation if it is set to a low value. And in the case of iMessage, \"blue bubble\" people are unavailable when you're out of Internet allowance. The workaround is to set iMessage to fall back to SMS, but this isn't great and also only works on an iPhone and not an iPod touch or iPad. I'm told that this is being addressed, but right now it is probably the biggest limitation for me.\n2. Filter levels: As far as I can tell, the Kid filter level provides no ability to use WhatsApp. This doesn't make sense since iMessage and Facetime are allowed. My workaround was to set the filter level to Teen and turn off the things I didn't want (Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook, etc.)\n3. False identification: In the Insights screen, you can see that Circle tries to categorize where time is being spent. Unfortunately, due to the way the Internet works, things can get miscategorized. In the screenshot, akamaiedge.net and cloudfront.net more than likely are media being delivered since they are CDNs, so should probably be under the Video category.\n\nYou'll probably want to have many devices like routers, printers, etc. unmanaged and Circle lets you do this. You can also setup default behavior for new devices that join the network. I've created a \"house default\" as well as \"Visiting Kid\" profile so that visiting kids with their devices are locked down the same way that my kids are, and visiting adults are not. The nice thing is that because Circle works at the network level, there is no client software to be installed: it just works, which is exactly what you want.\n\nCircle Go is an optional paid service. In my mind, it really isn't optional because, without it, a device is unmanaged outside of the home WiFi network. It works by installing a device management profile on the device and pushes all Internet traffic through a VPN.",

                "review_body": "This has been hands-down the absolute best fit for my needs, at a nice low price and low install effort.  I wanted to be able to control access for each of my kids separately and for *every one* of their devices.  Until the Circle, I couldn't find any solution that reliably blocked certain sites and services from mobile devices (e.g. the YouTube app).  I almost resorted to building out my own proxy solution with open source products or even another paid networking software I found, but then a friend mentioned the Circle.  The install was drop dead simple, except for one complication.  I have dozens of devices on my network, and during setup they didn't all come up named something recognizable.  I eventually had to track down the MAC addresses of each device to figure it out - in fact, I later found online recommendations from Circle to this effect - documentation on this should have been included in the box, as it's possibly the only stumbling block for standard/non-techonologist users.\n\nNow for the one star I trimmed off.  We started having problems accessing one particular website that my kids use for school work on a daily basis.  The site wouldn't even resolve to an IP.  I tried a few things with my router and cable modem, but eventually gave up and had them using a hotspot for a while.  Then, our entire internet access started behaving the same - no names would resolve, like DNS was busted.  I bought a new router, swapped out my cable modem, and prayed to the gods of the internet, to no avail.  I eventually thought to reboot the Circle... lo and behold, problem solved... temporarily.  I had the same problem crop up again several times across several weeks.  It all eventually stabilized, and I have no idea why.  Now I'm paranoid that any blip at all in my internet access is the darn Circle acting up again.  But, if it does really start acting up, I'll try rebooting the Circle as my first action.  Note, rebooting the Circle can't be done on the device, as it has sneaky battery backup, but rather has to be done through the app.\n\nThe Circle doesn't provide terribly comprehensive or accessible logs, so if you're looking at this as a way to track your kids' internet usage to a detailed level, rather than mostly just keeping them away from certain things or limiting their time online, then this may not be for you.\n\nAll in all, I definitely recommend this for any parents wanting to put some easy-to-install yet powerful controls in place.",

                "review_body": "This has REALLY Helped me manage our network and four kids screen time. We have it filtering four laptops, iPhone, Samsung galaxy phone, Roku, wii, blue ray player, Panasonic tv, three iPads, two kindles, Samsung tablet and a desktop. I don't have to chase kids down ensuring they have turned in their electronics, circle automatically shuts things down when they have reached their limit (only one of my kids ever hits his) or when bedtime is reached. I can see what each person is spending time doing when they are \"on\" and I can ever filter by a particular website - like shutting down World of Tanks after he kept playing it for three hours each day.\n\nI love being able to pause whoever's access needs to be paused so they will come and finish chores if they haven't been done, then unpause when they finish it. I set up a bedtime and morning time for he tv too. That means my kids don't wake up early on the weekends just to watch Netflix.\n\nCircle is in addition to every parental control that is available for each unique product. For instance my kids kindles are only on Free Time. The iPads have parental controls and each computer has user names set up on it for the different children (they vary in age). I was never happy with all of these controls because each one is unique and each one had to be learned and kept up with by me - big pain. And they still didn't prevent certain kids from overriding You Tube controls (which suck because they aren't password protected). Circle has been the answer for all of those problems.\n\nHaving shared how awesome it is, here is what needs improvement. First, one computer we have is shared by two users and it would be nice if circle would recognize them separately. Secondly, I wish kids could ask for access to a certain website that has been automatically blocked. This was a feature in the old windows parental controls and I really liked it. As they get older and have to study wars, etc they need access to certain websites that I would allow if I could easily pick and choose. I also wish there was a way to view \"forgotten devices\" that I at first left off monitoring.  And the last issue I have is with the history.  It's VERY detailed as in minute by minute detailed. I wish there was a way to search by a time or website instead of scrolling through every single minute of useage.\n\nAll and all this is a great product and I'm really thankful someone created it. It has helped me manage our digital life.",

                "review_body": "This review is not only of the Circle base unit, but of the associated Circle Go service (MyCircle app).  The 3-star rating reflects the combination of those two services, as the presence of the Circle Go service was the compelling reason that I bought it.\n\nCircle base unit: the unit is easy to set up, easy to pair with your wireless router, and easy to adjust settings for.  It literally takes a couple of minutes, and you're good-to-go.  I was a little concerned it wouldn't work with my Samsung Connect Home system (mesh wifi with various \"nodes\" throughout the house).  It connected without any issue.  The app is very easy to use, navigate, and adjust.  I absolutely love that you can block various apps specifically, such as Snapchat, which I don't want any of my children having access to.  Being able to pause internet and enforce off-screen times is fantastic.  5-stars across the board for the app and base unit's functionality.\n\nCircle Go (MyCircle app):  this is one of the main reasons I bought the system.  I want something that covers not only all devices on our home wifi, but also one that covers my kids' cell phone and Kindles away from the home on other people's wifi, or on data.  The fact that this app actually DOES work on Kindle Fires is a HUGE plus.  Most internet filter and parental control software systems such as Norton do NOT work on Kindle Fires due to the extreme lockdown that Amazon has on the backend of the Android OS they use.  MyCircle DOES install beautifully on Kindle and allows the same level of functionality that exists for Android and iOS.\n\nHOWEVER, despite the glowing performance and many reviews by companies online, the massive downside of MyCircle is that is causes huge issues with connectivity by those devices on MyCircle due to the VPN connection required.  Sometimes it works just fine with no perceived slowdown of internet speeds, but at other times it completely locks the system down to the point that a soft reboot is the only way to restore internet connectivity.  I went through every single troubleshooting method listed on the Circle website and none yielded anything other than short-term results.  Give it a day or so and they just resurface.  I can't describe how frustrating this is, because for once, I found a system that promised all of the functionality, coverage, parental control, and flexibility that I wanted for our devices both in the home and away from the home.  Unfortunately, until the MyCircle app's downfalls are dealt with, this unit offers very little additional services that free OpenDNS doesn't also provide.\n\nIf the MyCircle app ever fixes the connectivity problems that plague it so much right now, I'll easily re-consider.  Due to Amazon's 30-day return policy however, I have no choice but to return it unless I want to never be able to recoup the $40 I spent.  Such a promising system with such a poor roll-out of the mobile features...",

                "review_body": "Wev'e had Circle with Disney for a little over a week now and I absolutely love it. We have an early teen and a preteen in our house. The early teen was accessing a lot of inappropriate stuff on the internet through various devices (phones, iPad, Xbox, Smart TV features). Circle has allowed us to have much tighter control over his access. Obviously we still have to monitor things with him but I have much more confidence that we are blocking stuff than I did before. I love the time limits! Before we would say \"one hour\" but it was up to us to keep track. It usually ended up being more because we would get involved in our own tasks around the house, etc. Now I don't even have to think about it and the kids come to me when their time is up, asking to do chores in order to earn more time. My 11 year old swept the garage, cleaned out her closet and brushed down the pool last weekend - that's more housework than she's ever done! She has also learned the hard way about monitoring her usage - she used up her entire You Tube time one day before watching her favorite show. Now she has learned to pay attention to her time limits and make better choices. But what I love best is the Home setting, where I can determine the rules around Wifi use in our house when friends come over. No more watching Netflix on a friend's iPad late into the night during sleepovers. The downsides are what others have mentioned: no control over cellular data, no weekday/weekend settings, no differentiation between school work and fun. I understand there is a cellular data app coming out soon but what I did in the meantime was set restrictions on their phones and force all apps other than phone calls and texting onto WiFi only. I really agree that there needs to be a password on the app on the phones - far too easy for a kid to access. But so far we are beyond pleased with what Circle does and I recommend it highly.\n\nETA: Circle with Disney has made a few additions and modifications to the product, as well as released their data monitoring app, Circle Go. The new modifications are a passcode on the app itself and the ability to set different time limits for weekday vs. weekend. Thanks for listening, Circle, these are great! We did subscribe to Circle Go for our kids' cell phones and so far are very pleased with it. My son was away at a camp this summer where he was allowed to have his phone and I could monitor his usage while he was there. In fact, it was often the only time he would reach out to us, to ask for his bedtime to be extended or more time for his time limits! I could use those texts as a way to also say \"hi\" and chat with him a little. So without Circle Go I would have probably heard from him a lot less. I also had to contact customer support for some help with our Circle going down and they were beyond helpful and responsive. I was very, very pleased with the level of care and attention I received. Plus we were able to fix the problem and get things up and running quickly.",

                "review_body": "I've had this for about a year - I can't say enough great things about this device, it does everything you can imagine and more.\n\nNow before I begin - I will say that I am technically inclined, well actually it what's I get paid 9-5 to do - so more than just inclined. At first I wanted someway to monitor and filter what was received on their phone. I tried numerous apps, from free to paid. I found a few apps that worked for awhile, and after a few google searches - they found a way to uninstall them. The other apps, which I even paid a subscription fee for - they got around by simply factory resetting their device.  Even tried to filter via DNS via OPENDNS.com and this wasn't always 100%.\n\nNow with this Circle with Disney device I don't have install anything on their device. I can monitor multiple devices from their PS4, phone, tablet, school laptop - everything. Say I want everything to cut off at 8:30 so they can get ready for bed - I can put in a bedtime. No problem, no arguing, no fuss. They get used to it - and it becomes routine to the point they make sure to not start a Fortnite game beforehand.\n\nI can have his ROKU and his PS4 in different 'circles', if I only want him to play online for only 2-3 hours - but may want to give him more time watching cartoons in the morning.\n\nI can even give rewards - say I want to extend his 'cut off bedtime' - just go to rewards and extend by 15 minutes or whatever you want.\n\nThe app always notifies if another device connects to my network - so no surprises if a friend brings a phone or he brings a different school laptop with that has a different MAC than what he originally had. Just move the device to the 'filtered circle or circles.'\n\nYou can also pause the circles or even pause the entire internet that isn't even in the circles.\nWife talking back? Pause her internet. Just kidding but you absolutely could from the app.\nSpeaking of the Mrs, she can have her own login - and control the kids devices also, from pausing, rewards.\n\nBut once you have a schedule in place - most of it, is set it and forget it.\n\nHe hasn't figured out how I'm able to monitor and pause his internet - but if it is ever disconnected from the router it will send me a notification.  I only know this because I get a notification when I'm rearranged a few things and had to disconnect it.\n\nThe only bad things I will say is that it takes a few(5+) minutes sometimes when I try to open the app, even a year later this problem still persists. Also, if he was ever to go to a different network or a different home - then all that filtering/time limit - goes out that window. Yet, I've read you can pay a subscription for them to be filtered wherever they go. So, there's that.\n\nOnce again. Awesome device and I will be using for the future little ones....I don't see it being outdated anytime soon.",

                "review_body": "We've only had Circle for a week so here are my 1st impressions. It needs some work but there is very little out there right now that can do what Circle does. We walked into Best Buy to ask for something similar and they looked at us like we had 2 heads. 3 workers stood there and told us they had never heard of circle and there was no way they knew of to limit time on the internet at the level of the household. With 3 kids and 7 devices between them, that is just unmanageable:\n\nCons:\n1) It is not as easy to set up as they claim. We had some initial issue (explained in #2) and then once we got it up and running it really took us a few hours to get everyone set up. We do have about 12 devices in the household.\n\n2) Technically it does not work on a dual band router. However, we found a work around. If you password protect your 5G line with a different password than the 2G and don't give that password to your kids, you can monitor the 2G band via circle.  Since all of our devices do not access 5G, we had to choose to monitor the 2G.\n\n3) My 15 year old worked around the system in 3 minutes flat. We did not tell him what we were doing and then we hit the pause button on his devices (total power trip). As we sat there giggling, waiting for him to come running in to complain the internet was down, we noticed a new device pop up on the screen that mirrored his regular laptop. We believe he changed the mac address, which caused circle to see it as a unique device. New devices automatically pop into the home profile. Here was our solution: sort EVERY device into a profile other than home and then permanently leave Home on pause.\n\n4) I've noticed when they are on Youtube (for example) I cannot tell what they were watching there, just that they've been there. I have to hope the filter works there. More testing is needed on my end!\n\nPros:\n1) Control over internet time: I can pause any kid or the whole system IF I am home. I don't know what happens if I try it away from home. I can set bedtimes for each profile and per kid internet time limits. When I go to bed, I can shut down the whole house if I want.\n\n2) Control over subject matter seen: Even on the adult level filter, it filters out inappropriate websites. I can see the sites my kids are visiting (though not which device they are using if I group them under 1 kid) and presumably block specific sites that they have visited if I am concerned.",

                "review_body": "Initial Setup\nI like how (almost) easy it is to setup, it took me about 15 minutes. You plugin the power cable and optional ethernet cable. While the power cable is easy to find where it gets plugged in, the ethernet port you have to open. The box itself is quite big for something that has no screen or buttons on it (except for a hardly visible power button). -.5 stars\n\nAdding users\nIt is not really intuitive to add a user, it should have a plus sign on the page with all the users; now it has a pause button and to add a user you have to go into a menu. I'd like to see the plus button to add a user and a global pause button when I tap on the home. I am OK with one additional tap, it's more intuitive to pause everyone or an individual user while the add a user button is on that screen. -.5 stars\n\nInternet speed\nIt really slows down the internet download speed 3 times even though I have it directly connected through an ethernet cable. -2 for that\n\nTime limits and filters\nYou can control each user separately by adding devices to a user and you can easily switch which device belongs to which user at any time. This is handy if one device is shared between kids/adults. This way each user has his/her own time schedule assigned. Circle has their own preset websites, but you can add your own. You can tell circle which devices not to control (Amazon echo, Philips hue, tp-link, etc). You can only control devices on the same Wi-Fi network/SSID so if you have the same wifi router, but have multiple networks/SSIDs, circle will only let you control ONE. If all of your devices are connected to one SSID network, but your guests are connected to a guest network, the guests will have full access to internet. Keep this in mind when managing your kids' time limits, if your kids know your Wi-Fi password, they can easily switch SSID and you won't even know about it unless at the end of the day you review what websites your kids visited and you notice no logs for that day. I would like to tell Circle which SSID networks to control. -.5 for that\n\nI would like the ability to create a \"homework\" or \"work\" category and assign websites to that. That category should have a different rule for time limits (none, 1 hour, etc) which is separate from global time limit for a user. For example, my child is doing his homework for 3 hours, but has a time limit to be on the internet for 1 hour. The 3 hours of homework should not reduce the 1 hour of total time limit.\n\nPausing internet is extremely easy. Just open up the circle app, enter your pin (optional) and tap on pause button. You can also pause individual users by tapping on the user and tapping on the pause button which will pause internet for all devices that user has assigned to him/her. This is very useful for family dinners. +.5 for that\n\nLogs\nYou can see which user visited what site and how long they've been there. Each site is categorized (entertainment, shopping, etc), but I haven't found a way yet to move a site to a different category. I mean to some amazon website can be shopping while for others (such as seller) it can be work.\n\nPage shown when blocked\nWhen a user gets blocked from visiting a site, Circle shows a very friendly page with statistics for that user. +.5 for that\n\nRemote control\nUnfortunately there's no way to remotely control the Circle. When I initially set it up, it asked me to register which was very quick. But I wonder what the point of registration is if I cannot control it remotely. One can argue that this will not allow anyone else to gain control, but for that you don't need my email, you just need a pin code. I'd like to be able to reward my children with additional internet time if for example they cleaned up a room, but I can't do that unless I am on the same Wi-Fi network.\n\nAlerts via email\nI haven't received any email alerts yet. I was able to unplug the Circle from my network and visit any site I wanted. This makes sense, but what doesn't make sense is why I -- the parent -- did not get alerted that someone at my home removed the Circle and bypassed all the filters/time limits. -.5 for that.",

                "review_body": "Setup was fine, but I'm very techie.  My guess though is for most average users, they may struggle initially with setup.  Now I have this plugged into my extender so it's a direct connect vs wireless.  I've set this up to control via my ipad.  It controls my 2 daughter's ipads and one computer laptop.  So far, it's pretty basic.  It allows you to restrict by total time and by specific apps, i.e. youtube, netflix, etc.\n\nI agree with the other reviews that it would be nice to have the ability to control each setting on a daily basis so during school nights, I can have it shut off the internet connection at a different time vs the weekend.  Same with the duration of each app.  ie. school days netflix may only be able to access 1 hour, but on weekends 2 hours.\n\nIt has made it much easier to take the devices away at night time.  I have it set to shut off at 8:30 and it's only taken a couple days, and now both kids just put the ipad away and there's no argument or wining.  Hoping there will be additional enhancements such as:\n\ndifferent settings for each day\nability to add on the fly extended time for tasks being done.  ie. complete your homework, quickly input a code that allows 30 minutes extra time for xx app.\n\nOk adding some additional comments and features that would be nice.\n\n2 outstanding issues I still wish circle would have are:\n\nOverride button where I can either add time easily or gain full control over the device without having to shut each section down.  Ended up having to do this to add another control app to bridge the gap that circle doesn't have.  But in order to do this, I had to change the rating to none, disable bedtime (because I was doing this after the kids went to bed), disable restrictions, etc.  Then had to re-enable afterwards.  I orginally thought the pause button was going to allow this, but that's for another purpose.\n\nSecond feature missing is an area where I could place apps or websites that ignore the settings for example, educational apps, The kids can play on those without a time limit, but there's no way to allow them to go over the time limit setting.  In fact schools are now expecting my kids to go to certain sites to enhance their math and reading, but there's no way to white list these sites or apps to prevent circle from counting it as time against them or limiting it past bedtime rules.\n\nThe picture for each kid doesn't work, tried zooming to frame my kid and it just ignores it and includes a corner of the photo.\n\nI'm hoping Disney moves a bit quicker on getting these types of added functionality.  Other challenge is when the device is not at home, but say at a friends or relative.  That's where apps have a leg up, but I do like the ability to control both PC and tablet devices.  Right now, I'm using a combination of apps and circle to try to bridge the gap.  for example, I no longer use circle's bedtime restrictions as I have an app that does this and allows for time to be added with a push of a button, something circle does not provide.",

                "review_body": "I was skeptical at first about using this device.  So far, it has done what I expected.\n\nI have a not-so-normal network configuration.  Two routers daisy chained. I have the circle hard-wired to the second router as opposed to using the wifi.  I did this since I assumed that sending every packet to the circle over wifi would slow down my wifi (I'm guessing it would).  The setup was simple enough.\n\nI entered in the MAC of both my son's ethernet card and wireless ethernet card.  And for testing purposes, I also added my laptop to the system with an \"adult filter.\"  I think this allows access to nearly everything except explicit photos (aka: pornography).\n\nFor my son, I used the \"kid filter.\"  I found that filter was a little to strict even for an 8-year-old.  He was trying to work on a report for school and was searching information about history.  There was a fair amount of content that the circle blocked that looked innocuous to me.  Good news though, I can update the filters on the fly.  It took some guesswork but ultimately I might have found the sweet spot.\n\nThere's a few things that the circle doesn't do well enough.  To be fair, I don't know how it would do it.  If anyone here has a kid's kindle fire, you can configure it to block access after 30 minutes of games or shows.  The kid could do any combination of 30 minutes and then the kindle essentially turns off.  The circle doesn't really have that option.  Sure, I can block youtube after 30 minutes, but that doesn't stop him from simply going somewhere else to watch a video afterwards.\n\nHowever, that might simply be asking more than the device could ever do.  When you think about it, if my kid wants to look up on youtube how to play a song on his guitar (for example), I'd want there to no limit on usage.  Or really, anything that is educational or enrichment.  The Circle can't differentiate and nor should we expect it to.\n\nI will say that I did some testing on his computer by entering in some explicit words and it pretty much blocked whatever I came up with.  There's a time and place to talk to kids about sex and violence.  Blocking them off from the internet because of those reasons alone probably isn't a good idea (in my opinion).  It seems like the Circle does do that fairly well.  It gives them some protection at a younger age until I can have these sort of discussions with him.\n\nA few other notes: I can say that hard-wiring the device to my router has not impacted my internet speeds at all. I know some people have concerns about that.  I'm also a big fan of being able to update settings on the fly as necessary.  Or in a pinch, I can essentially disable all internet access or if I'm sitting there with him, I can essentially turn off all filters.\n\nIt is an impressive device for what it does.",

                "review_body": "We have had this device for about two months now. I wanted to wait to write my review until I'd given it a good chance and had time to see whether or not it was helpful for our family. In theory, this device is fabulous and exactly what I was looking for. In practice, while there are some features that are indeed helpful, there are a number of drawbacks or limitations to the device that make it almost useless for our family. First, the good. I found the device quite easy to set up, and the profiles relatively easy. The only drawback here is that it is difficult to parse and locate each of the devices in your home from their MAC addresses. You'll be surprised how many devices you have in your home that have a MAC address, so be prepared to spend some time identifying all of them. For us, this included our Amazon Echos and Dots, our printer, our router, our cell phone booster, our cable TV devices, our Roku streaming device, our phones, our computers, our iPad, our Kindle Fire, and (you get the idea...). That said, this is no fault's of Disney Circle, so that did not influence my rating of the device. Once I'd finally identified my children's devices and set up our profiles, we were up and running. I did notice a slowdown of our device and our network. We already have terrible network coverage where we live, so I figured we'd see a downgrade in performance. It's noticeable, but not enough to prohibit our use of the Circle. I love that the device shows me the usage for each profile we've set up, and breaks it down into categories and specific apps. I love that I can choose a generic filter, such as \"teen,\" but then also filter out specific websites and apps that we don't allow. I love that I can track which websites have been visited. BUT...\n\nHere's what I don't love or that I find really frustrating. Kids can easily get around the Circle bedtime if they want to pop online and check something by quickly turning off wifi and using their cell network, then turning wifi back on when done. In the History section, throughout the night, Circle will list and track numerous sites and apps that have been accessed. Initially, this caused quite a few arguments in our household until we realized that Circle was catching things like when apps do automatic updates during the night! I found this out by testing my own device at night. I called Circle's support and they admitted that yes, there is no way for the app (at this point) to differentiate or list out when it's just an app itself doing an update and communicating with the wifi. This almost makes the History section useless, in my opinion, because there is really no way whatsoever for me to tell if my children are accessing Snapchat at night or if it's just the app itself. Here's another very specific frustration. My children are not allowed to use Facebook. I have it set as \"not allowed\" in their profile filters. That said, every single day (and nighttime) there is a ton of Facebook time listed in the History and Usage sections. I've confirmed (through mommy superpowers--can't give away my secrets!) that my children do NOT have FB accounts, and yet FB is still being listed in the usage section. Most likely, the Circle is just picking up a connection between Instagram and FB, since the two are tied together in many ways. This seems to happen to me as well. When I am not on FB for the day, but I access Instagram, FB is listed in my history section. I find that these limitations in Circle make it almost useless for us. If I can't reliably tell what my children are and aren't using, and I have to guess if it's just an app updating or really usage by my children, how is that helpful? For now, personally, I'd recommend waiting on this Device until Disney can work out some of these limitations.",

                "review_body": "It's a start, but it's not perfect.  We got this because we were handing over my old iPhone 6 (wifi only, no cellular/data service) to my 7 year old and wanted control over what she could access and for how long.  We are using Circle and the iPhone's own parental controls together, so I cannot evaluate Circle on it's own.\n\nHere's what I like about it:\n- It can grow with us as a family and allow us to gradually give access to things like social media yet while in \"kid\" mode these are all automatically blocked.\n- I can block specific websites, both proactively and if need be retroactively if she's found/stumbled on something that snuck through the other controls but I deem inappropriately for any reason.\n- I can block some particular apps/\"platforms\" which I find inappropriate for her age (e.g. Musical.ly, YouTube, etc.)\n- I can set time limits for overall online use and for specific types of applications and it sends alerts to both her phone and ours when she is nearing those limits.\n- Easy to block ads that pop up during apps/games.\n- Facilitates limit setting and clear boundaries.\n\nWhat I wish was different:\n- Although it sends a \"history\" of all websites visited that day, this does not at all reflect what she actually did.  Many of these were autovisited by the phone (had no idea it did this) when she was nowhere near it.  For example, it may go to apple.com a million times a day for no apparent reason and this not only shows up in her history but it also counts against her total time spent online for the day (mostly falling under \"Science & Technology\" as you'll see just about everything else does as well), averaging about 5-10 minutes per day of calculated online time that she didn't actually do.  But it also lists websites that are clearly somehow associated with the apps she is  using (ad agencies, etc.) yet I know that she never actually clicked on anything or went to the web explicitly.  This makes this feature (for us, at this stage in her internet use at least) more frustrating than helpful.\n- Not all the apps she uses actually stream online content (vs. load locally then disconnect) and therefore the time spent on them doesn't seem to factor into how much time she's been online.  So it doesn't so much regulate the amount of total tech time as it does time spent online.  While I understand this, since it's connected to the wifi router directly, you'd think that since there was also a locally installed app that you'd be able to somehow manage the screen/app directly through the apps and not just through the router.  This has the potential to create unnecessary battles (e.g. \"you've had enough time on your phone for today.\" child: NO, it still says I have X minutes left.\").\n- Unless the app you're interested in is listed by Circle as a separate \"platform\" you can't set limits on particular apps, but rather on the classification that Circle has assigned to the type of app.  This is also frustrating as it seems all of my daughter's allowed apps fall into the \"Science and Technology\" category, even though some (e.g. Crossy Road) are clearly more \"game\" while others (e.g. \"First Grade Friendzy\") are much more educational. But I have to set one limit that applies to all of them together, because this is how Circle has categorized them.\n\nSo in the end, I'm glad I bought it, but I'm also glad that I played with it for a week or so before I gave it to her so that I had a better understanding of it's limitations and glitches.  Circle gives a little more peace of mind that she's protected, as well as helps put her in control of limiting her own usage (she's very good about putting it away when it says her time on Science & Technology is up - once we taught her what this means).  But in the end, it does not replace good parenting and oversight and she's still on the device more than I want her to be because some of her apps just aren't getting counted (she hasn't figured this out yet, so it hasn't become something she's exploiting).  It would be great if the Circle device and the MyCircle app would somehow supplement each other for greater controls of overall SCREEN time and not just online time, and it would be great if it was able to list out time spent on each app, and not just provide a list of random websites the phone somehow accessed in the background.  But it's a start ...",

                "review_body": "Ok. I need to offer some words here as there appear to be many misconceptions about what Circle is. It IS an Internet traffic monitor. It will NOT monitor your kids game useage on their devices UNLESS those games are online. Even connected games may not show the true time spent playing them, rather only the time they are actually communicating.\n\nLet me further simplify: Imagine getting a call from your mother. You answer the phone and, after a polite hello and exchange of pleasantries, you listen to her talk about all the things going on on her world, like the problems with your father, Mr Barky Von Schnauzer her dog and even your kinda weird uncle Harold. You talked for 5 minutes and she talked for 60.  Circle would recognize this as 65 minutes because you're online.\n\nNow, make the same phone call and, after hellos and pleasantries, your Mom decides to walk across the street to talk with you in your kitchen instead of on the phone.  Circle would see this as 5 minutes online because Mom 1.0 decided to load locally along with all her dialog. The only thing seen on the wire was the intro.\n\nThis device is an aide to parenting. That is all. With YouTube fast becoming the modern replacement for cable TV, these tools help. And for a one time fee of $99, you can find out if your child downloaded a video instead of doing homework after school by looking at the URLs of the sites accessed along with the time connected.\n\nMy 14 year old figured out quickly he didn't like Circle and found ways to download videos to watch offline. Yup, that reduces the time spent online, but guess what? I can see where he went online at any time of the day, or night. A quick check just showed me he's spent 50 minutes on Google.com today. Yeah, unless he's researching a cure for a rare disease, he's been streaming video from Google. He has a pool of hours to use daily and that's it. We've also limited the amount of cellular data he can use per month so he is pretty limited on options.\n\nI actively use Circle and update it with web sites my son requests after I've had a chance to check them out. I love the notifications I get when he uses his allotted time and even when circle goes offline (it was a power outage, not some nefarious act!). I use profiles for everyone and \"household devices\" such as the DVR are put in the \"unmanaged\" category as anyone can use them. Unknown or new devices, such as guests are added to the \"home\" profile and are set up for \"teenager\" profile by default. This way anyone who we connect to our password protected network can use it, but not abuse it. No, your child won't be able to easily trick Circle into thinking they are someone else unless they can \"spoof\" or fake the hardware address burned into their wireless device. Can be done, but if they can do it, I'm smelling a scholarship to college coming.\n\nBedtime can be set so your home network stops responding to requests from whatever devices you want at whatever time you chose, but that DOESN'T mean that video little Johnny downloaded earlier can't be watched. If it's loaded locally he'll still have it. My suggestion? Shop Amazon for a big multi-port charger, put it in your bedroom and force your kids to plug in their devices at a certain time each night. Out of their hands is the ONLY way to keep them from using these techno-trinkets.\n\nAlso, I've recently noticed my dual band wireless network (2.4GHz and 5GHz) was not working properly with Circle. Apparently that was an issue with Circle not being able to follow the traffic across my router from the 5GHz side (my Circle is only 2.4GHz) so I had to isolate all connections to the slower 2.4GHz band. Small price to pay and that band is still faster then my 100Mbps internet connection.\n\nOverall, I love this little bugger! It's my kids best friend, even though he may not think so right now!",

                "review_body": "In our family we have three kids, ages 8 and twins that are 11 years old. Naturally they also have friends coming over all the time, many of the bringing their \"devices\" so they can all play Minecraft, Clash of Clanes etc. After using Open DNS (free) it has become clear we needed something with a better UI, preferably with an iPhone app that can remotely control the internet experience. I settled on \"Circle\" and it has now been installed for 2 weeks. Here's the good and bad:\n\n1. INSTALLATION: As some fellow reviewers pointed out there is no traditional user manual in the package, which makes total sense since the manufacturer does not want to print a \"dated\" card for a product that by its design will evolve and constantly add new features. So, instead of looking at a printed card you only need to download the free App and follow the easy set-up instructions. Basically it took 15 minutes to set up and add all the devices in the house (couldn't believe we had that many devices...). However, this is just the beginning....\n\n2. CONFIGURATION: Each device must be added to either a \"Personal Profile\", \"Home\" or \"Unmanaged Devices\" (see screenshot). This is quite logical and very much follows the concepts used on any Mac OS X or Windows computer. On each profile you can then be set with the appropriate Filter setting, along with a start time and end day daily.  As many reviewers have pointed out it seems very strange that the Developer have not added unique start and end times for weekends, this as iOS completely supports this functionality. Also the absence of \"home work time\" versus \"play time\" is missing. However, I am quite confident these two settings will be added over time as the App development work proceeds. They are the two only truly annoying features.\n\n3. SETTING UP EXCEPTIONS:  This is the most tedious part of having a truly well functioning Circle experience. I would strongly recommend to make the initial set up on a day when everyone will be home for the full day. After installing Circle and adding their device to their profile, sit down with each child and ask them to go to every website, open every game and do anything/everything they want to do on their device. This way you can easily sit next to them and create the \"exceptions\" they need to the standard filter system. Simply open the highly useful \"custom filter\" option and add the main URL as approved and they are set. This needs to be done for each \"Profile\". Plan on spending the better part of a day adding tons of these \"custom filter\" exceptions and the kids will embrace the Circle instead of having a bad week receiving calls to work where the child is upset\nbecause the are \"blocked\" on a harmless site. There is no way around this as unfortunately internet URL's never was set up with \"PG 13\" or \"R\" ratings etc.\n\n4. UNMANAGED DEVICES & HOME PROFILE: In our family we have set my wife's and mine cell phone and Tablets to be \"unmanaged devices\", which means there is no block or limitations. The computers in the house are on the \"Home\" profiles as multiple users log on to them and there is no technical way to tell who is on the computer even if they open their own profile on the iMac for example (not Circle's fault, just technical limitations).\n\n5. PAUSE BUTTON: This is the \"secret sauce\" in this product!!! With the \"pause\" button you can easily pause the internet for either all managed devices OR for an individual profile (all devices attached to this profile will pause). With this powerful tool in my hand (iPhone with App) I simply need to say \"dinner in 2 minutes, internet is going off when the clock hits 6:15 (for example). Prior to having Circle this was a simple threat that was not heard with multiple follow-up threats happening. Now everyone immediately \"saves\" and logs out of their activity as they know that the internet will indeed be shut off... The Kids all despise this new level of control but as Parents we smile as we are finally in charge again! Press \"paus\" a second time and internet is back on.\n\nSUMMARY - NEGATIVE POINTS: The App lacks 7-day individual scheduling of times and the ability to do multiple blocks of time during each day.\n\nSUMMARY - POSITIVE POINTS:\nOverall this is a tool that every Parent should have and I have been wanting for years. If nothing else it gives us control of what is being watched, when and by whom. It also serves as a great way to the kids away from \"Tablet trance\". I told the kids this will stay \"on\" as long as I am paying for them:-)\n- The App is very simple and easy to use.\n- Pause button is a \"killer app\" by itself for Parents.\n- The Profile system is logical and nicely laid out\n- The hardware is compact, looks nice and features a terrific \"backup battery\" (kids already unplugged it twice).",

                "review_body": "I really wanted to like this and there are some really great aspects to it.  However, it did not really do what I needed, which was a way to limit \"recreational screen time\" for my kids.  I am a tech guy (25+ years) so after reading the info, etc. it sounded good but the reality was less than stellar.  It *could* get there, but it has a way to go yet.\n\nGood things:\n- Set up was pretty simple.  You attach it to your network and then connect to it like it is a WIFI hotspot to configure.  Interestingly, this just sits on your network, it does not sit between your router and your ISP connection as I had expected.\n- Mobile seemed well designed and relatively intuitive.\n- Did shut off internet access to specific devices after specified time limits and enforced time rules (no access between 10 PM and 6 AM, etc.)\n\nFunctional Problems:\n** The device is not very smart about *what* to consider \"internet time\", much less recreational time.  For example, my son ran up against his limit for listening to Apple Music streaming on his iPhone and my daughter hit her limit doing homework on the school's web site / blackboard site.\n  Suggested Fixes:\n  - Allow the user to select \"unlimited\" sites / services that do not count against limits (like music streaming services, education web sites, search engines, wikipedia, etc..\n\n** The device does not limit \"screen time\", just \"internet time\".\n  Suggested Fixes:\n  - Add apps for Mac and Windows that require the user to enter their circle ID to unlock the device and then shut off access after a certain time limit unless only approved apps (web sites) are being used (as above).  If the user has wikipedia AND pinterest up, that counts agains them.  If they are only using wikipedia, then it does not.  That kind of thing.\n\n** The device does not deal with shared devices (family computer, connected TV, etc.) very well.\n  Suggested Fixes:\n  - The mobile app should allow an individual user to unlock a shared device (my son could unlock the PC or TV) and then it counts against his time. Yes, that means 1 kid could get charged while 3 watch TV but at least it is trying.  You could send a notification to the parent when shared devices are unlocked to help them monitor it.  Its not perfect, but it is something.\n\n** Device is not smart about \"internet time\".  It seemed to believe that if I use my web browser to read something and then do something like work on a word document or other non-internet related activity, it counts that against internet time.\n  Suggested Fixes\n  - Improve the algorithm for what a \"session\" is.  Using a game that connects to game center initially and then does not use the internet after that should not count as \"internet time\" for example (but should count as recreational screen time!)\n\n** Monitoring mobile devices that are using data (LTE, etc.) instead of WIFI requires setting up a VPN on the mobile device that connects to Circle and a separate monthly subscription.\n  Suggest Fixes\n  - Make this part of the one time purchase cost.  If the circle device sitting on the home network was the actual VPN endpoint meaning that all internet flowed through the device even away from home on data, then there should be very little cost involved for Circle beyond keeping a cloud based registry of circle device that people could connect to remotely.  If Circle must be the end point there would be more costs associated with the traffic, but I still think that could be built into the one time cost.  For example, Amazon has kindles with data access that they don't charge a subscription for.  Be like Amazon.\n\nBugs:\n- It did, at one point, shutdown my whole internet for no reason and I had to power cycle the device to get service back.  This happened once in the two weeks that we used it.\n\nSo... there you have it.  Basically, its a good start and for some households it may work well.  However, if you are looking to limit \"recreational screen time\" it does not do that and can't really configured to do that.  It also needs to get smarter in several ways before it becomes a truly useful tool in a real world family house hold.",

                "review_body": "Tl;dr -  this product is AMAZING and the best technology product I have purchased in a year.  It does something that is important to me that I've struggled to find an effective solution for years.\n\nPros:\n- Sufficiently powerful\n- Does not create a performance impact if properly configured\n- Easy to monitor remotely\n- Works across multiple devices\n- Provides both insight on technology use and control\n- Allows you to set service level restrictions (e.g. limit Fortnite to 1 hour/day)\n- Great price point.\n\nCons:\n- It can cause your network to break in ways that are not obvious\n- A bit complex to set up\n- The service groupings (e.g. \u201cEmail\u201d or \u201cOnline Gaming\u201d) are not customizable\n- Mobile only administration\n\nOverall a solid product and well worth the cost.\n\nDetailed Review -\n\nA bit of background - I'm technically adept and understand my way around my own network.  As my kids have become teenagers, my struggle has been to effectively parent their online behavior.  On the one hand, their devices and technology are an important part of their school, social lives, and even part of our family connectedness.  On the other, I've been concerned about how much time my son spends on Fortnite and Youtube, and about my daughter's technology use late at night.\n\nOur solutions to this have largely been ineffective.  We\u2019ve tried having the kids leave their phones downstairs when they go to bed, but that doesn't address what they do during the day, and it has been a source of conflict.  I've tried controls using my router, but they haven't been time based, nor sufficiently granular - e.g. I couldn't easily stop face time on my daughter's computer without affecting her ability to do homework.  iOS 12's Screen Time feature has been helpful, but that only provides data for a single device and it is somewhat unreliable.\n\nThe big problem is that we can\u2019t easily know exactly what they are doing without policing them, let alone come up with effective constraints.\n\nI finally found a review online for the Circle.  It seemed good, but I was concerned that 1) it might not work with my router (I use an ASUS AC5300), that it would create performance issues, and that it would not provide sufficient control to deal with the issues that we care about. However, I figured I would give it a try.\nThe key to how this product works is that it uses some obscure aspects of how networks work to give the circle the ability to see the network traffic that goes into and out of your house for any device or collection of devices (the technical term here is ARP Spoofing).  Without getting into the technical details, if you connect the Circle via the ethernet cable, it does not create a performance issue. Moreover, any device configured as \u201cunmanaged\u201d is left alone. This is something I was particularly happy about as my home network has a lot of devices on it and I like the control.\n\nInstallation:\nInstallation was a bit obtuse.  Despite being connected via ethernet to my router, I still had to use the WiFi network to setup the circle.  Moreover, the Circle only understands how to talk to 2.4Ghz networks.  That said, once everything was done, the wireless network was not an issue.\n\nSetup:\nOnce setup I created a test profile for myself to see how well the device worked.  I was pretty amazed at how easy and powerful it is.  Profiles allow you to connect multiple devices, define specific constraints on a service level (e.g. Youtube), and these constraints work across all of the devices on the profile.  Moreover, everything else is left alone.\n\nOnce active, I immediately got what I was looking for:\n- Time spent on a variety of different services (YouTube, Fortnite, Gmail)\n- Identification and monitoring explicit content sites\n- Ability to set constraints, as either hours (bedtime and blocked time)\n- Ability to set time limits (yeah!!!!)\n\nI found the monitoring/time calculations to be pretty accurate.  The only limit is that they are limited to 5 minute granularity - which is fine for me.  Once the Circle chooses to block a service, it happens pretty immediately.  Some things like youtube take a bit before the block is noticeable, but everything else is immediate.  Restoring service is also immediate, though there can be some problems (see issues below)\n\nWhat I LOVE:\n- This device allows for granular control over services.  Meaning, you can allow for web browsing and email, while blocking video games and netflix.  You can block one device but not another.\n- You can set up profiles for your family that work across multiple devices.  No more temptation to cheat by moving consumption from one device to another\n- For my network, the device even worked on the guest network which means my kids couldn\u2019t get around it that way.  It did not seem to affect our AT&T Micro-cell traffic however\n- The device provides both monitoring and prevention.  This allows me to have conversation with my kids where we now have an objective definition of time spent.  Moreover, it allows them to see how much time they are spending so THEY can set the limits - Now I get to parent as a coach instead of as a policeman.\n- There is no noticeable impact to my network performance.  I have a 400mb/s connection to the internet and have noticed no impact to my network latency or performance from the Circle.\n- It is pretty easy to use once it is set up.\n\nIssues:\n- It\u2019s not perfect however and there are some things to be aware of:\n- I can\u2019t easily customize what Circle monitors/blocks.  Circle\u2019s pre-defined categories are pretty good, but if you want to change something it is not easy - and in some cases not possible.  I would prefer to have more flexibility than the device provides, but given the ease of use it provides in other ways I can live with this constraint.\n- Networking problems - the way the circle work can create compatibility issues with your router.  Circle has put a pretty good compatibility chart on their website you can check - strongly recommended that you do this before buying this device\n- The Circle can cause your network to break - in my case, if I make a change on my router, it can cause my entire network to freeze until I reset things using some fairly technical commands.  This may be somewhat specific to my router, but when it happens, it is not something that the layperson could easily fix.  I suspect that the routers that are marked as fully compatible (mine is not) don\u2019t have this issue, but I was unable to test this.\n- The Circle is hard to reboot - it has an internal battery which I suppose is nice for power outages - though seems unnecessary to me.  However, when something goes wrong, you can\u2019t power cycle it easily.\n- When the Circle unblocks a service, sometimes it takes a while for the service to be restored.  There are multiple reasons for this. In one case, I had to reboot the router my son\u2019s Xbox was connected to to restore service.  When I tried to reproduce this it didn\u2019t happen again, but I\u2019m suspicious that this isn\u2019t the only time I\u2019ll have this problem (for those who are technical, clearing the arp cache tends to clear these issues).\n- When the Circle blocks a service, it routes the blocked user to a web page full of Disney content.  Not the worst problem in the world, and this is the only time that \u201cDisney\u201d shows up in the product.  I\u2019m sure some VP is very proud of this.\nThere is no web console.  I would prefer not to manage this just from my phone.\n\nIn the end, this device does way more than I had hoped - esp. For the price.  It has brought me a solution to a problem I have struggled with for years.  I\u2019m a very happy user and feel that the benefits of this product fully outweigh the costs.  Moreover, I like that it is something I can use to have a better dialogue with my kids about their technology use.  It enables both \u201ctrust but verify\u201d type monitoring, as well as specific and detailed constraints.\n\nGreat job!",

                "review_body": "As an IT professional and father of five (oldest of which is now 13), I wanted to bring some balance to my children's Internet usage. I researched Circle quite a bit and even joined their beta program for the Android app. Circle has been a very helpful tool in managing my kids' time online. NO device will replace parental involvement and this device is not designed to perfectly monitor or control ALL Internet usage. However, it is a good tool for parents that want to help their children learn how to manage their use of the Internet.\n\nFirst and foremost, Circle is EXCELLENT at managing the amount of time you give your children online. My three oldest kids have a tablet as well as a PC, and they also like to use the Playstation 4 for games and Netflix. I really like the ability to assign each device to an individual child. This allows you to set an overall time limit for that child and when they use it up on their tablet they can't just switch to their PC to remain online. You can also set time limits for different categories like social media and even different platforms within that category (think Facebook, Instagram, etc). This is helpful as different kids have different interests and you can fine tune their usage a bit.\n\nSecond, performance. I haven't had ANY problems with my network slowing down with Circle attached to it. I've personally chosen to hardwire Circle to the network but I tried it on wireless first and it was flawless. I don't think most people will see any sort of speed impact from Circle.\n\nThird, setup was very easy. The app for Android is easy to use (and has come a long way from beta) and works well to manage Circle. I wish there was a way to access Circle through a web interface (even just locally on the network) but I do like the ability to manage Circle from anywhere that I am through the app. I like that they included a battery inside Circle to prevent any \"accidental outages\". The designers seemed to really put some thought into the methods kids might use to disable this thing and I like that the app warns me when my Circle is offline. I've only seen that notification when my ISP connection drops but it is nice to know that it works.\n\nPlease understand that this is not a professional router/firewall and isn't meant to be. It's a consumer level tool that ASSISTS a parent in teaching their children how to manage themselves. It won't stop your kids from seeing EVERY bad thing on the Internet but it does a good job at filtering. I do wish the history capabilities were more robust. As it is now, the history option only shows you the TLD of the site visited, not any detail beyond that. While this can work if you have a blatantly obvious URL that you don't want your kid visiting, it's not so obvious what many of the sites are. Also, Circle logs EVERY site request from a device. While that sounds very helpful this means that any time a phone or tablet checks email or checks an ad server for a game or any other request from the device it will go in the log. It's amazing when you check those logs how often these devices are phoning home to different app servers. The logging functionality of Circle could really use some help as it's not very helpful to the average parent. However, I've already said that this is a consumer level device and I didn't really expect amazing logging capabilities from it.\n\nIn conclusion I think that Circle is a GREAT tool for families, especially if you get it with the aim of teaching your children instead of controlling them. I look at it like training wheels on a bike. The training wheels aren't going to make the child into an Olympic cyclist, but they will help them to balance and learn the skills they need to ride without those training wheels in the future. I hope that doesn't sound too preachy or anything. Just my view of the product.\n\nDisclaimer - I eagerly awaited the release of Circle on Android so that I could purchase it for my family. I joined the beta program before the Android app was out and paid FULL PRICE for my Circle. I have no ties to this company and have tried to present information that I think will be useful to you as a consumer. I'm not a professional reviewer but I wanted to help others in making an informed decision about Circle.",

                "review_body": "OK. I have been using this device for sometime now. My wife and I have 7 kids and while we have pushed off giving all of them digital devices until they are older and more capable of regulating their digital time on their own, we decided to give in to them because of the features promised in this device. I have to say, it has not worked out flawlessly. It has taken a considerable amount of trial and error to get it set up. It also has its flaws that we are still getting worked out. I gave 3 stars because some features are really good. But, it has taken sometime to get them working correctly. I will try to explain the benefits and struggles in a way to help others.\n\n1. Time to set up. The amount of time to set this up took a long time for us. I have 5 smartphones, 5 tablets, two laptops, a DVD player, PlayStation, Nintendo, and printer that showed up in the list of devices on the circle app. You have to create a profile for each user and what you want filtered and not filtered. The process for setting up a user is fairly straight forward and intuitive if you are digitally savvy. If not, it will take some time. The bad thing about the setup of profiles is IT TOOK A LONG TIME FOR CIRCLE TO SAVE MY SETTINGS FOR EACH USER. what should have been a 15 minute setup time per user, took several hours and sometimes days for the circle to save the info. It would sometimes only save part of it, and sometimes it would tell me an update was needed and would occur in the next 24 hours. Until it did, I couldn't add a new user, or make major changes to a profile. In my experience, I have never come across a device that required me to wait 24 hours for an update. I decided that I would try to \"Force Stop\" the circle app. This eliminated the update problem. But it still took several hours of back and forth app stops and saving to get the profiles created. Not sure why it takes so long, but it does. I also felt committed to making the circle work because I had already purchased my older kids phones, and the younger kids tablets. I had to get it working.\n\n2. Device names do not come across in an easy way to identify. If you have a lot of devices to set up, you need to have them close by to go and find the IP addresses for them, because that is the only way you will be able to know what device belongs to which profile.\n\n3. The pause does not always work. We have paused the devices and waited to see how long it took for the devices to recognize that the internet was paused, ie... Youtube still plays the video for ten minutes after we hit pause, and sometimes longer, sometimes shorter. But it is not instantaneous. Knowing that one thing, would have changed our minds about our digital Christmas in 2016. But too late now.\n\n4. Unless you purchase the circle go monthly subscription, you are not able to control smartphones. They can shut the wifi off on the phone and have full access to whatever they want through data on your wireless plan. You will have to add parental control features on you wireless plan to control this. I suspected this was the case before buying our circle. I had already added the parental control through our cell carrier. As far as the circle go subscription, if it is as effective as the circle device, I imagine I will need to keep the parental controls in place on our wireless plan.\n\n5. My laptop will not allow me to access Bing maps, or other content that does not have a rating associated with it on the internet. I have to disable the circle to gain access to basic websites. Which defeats the purpose of having the circle. This is something that would have been a deal breaker in buying the circle for me as well. The first time it happened, I realized I had not thought it through very well. I do a lot of work online for my job. I have yet to find an internet filtering system or program that allows me to access everything I need to and protect my family from harmful sites. Basically, the internet, and filters will never allow for optimal use, until everyone in the world agrees to one set of filtering guidelines and standards and abides by them. That will never happen, so do not expect the circle to work flawlessly. There are harmful(virus, adult or other extreme content, malware infested, etc...) sites on the internet that can bypass filters and blockers. There will never be a sure fire way to defend against them all(including you apple users that think there are no apple os or ios viruses).\n\nI really wanted the circle to work well for us. It is doing what it advertised for the most part, but do not ever think you will be able to program and filter your devices to relieve yourself and your family from using digital technology in a responsible manner. Ultimately, these types of devices and filtering programs will fail. An individual who wants to subvert the system will do so. We have the circle now, and our use and feedback will help it become better. But we have realized it is more important for us to teach our kids responsibility with regard to their use of digital devices and let them govern themselves. Eventually they will have to learn for themselves what is and is not safe.\n\nI hope this has helped. I hope the tech gets better, and I hope I can teach my kids how to use tech in a responsible manner.",

                "review_body": "The Circle is a marvelous invention and I love it. I could have done some time management for my teenager's heavy internet use through the software for my router, but the router can't come close to the flexibility of this device. The Circle \"sees\" every device on your network and allows you to assign each one to specific users. Each user gets a profile in which you can set age-targeted basic filtering, on/off times, and bed and wake time.\n\nDoing all this through the phone app is a breeze, and you don't have to be in the house - the app controls the Circle from anywhere. And you can have the app on more than one device, so for us, my wife and I both have control over our internet via our phones. You can also use a Rewards feature to disable an off time and other things. And you can set all the devices you don't want to restrict to a \"Home\" profile or make them Unmanaged altogether. These and other features make for an extremely customizable level of control over any or all wifi enabled devices, and believe me, all mine are managed through it.\n\nOh, and in the app you have a Pause button both in the main screen (so you can stop the entire internet across all devices in your home network), and in the family members' profiles. It's like a kill switch! So if my kid does something super heinous, I can drop the consequence bomb of losing his internet instantly. It actually helped him choose his behaviors better, knowing he lives on his internet time. While not the only thing a good parent would use, it's a great part of the parenting toolkit.\n\nI also like that the company is really family-centric and is working on more enhancements like connecting with rewards and chore apps, etc.\nI haven't used the Disney content or feature, so I can't speak to that. Also, I had worried that this device would slow the internet speed of our wifi (or at least for the managed devices) but I'm happy to say it has no noticeable effect, including on high-demand activities like streaming and my son's gaming.\n\nI really recommend this device to my fellow parents for peace of mind. Set up is just a little tricky, but the directions are very good and they have a great support page online. After setup, we found that we don't use it much except to give rewards (extra time online) here and there and to add new devices to profiles. It has become an easy to use part of our lives.\n\nOne caveat: In the initial setup process, then when a new device is sensed later, some devices appear listed in the Circle app with a name that is easy to identify, like \"iPhone\". This is super helpful so you can know who to assign with device to. But many show up labeled with their MAC address instead, and some with weird names. For example, my kiddo's new PC is a PowerSpec brand from Microcenter, but showed up as \"ASUS...\" something or other. Basically, the Circle was naming the PC for its network card brand. I'm somewhat techie, so I don't mind getting on those odd-named devices to figure out which ones are which in Circle. I did that and then renamed them in the Circle app to something far easier, like \"Johny's PC\", etc. Again, most of this work was the evening I set up the Circle for the first time. It was about an hour or so. Now, when a new device is sensed (a visitor's phone, Nintendo DS, etc.), we can add it, leave it on the default Home profile (we leave that one unrestricted), or just ignore it since its not a permanent family member's device.\n\nSo with a little patience and just a pinch of techie-ness, you can set up a Circle and reap the benefits. Again, I highly recommend it! Final note: we've been using it for 5 months or so and works great. Power failures (often short in our area) will temporarily disable the Circle, and you get a notification that it's offline on your phone. Once the network and Circle are back up, you get another notification telling you it's back online. I like that, too.",

                "review_body": "My kids hate the Circle.  Does that tell you what you need to know?\n\nIt took me several tweaks before I had my Circle set up correctly, but now, two months into using it, I have come to really love it.\n\nFor reference, we live in a large house with one router and two extenders (which only means that there are multiple \"networks.\")  I have four kids, and their ages range from 7 to 14.  They have iPhones, iPods, iPads, 2 Xbox consoles, Playstation3 and Playstation4.  I have tried several different flavors of net-nannies and I have set up parental controls on several different routers over the years, but nothing has ever been worth the hassle of it all until this Circle.  This gives me more flexibility and customization than anything I've ever used, and it is also visual (on my iPhone) so I don't need to be a computer programmer to make sense of it.  REALLY, this thing is EASY.  And if you need help to get it set up properly, just ask on their Facebook page because they are incredibly committed to helping people.  I've never seen this degree of helpful Facebook customer service before, on any kind of product.\n\nThe beautiful part of Circle is that every device that is connected to the internet automatically appears in the DEVICES for your circle.  Some of them are easy to identify (e.g. \"Jimmy's iPad\") but some are more difficult (e.g. \"HUMAX Device\" or T0108000357180).  I started with the things I could positively identify, and then the rest became obvious over time.  Anytime a device joins the network, Circle will give you a notification.  So, if you unplug and replug your Amazon Fire Stick, or put your iPhone into airplane mode and then switch it back, you'll be able to identify and label the device in your Circle.\n\nOnce I figured out what each of my devices was, I assigned each one to a person.  If the device was used by all of us (like the TV in the living room) I assigned it to E (for everyone). One son has an iPhone, iPad, Xbox, and another child has iTouch, iPad, and Mac.  Another one has a Mac, an iPad, and an Xbox.  The fourth one only has an iPad and a Fire device.  Now, with devices set for each child, I can pause one kid's internet (on each of his devices) without messing up all of the other kids' internet.  Also, if my son is allowed to use his computer (for homework) but not his Xbox, I can pause ONLY the Xbox, and leave everything else connected.  (Also, if I have said, \"No Xbox for you!  One Week!\" but then forgotten to actually put a pause on the Xbox.  I can pull it up on my phone and see if he has turned it on.)  Likewise, if I have gone to work and forgotten to turn someone's internet back on, I can easily correct that and get him back in business.  The best part is that I can do all of it with an app on my phone.  I can do it from the front yard, the bank, the airport, or from another state.  Instantly.  For me, this is where Circle REALLY earns its stars.\n\nSimply stated, Circle will allow me to pause the internet for the entire house (say for dinner).  OR, it will allow me to pause the internet for one child (who's grounded) or for all the kids individually (until each one gets homework finished -- and then individually I can give wifi back to them as they earn it.)\n\nFor content, there are filters.  Using the settings for Filter Level, I have set up my youngest as kid, and my three older ones as teen.  I am able to completely disable Youtube for my 7 year old, who was pretty addicted to Disney Collector and Family Fun Pack before Circle came along.  On the Teen filter, I have the option to shut down many apps individually (e.g. Instagram, HBO, Twitter, Tumbler, Snapchat, YouTube).  I can give some or all or none to each kid, INDIVIDUALLY.  Separately, there is a custom option on each filter which will allow me to add in any specific website they are visiting that I don't want them to.  If I click on INSIGHTS (and this is on each child's profile) I can see every website he has visited today and how much time he spent there.\n\nTime Limits have proven to be my ACE IN THE HOLE for discipline.  My young teenager is now on a plan where if he doesn't cause any disruptions in the house he gets to maintain his internet time, and if he gets in trouble for something he loses an hour.  WOW -- what a changed kid!  It is effortless for me to change his limit (I just pull up the app on my phone) so he knows that I won't get busy and forget.  For once, I have a parenting tool that is SUPER EASY for me to wield.  If he does something sweet, I can bounce him up an hour.  It doesn't cost me anything and it actually has a value for him.\n\nBEDTIME does just what it says.  It shuts down their internet at bedtime without me having to realize the time and run around the house snatching electronics at 7:30, 8:00, 9:00 and 10:00.  It allows me to let the big kids have their internet later on weekends, but still have a limit so they don't watch Netflix until 2:00 am.  Week night bedtime limits can be set at a different time than weekend bedtime limits.  If one child always has Thursday Night projects for school that take him past the regular bedtime, I can remove Thursdays from the bedtime limit or turn bedtime off (when he asks me about it) and then back on when he is finished, easily from my phone.\n\nMy favorite part of Circle is that (now that I have it set up properly) I can easily control each device, or each child's devices from my phone with one or two clicks.  I feel like it has given the power back to me.  I know that there are sophisticated router setups that are also supposed to do this, but I haven't had luck with any of them.  I have read reviews from people saying that they couldn't set it up, or that it crashed the entire system, and I just don't have any idea where they are going wrong, but trust me, they are doing something wrong.\n\nAs an aside, the day after I set up my Circle, we had a problem with the internet and of course I blamed the Circle and unplugged it.  Let me tell you that it STAYED ON.  It has a battery inside, so if your kids ever get the bright idea to disable the circle and run amok on the internet, their attempts will be foiled!  As it turns out, the problem with the internet was that I hadn't paid the bill (oops!) and it had nothing to do with the Circle.  However, I forgot to go back and plug it in (after everything was resolved).  It worked for a month before it started sending me messages on my phone that I needed to plug it back in.\n\nAlso, with regard to the extenders.  I thought that the Circle wouldn't work if the kids just moved from the regular router to the extenders and I believed it to be a serious flaw.  However, I have since learned that if I pause the device, it doesn't matter which network the kids plug into (because the extenders feed from the actual router).  The device will pause regardless of the network name.\n\nOne other thing is data on the iPhone.  There is a plan to control your child's data use, but I have not taken advantage of it.  I realized that the MYATT app has a place where I can easily disable data, so for my one rebellious child, I just shut down his data when he's at home, and then he is forced to use the wifi, and my limits placed in Circle will keep him in check.  If I want him to have data (vacation, etc.) I just turn it back on in the ATT app.  If you child's device has access to data, you will only have so much control over it with Circle.\n\nAlso, it is true that the iPad will allow you to block some apps and some sites.  Circle isn't the ONLY way that you can get the job done.  But for me, it has absolutely been the easiest.",

They have an old home with lots of old building materials.....very dense walls.\n\nI ran a speed test on their 3-5 year old router from the company.  Hooked up directly to it.  The speeds were great.  Then checked the internal wifi speeds.  AWFUL!!!  Ordered this for them and they now have superfast internet speeds throughout their house.  No extenders needed.  They are very happy.\n\nThe only negative is that I tried to purchase an extended warranty directly from the company as they offer support and replacement.  I spent at least two hours on the phone setting this up with an agent from abroad that did not speak English well.  They'd sent me a discount coupon to use by email.  The agent went through the entire process and never applied the discount, although I mentioned it numerous times.  Kicking it up to his supervisor was not help.  I would not go through this hassle again.  I'm still waiting for my refund for the charge that they placed on my credit card.",

The stock firmware supports usual home router features. It is clunky, but no worse than other home router interfaces. The basic features are easy enough to use.\n\nI only used it stock for a short time, then upgraded to OpenWRT, which was very easy to do using stock firmware flash UI. All the hardware seems to be fully supported by the latest bcm53xx generic image, except for the buttons and ethernet port LEDs (which can also be made to work but I haven't bothered yet). OpenWRT installation leaves 20 MB free for the overlay filesystem, which was enough for me to install all the OpenWRT packages I wanted without putting the overlay on an external disk.  OPENWRT NOTE: Use \"radio0\" for the high 5GHz channel (153ish), and \"radio2\" for the low 5GHz channel (44ish), don't do it the other way around or reception will be bad.\n\nINTERNATIONAL USERS NOTE: The router I received was new in box but pre-locked to the United States region, limiting which channels can be used for regulatory compliance.

                "review_body": "I've had mixed feelings about this router. I purchased it five years ago and it worked pretty well initially. After 2 or 3 years, I would occasionally have issues where the wifi would hang, but all I had to do was reboot the router, and I could usually even do that from their original software app. By 2018/2019, things had progressed with with firmware to the point that it started to become unstable again. It would hang and the old app was no longer able to access the modem. I had difficulty accessing the settings and sometimes rebooting was not even enough to bring it back on-line. I might have to turn it off for a couple of days and go completely dark before I could get it to come on. I have since figured out what to tweak to get it working. Through some troubleshooting, I discovered that messages were leaving the network and going out to the internet, and packets would come back through the cable modem, but they were not getting passed back once they reached the wifi router. I have not figured out what is wrong exactly, but I did figure out that since rebooting is not enough, I could tweak the MAC address. If I change it slightly, for instance, I might change the last Hex pair from B0 to B1, then reboot the wifi access point, it will come back on line and everything will work great for awhile. If it acts up again in a week, I will go back in and either go from B1 to B2, or just change it from B1 back to B0. Typically, B0 will work again after a short break.\n\nThis is all very frustrating and is especially difficult to do when away from home. Nothing worse than getting the frantic message \"Daddy! The Internet is down! Can you fix it? Pleasssse?\" while you are 12K miles away from home.\n\nI've decided to start looking for a replacement. I was considering a newer Netgear initially, but the more I'm reading, the more I'm convincing myself that the problems are not with my hardware, but with the Firmware installed on it. If netgear would actually harden the firmware for the existing line-up of products and then experiment with new R&D instead of existing customers, perhaps I wouldn't be looking at going back to market and looking at their competitors' solutions.",

Most of the time it's something we just take for granted.  That is until you realize that you've added multiple devices recently and realize they just aren't running as fast.  That is why I upgraded to the Nighthawk X6 AC4300. I have a total of 23 devices on my home network. Multiple Iphones, Ipads, Blueray players etc., not to mention my computers.  This amount of traffic has to be managed and my old router just couldn't get it done. I read the reviews on the Nighthawk and thinking about the multiple antennas, the ability to detect the best frequency for the hardware and manage traffic like a buy intersection, I figured I'd give it a try. What a pleasant surprise, setup was a breeze, zero technical issues and I've found all of my devices are working faster and more reliably.  I set it up myself and in total for 23 devices, it took me about 45 minutes. I love the Netgear Genie software as well, it lets you see and name all your devices and manage them individually. I'd rate the Nighthawk a 10 out of 10.  It's pricey no doubt, but if you can afford the best then this router steps up to and exceeds the challenge.  I've been a longtime user of Netgear Hardware and I know there are other great products out there but from my standpoint, I think I bought the very best.\nI can't give you a bunch of technical info, but I thought a honest opinion of a new piece of hardware is just as useful.",

If you have a security system with motion detectors don't put this router too near to the motion detectors. Mine was about 18\" away and it was causing my alarm to go off. Moved it and problem went away. Thoroughly tested it and that definitely was the problem.\n\nMy previous router was a Linksys E4200. As with all things, technology improves and upgrades are necessary. I did the research and the NetGear Nighthawk X6 AC3200 (R8000) had very good reviews (and a lot of them). I immediately was impressed with the ease to install it. Design is excellent, except for one thing. I put my router on top of my PC and the router housing slides around easily. I went to Home Depot and got some stick on rubber feet about 3/8\" in diameter (in the cabinet hardware isle) and mounted four of them on the bottom of the router. Worked great. I like the fact that the lights on top label what they stand for. Connecting devices is a breeze (even with my 13yr old Sony DVR I keep in the guest BR). Accessing the settings is also easy and have lot of tweaks available. As for speed, this router can handle tons of devices and bullet speed. The hardware automatically puts devices on the fastest band (there is one 2.4GHz and two 5GHz Wi-Fi bands). I  was all ready to ramp up my cable bandwidth. No need. The router fixed it. Visually seeing the attached devices is also a plus. Well worth the money.",

That gives it a half star.\n\nIf you are like me and want to tweak every setting under the sun like setting the DNS so that you don't have to use your ISP's. If you want to use and tweak IPv6 settings there is a way to do that too (more on this in a bit and it's not pretty).  Half star for this.\n\nNow for everything that is bad about this.\nRight off the top. The download speed on this sucks and was inconsistent and before you blame the connection. I bought a Linksys AC4000 EA9300 router that has almost all the functionality that this router has and my download speed improved dramatically and has been rock solid (not up down and sideways) for a week now. No stars for this.\n\nIPv6 Yes you can set this router up for IPv6. With Xfinity it never EVER worked right and I tried every setting under the sun. Including trying to let it Autoconfigure itself. When I let it do that every single time it would set itself up and a different mode (DHCP, 6/4 Tunnel as it is listed on the router, etc). Even when I manually set it up to what was the correct settings it dumps them after 24 hours. I finally turned it off. No stars\n\nLastly for the last 2 weeks if I made any changes to it (see the first line, I am an IT person so I like to mess around with things and then fix them) it would crash after I made the smallest change and I mean CRASH as in reboot itself.\n\nAfter a month of crappy download speed, thinking it was Xfinity's fault (modem), or the physical cable I went out and purchased the Linksys router that I mentioned. It hasn't crashed, it handles IPv6 just fine (it even sets it up on its own which ok I don't get to play with that but it works I'm happy), the firewall is lightyears better than this thing and even though they are hidden I can change the DNS settings.\n\nSeriously after my experience with this router, I would never by another piece of Netgear equipment again and I am planning to get rid of the Netgear switches I have in my house (that is how disappointed I am).\n\nStay away from this thing.",

                "review_body": "The product itself is 5 stars.  Best router I've ever had.  It runs my security system, Lutron Lighting, 2 Apple TV's, 2 Roku TV's, Mac, Ipad, an Ecobee, an echo, 3 dots, and multiple cell phones all at the same time with no issues at all.  My movies stream better than ever before.  My security system arms faster than ever before.  HOWEVER.......mine died.  It just literally one day kicked the bucket.  I had it about 5 months.  I get it....sometimes electronics just break....it happens.  I like this one so much, that I am running out to buy another one of the same, and get my house back-up and running.  What I'm really disgusted with is Netgears Customer Service.  An hour on the phone for the guy to ask me every question under the sun, and yet in the end I still had to say \"sir, the unit is dead, no matter what you ask me to do it will not work\".  So they shipped me a new one (so I thought).  Plugged it in, ANOTHER HOUR ON THE PHONE, and the lady says well that one is a bad unit we'll get you out another one.  Really??  Again?  I asked if it was refurbished and yes it was!  So a unit 5 months old gets replaced with refurbished.  I refused to take another refurbished one, contacted Amazon, explained my dilemma, and got the best possible customer service from Amazon, and they took care of my problem flawlessly.  So 5 star on the unit, 5 star for Amazon, but Netgear customer service is a freakin joke!  I give them a ZERO!",

                "review_body": "A number of problems with the Nighthawk X6 continue even after the latest firmware update to V1.0.0.100.\n\nI have the X6 connected as an access point to a Century Link Modem. The CL modem wireless radio is disabled and it provides static addresses to the X6. I have a Sonos bridge hardwired, a Netgear ReadyNAS hardwired and a Surface Pro 3 hardwired.. X6 wireless devices consist of a Dell laptop, a windows phone, and an Amped Wireless extender. A printer is connected to the USB port of the X6 to provide wireless printing.\n\nThe Sonos setup consists of the previously mentioned bridge, two Play 3's, one Playbar, one ZP80 and One ZP100 which have all been assigned static IP addresses.\n\nThe first problem noticed is that the ZP80 and ZP100 will not stay online. I am running the Windows version of the Sonos controller and both the ZP80 and ZP100 would show up in the controller for a few moments then dis-appear. Then sometime later they may show up again. Their existence is erratic at best. So, I assumed maybe they were incompatible with the newer Play 3's and Playbar so I took them out and was enjoying my music both from the NAS and from services such as Pandora and Amazon Prime.\n\nThis is when the second problem showed up. A song would be playing and before it ended another song would start. Sometimes a song would have just started when it would skip to the next song. This was a mystery to me as it was happening on both a service and with music from my NAS which was hardwired to the X6.\n\nI was replacing a Netgear WNDR3700v3 with the X6 so decided to take out the X6 and put back in the 3700. Magic, no music skipping AND both the ZP80 and ZP100 came online and stayed online.\n\nThis gave me an idea... put the X6 back in but plug the Sonos bridge into the CL modem directly, not through the X6 wired to the CL modem. Interestingly, all zone players came online and stayed online but the music from my NAS skipped. I then plugged the NAS directly into the CL modem and to no surprise it stopped the skipping.\n\nSo, it appears the X6 has some problems with the wired ports. At this point I might as well go back to the 3700 as the wireless range seemed to be as good and the only thing I would be missing is the wireless printing support in the X6.\n\nUnfortunately I discarded the boxes the X6 came in so am not sure I can return to Amazon. It  appears I have paid $300 for wireless printer support... something I could have bought for under $50.\n\nSo as others have said... the X6 is a great idea... just not ready for primetime.\n\nI will be happy to revisit this review if Netgear manages to provide firmware that allows me to utilize the capabilities they advertise for the X6.",

My old one worked fine, never lost connectivity, never had to worry, we were always connected. But it was older, seemed slow at times, so I upgraded. Or so I thought.\n\nFrom the get-go, the router wouldn\u2019t connect. Had to jump through hoops to set it up and troubleshoot. But, I didn\u2019t leave a review because I thought maybe it was just me. Now, it\u2019s been a year. And it\u2019s still awful.\n\nA year of waking up (like today\u2014Christmas morning) to the router working one minute and the next I have no connection. My devices show my wireless network. When I click to connect (although it should automatically) I\u2019m told I have the wrong password. And the password hasn\u2019t changed in a year. The lights show it\u2019s on and connected to the internet. My wired connections work. Yet WiFi doesn\u2019t.\n\nSo, it\u2019s back to powering it off. Unplugging it. Turning it back on. Waiting\u2026. Waiting\u2026. Waiting\u2026. There\u2019s all the lights! And all my devices are saying I have the wrong password. Again\u2026 the password is 100% correct. So I go thru these steps again. Then it finally connects. This happens sporadically 2-3 times a month. For the last year.\n\nI also rated it low for the signal. My previous WiFi router had no issues sending a powerful signal in my 1000 sq ft house \u2014 it worked in the basement, garage, and all through my yard. This one barely connects in the garage, barely connects in the yard, and half the time it just stops connecting at all for no reasons whatsoever. We have around 10 devices connected at once and there\u2019s a noticeable drop in speed when a couple are streaming.\n\nI hate leaving negative reviews, but this product has been an expensive mistake. Not only the price of the device, but I\u2019ve had to rely on my hotspot so regularly for work that I had overage charges.  And dealing with again on Christmas morning when everyone wants to try their new gadgets and watch tv and you know, be connected to the internet\u2026 I\u2019ve had it.\n\nBefore buying this device, I thought Netgear was an industry leader. After this year old experience, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll buy any netgear product for a long time, if ever.",

The app on your phone that controls the router is pretty cool and works great.  The issue I'm having is interrupted internet signal.  It is really hard to determine if this is the router that is transmitting a disrupted signal or my internet provider.  What I can say is that my prior router never did this.  We will go through periods of time when the internet signal turns on and then off over and over for an extended period of time.  Then, out of the blue, it will stop.  I have updated firmware and rebooted the router several times.  In the last several days this has not occurred.  So, at this time I am optimistic that any bugs in the software or firmware will be fixed.  Obviously I will also check with the internet provider to see if the problem is on their end as well.  So, for now, I'm in a wait and see period.  I will also add that I had installed one of these routers at my office about a year ago. I have not had the same issues with that router.  That one has been flawless.  Hopefully the interruptions will  cease to exist and all will be well.",

Beware I suspect that a large number of the reviews are from the company.  The other option is that other customers have been incredibly lucky to not have received a defective unit, and did not have to deal with customer service.\n\n1.  Device worked as described for 1 month, it worked well for 1 month with good WIFI coverage.\n2.  After 1 month the device became increasingly unreliable, shutting off every one hour and resetting.\n3. The more devices connected the more often the item disconnected.\n4.  First call to customer service the rep said, \"if you restarted the router you probably damaged it\", and \"your computer has infections that somehow damaged it\".  As evidence he used the event log as proof that I was to blame for everything that happened.  Having more common sense than a rock, I know that the event log of every computer is full of events which have nothing to do with my router.  Also of note old router (50$) works without issues though without all the bells and whistles you would expect from a 300$ router.  Also there are no \"infections\" on my computer as I have never had any issues, and all virus and malware scans are negative.  Clearly the tactic of netgear's, customer \"service\" is to prevent you from returning your defective device by attempting to blame the defect on the customer.  Unfortunately he was an early trainee and lacked the sophistication to intelligently pull the wool over my eyes.\n5.  I asked to speak to his manager, he said, \"There is no manager here\",  Also refused to give me his name.  Decided to hang up, angry and sad that I could not exact revenge for his obvious fraud.\n6.  Since out of the 90 day return period decided to luck it and get a replacement.\n7.  Customer service tried to verify my device which was purchased from Amazon.com as a brand new item only to find it was registered under a \"charles\" (not my name.)  And I couldn't therefore return the device without proof of purchase...  Beyond angry at this point.  Apparently someone Amazon, or Netgear is selling routers marketed as \"new\" are actually refurbished or not-new.  The previous owner, \"Charles\" had enough time to even register my device.  The other possibility is another stall tactic to prevent returns of their defective items.\n\nWe will see after I call in another 2 business days how far the Netgear/Amazon/Indian technical \"support\" scam goes.\nI've got another 6 months to attempt to return this defective item before my 1 year hardware warranty expires.\n\nSummary:\nDO NOT BUY THIS ROUTER\n\n1. Not stable/ disconnects frequently\n2. Horrible customer support/crooked\n3. Your new router may have been previously owned by someone who already registered it, which means you can't return it and you can't receive customer support.\n4. If you get lucky and get a working router and don't have to deal with customer support, you will be encouraging this extremely poor business practice.  Help put a stop to this fraud and don't buy from Netgear until they control their customer support",

I am extremely happy with my choice...  The set-up was simple, the directions were clear and easy to follow.  I had the router installed with all of my devices using it within a half hour- and the lions share of that time was spent going from room to room adding my devices.  Which gets me to the first feature- the ability to handle multiple devices.  To say that my family are techno-geeks would be an understatement.  We routines use iPhones, iPads, Gaming (Xbox 1), four windows-based workstations/laptops, a Verizon network extender, wireless printers, and multiple smart tvs and Rokus.  We easily have 15 of these devices competing for bandwidth on any given evening.  The Nighthawk has had absolutely no issue keeping up with this demand without dropping any devices or rebooting.  On the topic of speed- it is akin to the days when I was riding high-end sport bikes- there's no issue with lagging- when you point and click, the results are instantaneous.  We have experienced no issues what-so-ever with video streaming/buffering.  Configurability?  Yup, it's got that too.  I'm not a big techy, but with the literature on the internet I quickly educated myself with the benefits of using a tri-band- and the interface for this puppy is user friendly too.  I highly recommend this product if you are looking for a tri-band, and I highly recommend taking the time to learn and understand how to actually use it- trust me, it's not rocket science!  PS- my dsl supplier is Windstream so I can tell you that it does work with that company's modems!",

The initial support call, said no, however after updating the feedback on Amazon another support team contacted me ans have been working with me regarding the issues.  We reconfigured Wireless setting and updated firmware-- so far one day with out any issue...\n\nDO NOT BUY THIS ROUTER--- or ANY Netgear.\nRouter random disconnects -  Support wanted to charge me 90.00 to troubleshoot after hdw warranty out by 11 days..\nThree day waiting for support.... and now WiFi has gone out intermittently",

                "review_body": "I had both routers Netgerar r8000 and the Linksys WRK 1900ac and put them through all the tests. The main concerns for me were stability and performance.\n\nRange - Bot were very good reaching hard to get signal areas in my 3,000 sq foot home. Linksys can be fined tuned better because of the ability to aim the antennas.\n\nPerformance - I do allot of Hi Def Flac audio streaming from my server in the basement that has an Asus 56 ac adapter. No matter what I tried the Netgear would always have a sort of pause every few minutes that would interrupt the stream and cause the audio to skip. The second I replaced the Netgear with the Lynksys the audio ran perfectly. Its seemed to be some sort of buffer overrun problem.\n\nStressing the routers - One test I use to see performance is to get 2 laptops, 2 ipads and an android phone, all in same room as router. Set ALL to 5.0 ghz channel and stream 1080p video. With the Smart connect on or off the Netgear after a few minutes would have a slight buffer. The Lynksys in the same scenario was smooth even after a 12 minute HD video stream to all 5 clients. Can it be the processor?\n\nBuild - There is no doubt that the build quality of the Linksys is far superior than the Netgear. The Netgear fells cheaply made, those of you that have both will know what I am talking about. Lynksys also has built in fan for times the router gets stressed.\n\nFirmware - DDWRT support will come for the Netgear, Lynksys is still slow in developing due to the driver information being released. Netgear would have an advantage if DDWRT firmware is your concern. Hopefully linksys will get the DDWRT as promised. Stock firmware as it stands today the Lynksys has the advantage. The Netgear smart connect is spotty and there is some sort of buffering issue going on with it.\n\n  IMO for 299 dollars its just not worth it. The Lynksys at 249 is reasonable for a product that at this point is more reliable, much better build quality, and has better real world performance.\n\nFuture firmware development may enhance the r8000 and the performance issues may get better but it seems to me this was rushed out to be the first on the block with 3200.\n\n  Netgear support is useless, the answers they gave me were ridiculous. I see they have a full time person scouring these review with comments, interesting.\n\nThe Netgear r8000 is on its way back to Amazon, the Linksys WRT1900ac is currently running on my system with no problems.\n\nCC",

                "review_body": "I write this review after attempting to integrate this into my home system several weeks ago.\nThen having to replace it about 1.5 weeks later because the ethernet internet connection kept dropping intermittently (basic ethernet that even my old-and-busted $20 Cisco E1200 router had no problems keeping up and online).\nThe replacement, however, had the same ethernet internet connection issues less than a week later.\n\nA few things that made me decide to return this router:\n\n1. Ethernet connection issues. Kept dropping intermittently for no apparent reason. Wifi worked fine though (but what true gamer/geeker uses Wifi for their command base?)\n- Checked several forums, and seems to be an ongoing issue even now (2015-dec)\n- Tried upgrading the router to the latest firmware. Note, that the actual \"check for updates\" GUI (Graphic User Interface) does not actually give you the latest stable release - you have to go to Netgear's site DIRECTLY to truly get the most stable release. That said, I tried the GUI's interpretation of what was the latest firmware, and also downloaded the ACTUAL latest firmware from Netgear's site directly. Tested both. Both failed to fix ethernet connectivity issue.\n- Ethernet connectivity is the most basic feature of a router. By definition. Why would I spent $260+ on a router that doesn't... rout?\n\n2. OpenVPN support sucks.\n- I am currently testing the ASUS RT-AC68U Router instead of the Netgear. Though the ASUS is only a tiny bit slower (read specs on speed) than the Netgear, the GUI is incredibly easy to work with, filled with tons of helpful tooltips and options for the VPN newbie OR guru.\nNetgear is NOT intuitive at all, and most of it is focused on PC support only.\n- The forums that Netgear keeps trying to tell me about (including flyers and emails I was spammed with after my purchase) did not give me any positive response or even any helpful hints as to how to figure out and set up the OpenVPN server support promised on Netgear's product summary page. Disappointed.\n\n3. At first glance, this router truly seems like an awesome machine. However, a closer look reveals that:\n- realistically, you may never ever need to use the \"third band\" of the \"tri-band\" feature\n- if you're really in love with netgear and want the same specs, but realistically aren't going to be running several gaming hubs under your home (on Wifi, for whatever reason), you might save some doh by trying the R7000 instead. Same specs, just without the way-too-futuristic-at-this-time third 5Ghz band.\n- the actual WiFi speeds fail to beat even the ASUS RT-AC68U, which is half the price of the Netgear router\n- support is very... poor. Their online guides and even community forums are disappointing. Their registration process is a little confusing and glitchy (refreshed and confirmed without me actually submitting any information, and then followed with a message that my product was already registered... except it had no details to show me?). And without this registration, I wasn't even sure if the \"free 90 day support\" was going to be accessible.\nI cannot say for the phone support, however, because I found that it was outsourced to Indian call bases (I'm horrible at interpreting foreign accents, so I passed on that).\n\nOnly works on wireless.\nNot a good buy.",

                "review_body": "Expensive but definitely making a big difference in our house.  I had an old Buffalo router that I flashed with DD-WRT to get a more useful interface but it ran its course and it was time for a new router.  We kept losing signals on our phones and just not getting good performance.  So, this time I splurged and went with a high end router this time--why not---better us enjoying our money that the govt right :-)\n\nSo far, we've noticed Xbox games updating much faster, all devices remain connected and when I check attached devices this thing really does load balance across both 2.4 and 5 GHz ranges...sweet!  Coverage is also much better in all areas of the house and outside with a much stronger signal.  Wifi, in general, is just working better inside.  Keep in mind, this won't change your carrier's plan of course but maxing out speed inside your house gives the faster experience all around since you remove the bottleneck inside our house which is usually the router.\n\nI also plugged in a laser jet printer that did not have wireless and used the ready share option and voila'  --- laser jet printer accessible to all devices.  You just need to download a small app from Netgear and install on the devices you want to print from...very easy to install and no config to do as it simply looks for the r8000 router and ready share devices. Connected in a couple seconds and I was printing immediately after.\n\nUnit is definitely larger than the usual cheapo routers but it's not crazy big.  If you want the best coverage from a system with multiple antennas and processes it has to be bigger than the usual routers.\n\nSo far, so good and we are happy with this purchase and I expect this to last for a long time.",

                "review_body": "For basic service (i.e. network routing), the router works fairly well.  Occasionally, I will experience disconnects on a particular device (e.g. my PC or cell phone) while the other devices remain connected. If I restart the router, all the devices are reconnected, but one will eventually drop out again, requiring another restart.\nThe software that comes with the router, Netgear GENIE, includes a function called ReadySHARE, which allows you to remotely access a hard drive connected to the router's USB port. It works for my cell phone (Apple), but not for Windows 10 - unless I log in as a local administrator on the PC. Even though my normal login has Admin privileges, I am unable to access the hard drive. I tried to work with Netgear's tech support, and they are absolutely worthless. They could only ask their flowchart questions - is your router on?, can you connect to your router?, what is your IP address?, etc. After going through all those questions, they wanted me change the BIOS to a previous (earlier) version. That is a poor option. Not only does it not address the problem I have with ReadySHARE, it only adds other problems the latest BIOS fixed.\n\nMar 2017 update - My service call was upgraded to the next level of tech support in January 2017. This person was much more knowledgeable and we arrived at a work around solution to this problem. Recently, I upgraded the NETGEAR genie (Version 2.4.38) and the router's firmware (V1.0.2.32). I would recommend you check that you have installed the latest versions - improvements in stability and functionality.",

I did find the speed test was surprisingly slow.\n\nMy major complaint is the parental controls requires a $50 per year subscription. I would understand paying for a security subscription (which is another subscription service you need to sign up for) but not parental controls. It does offer the use of OpenDNS services that provides content filtering, but that is available for any router that allows you change your DNS settings. What you don't get as part of the router is the ability to control and limit usage and block out certain times as in the case of bedtimes.\n\nThe BASIC service only provides: Filter, Pause, History\nThe PREMIUM provides: Usage, Filter, Time Limits, BedTime, Pause, OffTime, Rewards, History through the Circle app for $50 per year\n\nToughing the device has parental controls, yet making you pay extra for the service is rather deceptive. In either case, using OpenDNS or the paid Circle is based on an external service which most kids in sixth grade know how to work around using a VPN.\n\nIf you don't care about parental controls or adjusting advance features perhaps this router is fine for you. I did notice that a simple speed test on a wireless device on a 8011ac WiFi adapter only registered under 100 MBs for both upload and download on a gigabit internet connection. While I didn't troubleshoot why the wireless connection was not in excess of 300MBs, I was expecting much higher speeds.\n\nI will be looking for a different router.",

My ISP offered a higher tier service 400Mbs and the Linksys was not going to cut it.\nI have used this now for a week with out any issues to report. 1st off I updated the firmware right out of the box. I have 3 iPads, 4 iPhones, 2 Xboxs, Apple TV, Roku 3, Samsung Smart TV, HP Wireless printer, and multiple computers all running wirelessly off this router. The coverage is excellent. Where the Xboxs are located I could not get a stable 5ghz signal to them with the Linksys but with the Netgear AC3200 i have a very strong signal. I tested this by streaming 1080p movies from my Plex server to the Xbox. Before it would periodically stop and buffer, several movies in and this is not a problem. Next the speed is great. I have done several large file copy tests from my laptop which runs 802.11n and my desktop which runs 802.11ac. I get a very constant 250+Mbs stream. I do not have any other 802.11ac machines to really test speed with.\nThe router does not impede WAN performance at all. I have seen some routers that impact or reduce true WAN throughput, for example my Linksys would only give me 75% of total available WAN bandwidth. With the Netgear my speeds are consistent regardless of whether I am connected directly to my Motorola SB6183, to the router wired or wireless.\nI was a little concerned after reading some reviews about dropping signals. I can say that I have tested iPads, iPhones and laptops all an the 5Ghz range walking around 3000sqf home and have not seen the drop issue. I also have strong coverage in the 5Ghz range throughout the house and even into the backyard and garage.\nBonus the desktop application of Netgear Genie has an airprint feature. This allows my apple devices to print to my non-airprint HP laser printer.",

                "review_body": "I purchased this router because I wanted a high quality home router, with the ability to install open source third party firmware.  I could have gotten something that uses pfSense, but that will be my next venture.  For now, this will do.\n\nOnce you install the correct firmware on this router (I recommended one in the headline), you will have access to a whole host of interesting options.  If you aren't very tech savvy, the terms will get lost on you - so I won't bother.  However, if you live in the United States and are at all concerned about people monitoring your internet connection, you may be delighted to know that you can install your VPN settings into this router, and secure your entire home network.  Every device that receives internet from this router will automatically use your VPN, as long as it is turned on in the router.\n\nThe default firmware comes with an OpenVPN Server - but this is not what you need to achieve the effect I mentioned above.  You need a router with an OpenVPN Client.  The only way to get this in a consumer router (besides the type that use pfSense), is to flash custom open source firmware on it.  These routers aren't really built for this purpose, so you will take a hit in overall internet speed (until OpenVPN supports multi-threading), but the privacy/security you get by installing a VPN Client at the router level (which would place your wired/wireless connected Kodi device, for instance, behind a VPN), is worth it.  I'm not advocating that you use it for those purposes, but in this day and age, you'd be stupid to do something like that without using a VPN.\n\nWhen the VPN is turned off, the speeds on this router are phenomenal, and the range is excellent with these antennas.  I'm extremely happy with this purchase.  And let's face it, this is one of the coolest looking routers on the market.",

The router power light was flashing witch according to the NETGEAR website indicated a bad router, or the router was updating firmware.  I finally contacted tech support in India, support ticket 24706929, and the support person had me turn off and on everything in my system which of course did not work, and told me he would call me back, this was after two to three hours on the phone.  Tech support never did call back.  I then received an email from Netgear telling me they were closing the ticket. I have returned the router to Amazon and expect a new one today, I will update after I try the new one to see if it works.  NETGEAR tech support is very bad!!\n\nUpdate:\n\nGot my second Router today!!  I do have it working, although it did take some time to get it working correctly.  The first router was defective, as I only had two lights on the router that ever came on, this one lit up like a Christmas tree when I first powered on the router.  The browser connection genie never did see my internet connection even though I was connected to the internet and able to download the Netgear Genie software and that software works for most of the router settings. I have not completely finished using all the settings but so far so good. On a side note, tech support did try to contact me today and left a message, wished they would have left a number for me to return the call.",

                "review_body": "WOW! A few weeks ago I had a new cable provider come out to install service because AT&T Uverse just wasn't cutting the mustard. I have been with them for many, many years but the internet was just slow. On speed tests it was saying we were getting almost 24 Mbps, but we kept getting the buffering wheel on videos, and snap chat was not working for my wife and daugher. Facebook videos and photos would not load, heck....even Google Drive was S-L-O-W. When the installer came out, he asked how many devices we have on wireless. 3 smart phones, 2 Chromebooks, 2 tablets, 3 Chromecasts, 2 Uverse wireless cable boxes, Nest thermostat, Hub for 5 wireless porch lights, wireless printer, then all the bluetooth headphones and speakers. I never thought about overloading Uverse. The installer said to think of your router as a highway(freeway), if you're driving late at night or early in the morning traffic runs smoothly (ah hah moment #1), when you drive on the same highway at rush hour it takes much longer to get the same distance (ah hah moment #2). Believe it or not he said \"not to switch providers and invest in a wireless router\". He said \"the biggest thing to remember is you get what you pay for. If you get a cheap $20 router it is not going to help with your situation, because of all the devices you have. You need something that will handle a lot of devices\". Well..........he was right. It took me a little bit to get this hooked up, and I wound up doing something wrong. It worked, but my speed got cut in 1/2. I finally had the time to contact support and they walked me through step by step corrections, and now everything is GREAT. This thing is AWESOME!!!! No problems running almost all of our devices at once. If you're reading reviews on this router, you know what the cost is, bite the bullet and make the investment. You won't be disappointed.",

It appears this has been an issue with this router and other Netgear routers.

The range has certainly improved, I no longer need an extender to reach the opposite end of my house.\n\nI have multiple devices connected, with the last count of 17 devices connected between 2 people and things are running smoothly.

                "review_body": "10/2016 Update:  I'm changing my rating of this router to \"I hate it\".  Last week, all of a sudden, a couple months after the 12 month manufacturer\u2019s warranty expired, all the Ethernet ports, including the WAN/Internet port went dead, with no warning.  The wireless functions still worked.  Just straight up died.  I did the usual factory reset on it and reloaded the firmware but no dice.  For a $300 router this is horrible.  I really wanted to like this router as I never had an issue with it when it DID work, but went hardware dies literally faster than any other router I've had, and it's the most expensive one I've ever bought, I'm on to another brand.  I'll still buy Netgear switches, but sorry you lost confidence in your routers.  Sorely disappointed :(  Hope my credit card warrenty exstension benfit will cover the cost of replacement.\n\nAfter my older DLink router went bust, I was in the market for a new router that was more powerful and could handle the growing streaming needs of the household.  A fellow IT friend recommended this one.  Although it was a little spendy, I picked it up since I needed the signal distance and wanted something that was reliable, as I work from home regularly.  If I'm paying $60+ a month for internet, why get by with a $90 router?  So far the router has performed well and I do get better signal throughout my 130yr old three story house.  I put the router in the basement, approximately in the middle of the house.  I can even get a signal in the back of my property now, where I couldn't before.  It was fairly easy to setup and I haven't had to reboot it in the month since it's been in service.  I haven't played with all the settings it has, but they did look to be extensive enough for the average needs.  I did not feel it got too hot or needed any kind of internal fan.  Time will tell, as it does with any router, on how long this thing will last.  For the money, it needs to last just as long or longer than my previous DLINK, which made it 4yrs before giving up the ghost.\n\nUpdate 2/9/2016 - So far this router has been rock solid and has not required a reboot to clear it up or to get it back online.  The speeds seem to be excellent and the range is great as well.  I do have to dock it one star for it's pretty pathetic lack of granulated parental controls and schedule blocking.  You can sign up for OpenDNS.org and use their blocking lists, but only if you use the NetGear Genie app on ALL your devices and log into it with special bypass accounts anytime you want to use the internet.  Blocking websites is an all or nothing deal, I can't block websites just for individual IPs/MACs.  Another glaring missing feature that I've had on older routers is the ability to block network access for specific period of times for a specific IP/MAC.  Where did that go NETGEAR?  I can block devices outright, I can setup times when NO ONE can use the router, but not just certain devices (ie: a kid's tablet at night).  Disappointed in the lack of granular features and parental controls that force you to use apps to login to special accounts.",

That must mean it's faster, right?\n\nBut for real, the Nighthawk has helped in our house immensely. We have a bunch of devices - 4 phones, 8 tablets, 5 laptops, 3 Rokus, a desktop stream out Plex video, etc, etc. Even though the old ASUS N66U \"Dark Knight\" was supposed to be a great router, it never worked as well as I expected it to, especially with our republic wireless phone-over-wifi service. We kept getting missed and \"they can't hear me\" calls, etc. This new router has greater range and better performance overall, and our call quality has improved immensely. No more bad calls and we can now use the Roku in the guest house. This new router has two 5GHz radios, so I put the Rokus and as many other devices as possible on 5GHz to help spread the love. We now have no problem all streaming at the same time while talking on the wifi phones (we have 100mbps internet service).\n\nIt's been 3 weeks or so and I haven't had to reboot it once. Good times. I have not turned on QoS yet, so not sure how well it does. I did benchmark copying data to a USB stick in the device, and it did well (don't recall the actual figures, sorry, but as expected).\n\nAs an aside: I am using the N66U as a repeater now, plugged directly into my main desktop on the other end of the house. It connects to this new Nighthawk router over 5GHz and repeats to other devices over 2.4GHz. This gives me 243Mbps from the desktop to the router where I was only getting 112Mbps before, and I don't lose half my bandwidth from repeating on same band. This setup has helped increase our effective range on this side of the house, and I can get wifi in the garage too. It's been solid, though I have had to reboot the N66U once (maybe I got a bad N66U).",

                "review_body": "Awesome wireless router. It's finally solved all the slow speed and dead space issues. I'm extremely happy with it.Hello,\nI hope this helps anyone considering purchasing this router. The Nighthawk X6 AC3200 Smart Wifi router(R8000) is definitely worth the extra money. Being that it's a bit more expensive than most of the other routers out there, it is totally worth it if you want to have high quality signal with outstanding range and power. I tried several routers before I finally bought this one. I had several dead spots in my ;house and everything I tried to remedy the problem just ended up costing me more money and poor results. I bought range extenders and even had Comcast provide me with a signal amplifier and still had dead spots and my house is not that big. Then I bought this router after hours of reading reviews and tech articles about it. I eliminated the two range extenders and even was able to return the signal amplifier to Comcast which I was paying a monthly rental charge on. When I got this router up and running, which was very simple and straight forward, I had a fantastic full signal on all my devices throughout the entire house. So now I stream Netflix, Amazon Prime programs, Hulu, and Vudu on all three tv's in the house as well as two Samsung tablets, two Samsung Note 5 cell phones, two laptop computers, an HP printer and even my door bell uses the wifi connection to tell me when someone is at the door even when I'm not home on a video and audio supported doorbell and motion activated  surveillance camera linked to my cell phone called Ring Inc. Anyway I have had no problems with weak signals anywhere in the house. When I turn onto my street when I'm coming home my phone picks up my home network 5 houses away. Its amazing and definitely worth every penny. Hope this info helps somebody out in the future when trying to find the right router.because you definitely will be amazed at how well this thing works.",

I am coming from a WNDR4500 netgear which provided great reliable service for several years. The setup of this router was very easy. The unit did a firmware update right off the bat. I run a 24 port switch out of this unit and I am using all 24 ports at this time. The laptop that I am using with the Netgear A6200 adapter is connecting at 600 plus. In the past I was getting Internet download speeds of 30-40 mbps. Depending on how close I am to the router I have obtained downloads above 150 mbps. Patched through the switch to my desktop I receive 190 mbps downloads. I have not had any drops to this point. I have this router on the second floor of our 2000 SQ Ft home and it is in the center of the house. I receive 5 bars at any location in the house. I was a little concerned about this based on the trouble that some have noted in reviews, but based on the workhorse in the WNDR4500 and my success with it, I gave this one a try. I love it to this point. I have a noticeable difference in my streaming through ROKU devices. I have Ipads, multiple laptops, Iphone, android phone and tablet. All are working great with this router with STRONG signal strength on each device. In my opinion, Netgear may have had some problems upon release, but they have gotten those worked out and have a great device with this X6. No remorse with this purchase and I would recommend.\n\nUPDATE: I took my laptop to my workshop behind the house today. It is about 30 feet behind my house and the laptop still had a very strong signal. I did a speedtest on my Internet connection and I had download speeds of 45 - 50. I had been able to connect with the WNDR4500, but with download speeds in the 15-20MBPS range.",

                "review_body": "I feel bad for changing my review, I really did love this router, I left my original review under this.\n\nAt first things went so well, fast Internet, uninterrupted wifi, but then it just stopped. Weak signal, I figured once again it had to do with the interference in my area, I ended up buying the X4 Extender, which made things worse. I bought another netgeat router and nothing. I ended up having to reboot it every single day, not kidding, every day, then I was never able to sign onto the extenders, then whenever I did a speed test it never showed my speed or it bounced in speed, I get 200mbps and it will show that some days and other days way less then that, and forget about the 2.4ghz, it was horrible. I was lucky to get 60mbps on it, the signal was so weak that it wouldn't reach the extender, before calling customer service I researched what to do, I changed channels, I changed every setting known to netgear routers, turned off qos and so on, also, and finally, did the so called 30 30 30 reset... nothing. Same thing.....\n\nFinally called customer service and they told me to do everything that I did before calling them and nothing, they claimed they had no idea but apparently I'm not the only one.\n\nI'm shocked how such an expensive product can really become so horrible to the point where I will never buy another netgear product ever again...\n\nI put my netgear products up for sale and bought the Google wifi three pack, and it was the best investment ever.... I've had them for over two weeks and have not had to change a channel or reboot the system once...\n\nShame on you netgear for one not having better customer service, 2, not trying hard to help your customers who payed hard earned money to buy your higher end products....\n\nI'm really not one to leave such negative feedback, but I assure you that I will never buy another product of yours again...\n\n-------------------------------------\nI bought the apple extreme AC router, in fact I had two of them, one was the main and the other was the extender. I own a large three bedroom condo and I was having problem getting WiFi through out the entire condo even with the extender. I was afraid to step away from the apple routers due to their software being easy to use. However, frustration overcame me with the slow WiFi especially having kids that have phones, tablets, game systems and so on. I read up on the X6 and had a great feeling about, I first contacted Netgear customer service to ask them the questions that I had and they were great with answering them and assured me that I was making the right choice. So I made the giant step and bought the X6 and was excited once I received it. To my amazement the software to set it up was very easy, and set up was a breeze. Just with the X6 alone I was able to get WiFi in the bedroom which is at the other end of the condo without issue.\n\nI was able to test the speed of the WiFi when everyone was home on the weekend, so all game systems were on, tablets were on, movies were being streamed and to my amazement no slow down in speed at all. The QOS option really works, I placed the apple TV and the Fire TV on the 5ghz band and for the first time I was able to stream full HD without any issues or slow downs or lag.\n\nThe X6 completely blew away the Apple Extreme and I am more than happy with this unit.\n\nThank you",

                "review_body": "Let me be clear, the 2 star rating is for Amazon, they sent me a used Netgear Nighthawk X6 router. The router itself is definitily a 5 star! Installation went smooth, easiest router I ever installed. The Netgear Genie software installed the new firmware and I was off and running. After I got over my initial amazement, I went to register the router with the manufacturer.\n\nThis is when everything went wrong! After entering the serial number for registration, a message was returned that the  router was already registered by someone else. The exact message read \"This Serial number has already been registered in our system by a support representative\". The registration process would not allow me to continue, so I could not register the product under my name. I chatted online with Netgear support  personnel and they informed me the unit had already been registered and was a used unit. This came as a big surprise to me, so I reported the problem to Amazon. To their credit, they agreed to ship me a replacement unit.\n\nBuyer beware, make sure you register your router to insure you have a new unit.\n\nUpdate: June 4, 2015.\nI hve had the new router for several weeks now and couldn't be happier. It works great. Once I got the replacement router I did have a small problem at first where I would lose my connection every couple of days and when my PC went into sleep mode. After checking with the Netgear, they recommended verifying I had the latest driver. I had the latest driver according to Microsoft Auto Update, but that turned out to be an outdated driver. I went to Intel's website and found there was in fact a later driver for my PC. Downloaded the newer Intel driver and everything has been working great since. You cannot assume you have the latest drivers if you only count on Microsofts Updates, they only get the updates the vendors send them, I guess in my case the newer driver was overlooked. As I said before, everything is working great with fantastic range and throughput. YOU JUST  HAVE TO MAKE SURE YOU ARE GETTING A NEW UNIT!",

                "review_body": "Tri-band AC router and can make any USB printer an Airprint printer. Sounds like a winner, right? Nope!\n\nThe NETGEAR Nighthawk X6 AC3200 Tri-Band Wi-Fi Router (R8000) didn't do what I wanted.\n\nDay 1. Easy to easy up, I give it that. Setup in less than 5 minutes to my Verizon FiOS advanced Router (Actiontec router MI424WR) as an access point, but I noticed that I could not hook my Samsung CLP-550N printer to it (never showed on my R8000 devices). Downloading from my TiVo to my iphone took 5-6 times as long. I had to leave my TiVo on the Actiontec router because it was MoCA (Multimedia over Cable Alliance) connection or coax. I email both the amazon@netgear.com support (still no response) and NetGear support.\n\nThe couple of days. Netgear support just send me standard tech documents. I had better time troubleshoot myself. I found out that I had to use a Static IP for my printer that my Actiontec router provided since it was the DHCP server. It is weird, that the R8000 didn't get the IPs from the Actiontec like my other devices. When I did that, my printer showed up. Still though, doing IP based printing would not allow Airprint.\n\nA few days later, Netgear support moved up to level 2 and wanted to troubleshoot over the phone. Of course, when they were on the phone, the TiVo would download 1GB 1hr show in 16 minutes like it should (not the 1hr 45 minutes) I was getting earlier. So I had them focus on getting the Airprint working via USB. Tried both as an Access point and as a Router. It turns out that Norton Firewall was preventing NetGear USB control center from seeing my printer. When I turned off my firewall, it could see it. I still could not print from my iOS devices. I was also looking for firewall setting to turn off as I tried my myself to all UPnP Discovery traffic to run, but didn't help (Support still has gotten back to me on that).\n\nAnother couple of days, my TiVo download would be sporadic. Sometimes that 16min download or 1hr 45min download for 1GB. Also, just downloading 12MB for a game update would just run at 0.1MB per 5 seconds on a bad day.\n\nSupport asked me to make my USB printer the default printer and my iOS devices saw the printer. I was able to print from my iphone. I asked if I could have my computer off for it to work and they said that it would check on it. They came back with this:\n\n\"I just got the information. The computer should be powered up since the iPhone can only communicate to the printer through the computer with the Netgear Genie application. The iPhone cannot directly communicate through the printer since the latter is not Airprint compatible. It communicates through the Netgear Genie application installed on it and on the computer. To put simply, the computer with the Netgear Genie is the converter/translator between the iPhone and the printer.\"\n\nI wanted the R8000 be the one to do the translation and not my computer. This is not good to have my computer all the time, especially with my firewall down. Plus the sporadic speeds, makes this a return. My Actiontec router should probably be good enough.",

                "review_body": "Starting with the 4 stars as I just purchased and installed the Nighthawk.  It is larger than I thought it would be and looks like a crazy spaceship.  The antenna are pretty neat being able to adjust them at various angles.  The set up was a super breeze and took me all of like 3 minutes.  The setup will highly depend on your home network though.  You can set a couple different SSIDs and while you can set the address and DHCP, the DHCP modifications are limited.  You can set reservations for devices already attached and set static reservations with a MAC address but no reserving part of the scope.  You can set the scope which helps a little.  The wireless signal is really good and all my home devices connected perfectly.  I also use it with Cox cable and they work perfectly together.  The options are good and so far, a nice little home based space ship.  Not sure it was worth $277.00 BUT only time will tell.\nUpdate 2/2/2015: so far, this little space ship has provided awesome connections for every device in my house.  I unbound the two 5g radios so I could provide AC to my media PC and it worked perfectly.  Every other device being A/AC/N/B/G or wired have all connected successfully.  I have two desktops and  a NAS connected via wired while everything else is wireless.  The wireless security is okay being able to use WPA2 however, there is no built in firewall.  I would like to be able to block ingress and egress but the security is limited.  You can block some sites or addresses but not very advanced.  Still not sure this is worth the almost $300.00 price tag BUT it is cool, looks awesome and provides great connections.\nUpdate 5/8/2015: So far this little UFO has been rock solid!  No more issues with duplicate addresses and every device has been able to connect successfully.  The throughput is pretty awesome as well.  The home media PC is connected wireless and can download a 6gb movie in just a few minutes, the home NAS is connected wired and stores all movies/TV shows and also plays perfectly.  Great connections, wish there was a built in firewall.\nUpdate 2/22/16:\nStarted seeing issues with duplicate addresses being provided via DHCP.  Unable to set reservations for various wireless and now seeing internet drops.  A recent firmware update may be part of this but the issues started before the upgrade.  Very disappointing especially for the cost and design.  May contact Netgear to check in possible solutions.\nUpdate: 5/20/16\nUnfortunately, I will be replacing this with a 5300, most likely ASUS.  While all wireless devices connect fine, the biggest issue is streaming media.  For the longest time I thought the issue was my NAS or even corrupt files but turns out its the wireless.  Tablets and such are more forgiving but not so with movies or TV shows.  I found the issue with a wireless sniffer and doing large file transfers.  There is some interference at times however, even with what looks to be no interference I get drastically random speeds which causes media to play poorly or not at all.  No wonder Kodi had issues.  Sooo very disappointed....",

                "review_body": "I used to be a geek...a few years have passed and the technology changes have left me way behind.  When my 3rd wireless router failed, I decided to buy \"the best\". I hate setting up our home network because the amount of devices needing a wireless connection have tripled.  We have a 15 MB connection but wirelessly could never get above 3 MB towards the end of each routers' life (and remember 3-4 devices share that 3 MB if we're all using our iPads in the evening).  A lot of research later, plus a few geek-friend recommendations, I purchased NETGEAR Nighthawk X6.  Spending that much on a router after the last 3 have bit the dust after only a year (each) was risky.  I decided to protect that risk by also buying a UPS so I could reduce the slow death that could be caused by voltage fluctuations. The router arrived quickly and with dread  I looked for the 2-inch thick installation manual - but found only a tri-fold pamphlet with a few added pages.  I looked for the installation CD...nothing.  I told my husband right there and then that this would probably be an all-night set up.  Imagine my surprise when I systematically followed the EASY instructions and the router essentially set up itself.  I answered a few questions via my browser and it was set up.  Problem was....I had 3 MB wireless connection to my tablets and 4 MB hard wired into the router for the desktop.  Hmmm....something wasn't right.  I started over.  Same problem.  I did some online research and didn't find a solution.  I sat staring at the router and saw a blink to my left. It was the older router in the corner that I didn't disconnect from the power. Since the old router was running when I connected the new router, the new router assumed an \"Access Point\" delivery status. I started over after unplugging the old router.  TA DA!  Easy set up and it worked perfectly.  Human error...sometimes we are the problem.  I'll get into the advanced set up options at a later date but I love the parental control options.",

We have a Roku, 4 Apple TVs, 6 iPhones, 4 iPads, two Android tablets, two Mac desktops, three Mac laptops, 3 Windows laptops, an Xbox One, two Xbox 360s, a Wii U, and a Playstation 4, all connected to the internet.  I have seen as many as 30 concurrently connected devices at one point.\n\nPreviously I had an ASUS RT router with 4 radios.  It absolutely buckled under this insane load.  Late at night when I was the only user, performance was great, but mid-evening everyone had major issues.  With this Netgear X6, I get fast speed and no buffering of Netflix no matter what's going on in our house.\n\nI've had no stability issues at all.  It's never stopped working or required rebooting, something that every router I've had for the last 15 years has needed from time to time.\n\nAs to parental controls, it relies on two approaches.  You can block specific domains on the router itself, and you can force all DNS queries through OpenDNS.org which gives you excellent granularity.  My router even emails me a summary every day of every site that anyone in my house visited so I can make sure the usage is appropriate.\n\nI could not be happier with this router.\n\nUpdate: Dec 2015 - after a year, this router is going strong.

                "review_body": "Well, more like a 4.5.  I wanted a router with a bit longer 5ghz range as I had a D6200 in back of my AT&T uverse, and the 5ghz signal was iffy in my room like 35ft away from the router.  This R8000 seem to be the latest with all the bells and whistles.  They touted long range with 6 antennas.  The -.5 is for the antennas.  For 299 retail you'd expect a little more quality.  You pull the antennas up and they feel like they're just gonna break off, very flexy flimsy feeling, but no problems once they're in place.  Not sure if they are helping or not yet, haven't had time to adjust them, they will stay put at 45 degrees and 90.  The router itself has like a whole line of leds on top which I don't know what they all are for, but it's bright.  You can thankfully turn them off in the setup.  The setup is identical to any other netgear router, so it was easy.  You can keep the 2 - 5ghz signals separate with 2 different ssid's, or combine them which I did using one ssid.  I didn't see much difference either way as the netgear seemed to divide up the online devices between the two, so I just let netgear do it instead of me having to put in a new ssid for half my devices.  So setup, I was up in less then 30 minutes, since I had a netgear already.  I updated the firmware and seems pretty stable.  Well for the 2 days I had it so far, it's been rock steady.  All my devices are at the same IP's so I know it hasn't rebooted as one of my devices is on an access point with dhcp built in and that always changes when the router reboots.  So far it's been pretty good.  All my devices have the 5 wireless bars and connections excellent throughout my smaller house.  I was only getting 2 bars in my bedroom with the D6200, so it's a little better then 2x the D6200.  I haven't tested my tablet outside, but that will be the next test.  I will post any negatives I find as I work with this, but so far it's a straight forward design and tried and true setup interface that's pretty easy to setup.  If you have an RG3800 and need info on how,  post a msg, i'll try to explain it.  Oh and I was connecting at low 200's Mbps with an AC1200 adapter,  but now it's always 650Mbps and above in my room,  any closer and it always connects at the AC1200 speed which is 867Mbps.  And the rest you can get from specs online, basically on/off button, usb 2 and 3,  4 Ethernet gigabit ports, 1 wan.\n\nUpdate: So far had it about a week and it's been working great.  I have my security cams forwarded with upnp on with no problems now.  Everything is working as it should.  I was a linksys fan, but this is working great for me.  Oh and it does have guest access too, but i have mine all turned off, two SSID's is plenty enough.  will put a network hard drive on next, will report if i have any difficulties.\n\nUpdate:  Worked great til i loaded latest krack firmware fix,  would not come back after reboot.  Routers dead now tried resetting, no luck.  Down to one star.  Its iut of warranty period so im screwed.",

                "review_body": "Previously, I had a Netgear AC1900 (R7000) and we enjoyed that AC wireless router. We gave this R7000 to our friend last week because he wants to upgrade from an N900 router. It worked for both of us since he was able to help another friend who needed a router. Thus, last week, it led me to read the reviews for this Netgear AC3200 (R8000). I am familiar with Netgear wireless routers and the Netgear Genie app so it was not difficult for me to decide which router to buy. Additionally, if you have many devices that you have to connect to your wireless router at any given time, it was easy for me to choose this product. Set-up was easy reference the Netgear instruction manual and my ISP set-up instructions (through the website). Also, after the set-up, I have upgraded the router to the latest firmware. Today (after a week's use), everything is still working fine. No issues (knock-on-wood) noted.  This product is a bit pricey but you can take advantage of the Amazon Store Card which gives you 6 mos. 0% interest (as of 05/05/2015).\n\nOverall, this is a very good product. I would highly recommend this Netgear wireless router to those who have so many devices at home (to include your friends visiting you and wanted to connect as well). May I add; connect most of your devices (if capable) to the 5 Ghz band. If you have slow wireless adapters on your PC, laptops, etc., you can avail / buy the wireless AC USB adapter which will definitely improve the device connection speed to your router.\n\nLastly, I had an opportunity to contact Netgear Tech Support several months back in relation technical issues on my R7000 router. This has something to do with my tinkering / experimenting on my router and another device which led to errors on my wireless connection. I was calling them several times and was speaking to different personnel  since the problem was solved every  time but it re-appeared again afterwards. In the end, we found the culprit which was on my side of the connection. They were very helpful and knowledgeable to my queries. Thus, my experience with them this year is very good and highly commendable.",

I live with three other people that use this router all day for gaming, streaming, and basic web access (5-6 computers, 3-4 gaming consoles, 4 phones, 1 wireless printer). I pay for business class internet so speed is a BIG concern for me. My place is one story with 4 bed, good sized living room and kitchen.\n\nThe Good:\n1. Super fast, no connection problems. When directly next to the router speedtest.net resulted in about 120Mbps hardwired and wireless (i know right?!) This *just* shows this router's wireless can deliver hardwired speeds on most home networks\n****Your actual speed will vary depending on your ISP, I pay for very fast internet through Comcast)****\n2. The VPN client is also a nice feature, most of the time you have to flash aftermarket router firmware or set up a VPN client on your network.\n3. Management is super easy for the less experienced user (assuming the Netgear Genie doesn't crash on you - see below), and the network was up within seconds.\n4. Definitely a looker, gets a lot of comments (mostly \"what is that?!\") but i think it looks super cool.\n5. You can flip a switch to turn off all status lights (except power) so they don't light up your room at night.\n\nThe not so Good:\n1. Sometimes apps hang on the iPhone but that may just be the phones fault, I might investigate further but not really a huge issue.\n2. The Netgear Genie App for iPhone is very nice. However the desktop version of the Netgear Genie just crashed constantly (Win 7 Pro x64), and I had to configure the router old school through the browser (which i would have done anyway).\n3. Antennae feel flimsy, but i don't move them much so it hasn't been a problem.\n\nFeel free to ask me any questions about this product.\n-Chris",

I get a message back saying it is not there. It lights up and looks pretty. Tried everything on the boards and no luck. Call Netgear service and asked why if I try to connect a new devise by pressing the WPS button, I cannot connect any device. They read back to me the exact procedure I used at which point I explained again, that is what I did and it did not work. He asked me if the lights on the devise were white. I said yes. He said that indicated it is not a hardware issue so I would have to pay for phone service. I am not an expert but I asked him why is me pressing the button on the device and it doesn\u2019t work is not a hardware issue? He was unable to help me. He again tried to sell me service and I said no. I told him I need to go. He said before you go I need to give you your service number. He gave me the same number I had to read off to him three times at which point I told him that and he started laughing. At that point I hung up.\nUPDATE 02 April 15: NETGEAR BAIT AND SWITCH BEWARE  SHAME ON YOU NETGEAR\nThis is directly from the web page at Amazon:\n\u201cWarranty Information: This product comes with a 1 year warranty\u201d\nBEWARE: THIS IS NOT TRUE\nIt actually comes with a 90 day warranty for software and 1 year warranty for hardware. The problem I had was everything seems to be a software issue and they won\u2019t tell you even when you ask a very specific question as I did if this type of issues is hardware or software. Several times during our conversation I was asked to purchase their addition service plan for them to answer my questions and resolve my issues. Towards the end they did state that if the issue did turn out to be a hardware issue I could request a refund of the money I paid for the service. Again I told them I wasn\u2019t interested because I already had an extra warranty with a third party vendor so if my issue wasn\u2019t covered I would use them.\nIn fairness to Netgear, it seems they farm out their customer service to people who are reading from a book and do not have the expertise to verify from the script. A lot of companies now do this. From my view the main drive for the two CS people who were helping me was to upsell me to their extra cost service plan\nEventually I did resolve my issue. In my case I tried to reset unit per page 166 which is hold reset in for 7 seconds. I did this on three separate occasions and you do see the led\u2019s change and it appears the unit resets but the unit did not work. After doing a lot of reading and discussing the issue with a knowable friend, I decided to hold the reset button in for 30 seconds. It shut down, rebooted and all is well and working now. Only Netgear can tell us if there is a difference between a 7 second and 30 second reset. I also have to be aware that maybe my 7 seconds and their 7 seconds are not the same. I did not use a timer. I am trying to be fair. I do want to thank Netgear for offering to help after I posted my complaint on line. I used Square Trade for my service warranty and I highly recommend you buy an extra service plan.\nThis is the best router I have ever used and highly recommend it with an extra warranty plan.\nI can only hope at some point someone starts a class action suit due to the false advertising or Netgear starts honoring what the write on line. Good luck to all, jim",

                "review_body": "I don't give out 5 star reviews easily. I did a lot of research before choosing this router. I read some negative reviews and complaints that the price was too high, but those all applied to the router when it was originally released. Since it's release almost 2 years ago, Netgear has made several significant updates to the firmware and the price has dropped from most places by about $40.\n\nI've been using Linksys routers since my very first one, a WRT54G. That was such a good router that I just kept buying other Linksys routers. However, the newer routers were not as well made and did not work as reliably as the WRT54G. My last Linksys router was the e4200 and I had constant problems with dropped wifi signals and random router reboots. I finally felt i just had to get something better.\n\nOur family had become very wifi dependent and i needed a router that could handle all the devices we were using. We had ended up with an iMac and HP color laserjet connected to a router by ethernet, and on WiFi we had 2 laptops, 2 Amazon Fire TVs, 2 iPads, an Apple TV, 2 Samsung phones and a Tivo. Lots of video streaming and data usage going on all the time. We have a 100Mbps internet connection from Comcast that is more than enough bandwidth, but our linksys e4200 router just couldn't handle all the devices well and the coverage didn't reach into our far bedroom very well..\n\nI read a lot of reviews and comparisons of routers before finally settling on the Nighthawk X6. The difference it makes to our home network is more than dramatic to the drop outs and pauses we had when watching Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, Hulu or Sling TV. We don't have any coverage problems anymore anywhere. I'm tempted to call it miraculous. The set up was easy and the smart connect and beamforming features working through 3 transmitters are able to handle all our devices. The price was not too high when you consider that it has solved all our problems regarding being able to use all our devices without any problems and the ability to finally watch movies on Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu and Sling TV with NO problems at all. I am a cordcutter - i should have mentioned that earlier - so we depend on those services for watching shows and movies. Our Tivo (bought from Amazon) has an antenna for local TV so all our bases are covered.\n\nIf you have a similar amount of WiFi devices in your home, i can heartily recommend this router.",

                "review_body": "Update: 9/6/15\nI initially looked forward to the Smart Connect feature that promised to make intelligent decisions for me on which 5G radio to use for various devices as they joined that common Smart Connect SSID. Problem is, the Smart Connect isn't very smart. I had 2 laptops with 55G radios and the router assigned them both the the stronger of the 2 signals (in this case the lower power lower channel range) and even when I began sharing a huge bunch of files between the 2 computers, the router was not smart enough to realize that these only 2 computers on the network should be placed on separate radios to maximize throughput (one was an N wireless device and the other an AC taboot). Instead, they both shared the single channel even though the upper channel set was there unused and in good signal strength range. The fix for me was to simply skip the Smart connect and manually name each band and make smart decisions on my own. Here is hoping NetGear makes Smart Connect smarter via future firmware upgrades.\n\nOriginal review:\nI just moved from a NetGear R7000 as I was noticing that my house of about 12 WI-FI devices was pushing the limits of the 2.4 band and giving me less than optimal download speeds. The dual 5G bands on the R8000 allowed me to place additional devices on the higher speed 5GHz bands and with 2 channels, my main laptops are on completely different channels thus maxing throughput.\n\nThis device as so easy to set up (nearly identical to the R7000. I am delighted with the range which seems very similar to the R7000 on both bands. No regrets on this purchase.\nI also compliment Netgear for creating a web interface that is screen reader accessible. This means blind people like myself have no problem adjusting all the features of this router via the web interface. The Linksys smart models were about impossible to use for blind people with a screen reader thus taking that model out of consideration for me.\nFinally, I considered the Asus for a while but ultimately chose this model as it still runs on 12 VDC as opposed to ASUS 19 VDC which meant I could use a battery backed 12 VDC power supply to keep the router running during power outages.\nAll in all, I am very happy with the Netgear R8000 and find it to fully cover my entire 2,600 sq. ft. home even though the router is located in the basement of my 2 story house.",

                "review_body": "If you get entirely annoyed when your network is not working well, and you have dropouts and buffering even though your bandwidth should support it then you need a new plan for wireless.I spent the last several years and plenty of cash to figure out the best combination of devices, that is the easiest plug-n-play solution. It's expensive, but it's stable, can handle a s***load of devices and can stream HD Homerun prime in HD easily throughout a 3300 sqft house (3 floors). Best of all this is the easiest set-up and least configuration (the QOS is figured out by the router- don't have to mess with setting it up) I have ever done. The main router on the main floor is NETGEAR R8000-100NAS Nighthawk X6 AC3200 Tri-Band Gigabit Wireless Router the extender I use in the basement is (don't use the Amped wireless router though- it's junk):\nAmped wireless REA20 High Power 700mW Dual Band AC Wi-Fi Range Extender $170.\n\nThis router is my dream come true. It handles all the QOS stuff perfectly without me having to configure anything. It's stable , and no more issues with IP conflicts, no more drops and limited connectivity issues like I had with that over-priced under performing Amped wireless RTA15 router.\n\nLook this is a lot of jack to throw down, and I don't think everyone needs this. This is basically for people that have limited network knowledge (and patience), lots of devices, and the need to stream high bandwidth over a relatively large area with few hiccups. I just know after several years experimenting with different set-ups this is the only combination I have found that works for me on all fronts consistently and is stable.\n\nupdate 05/25/2016- I began having issues with my router, after going back and forth with firmwares, I could not understand how I was getting download speeds from 5Mbps to 50Mbps (video streaming would stutter), upload speed of 1Mbps out of the router, but plugged straight into the modem I was consistently getting  a download speed of 90Mbps and an upload of 12Mbps. Once I turned that stupid QOS setting off, everything worked fine and the download/upload speeds matched what was coming out of the modem. The QOS setting in theory is a great idea, unfortunately the router works way better without it. Even considering the fact that I have 4 phones, 8 tablets, 1 Sony dash, 8 PC's,3 laptops, Ooma Voip, Roku, 2 smart TV's, and a Amazon Fire box all hooked up simulataneously, the QOS functionality did way more harm than good. Bottom line is turn the QOS OFF!",

                "review_body": "Returned. We wanted to love this router but it  stopped working in less than 2 weeks. We bit the bullet and purchased the Eero Pro Tri Band Mesh router system. So far so good. iPhone 12 is switching seamlessly.  Download speeds are even better than the Netgear. All devices are connecting well.\n\nInitial Review Date: 03/27/01\n\nReplaced our AirPort Extreme. I was hesitant to do so as Apple product users, but the Extreme just can\u2019t handle multiple smart devices and plugs anymore. I did a lot of research and the routers Apple offers just didn\u2019t pass the review muster.\n\nFirst of all my house is small. Just under 1000 sq ft but we are in our yard quite a bit so we needed an additional 500-1000sq ft reach without dealing with a Mesh system. iPhones are notoriously finicky with Mesh systems often connecting to nodes farther away so I wanted to steer clear from those. I needed a router that had range front a central point in our home. Enter the Netgear Nighthawk X6 AC2300 Tri Band Router. We get amazingly fast speeds inside and out. 300bps XFINITY service. We are clocking speeds of 348bps inside and 200bps in our outside yard. Minimal to no latency or hang even outside. All devices connected and running like fire. Even our Printer, which had connectivity issues with the Extreme connected instantly. Streaming is the best we\u2019ve ever had. Overall, first day of use we are extremely satisfied.\n\nSetup: As with most new modems plug and play setup is not like the old days. The router needed some love out of the box to get up and running. Here\u2019s what worked for us with tech supports help:\n\n-Downloaded the Nighthawk app on my iPhone\n\n-The QR code on the box wasn\u2019t printed in high quality so my iPhone 12 couldn\u2019t read the code so I selected manual setup. The router comes with a network and password on the label. Started the manual setup and followed the prompts.\n\nHint: On initial setup just use the default Netgear network ID and password (we changed ours to our network ID and password when it prompted us to and the setup got stuck). We ended up resetting router to factory default which is a breeze and started over. We later realized the modem needed to update its firmware. The app updated the routers firmware but told us it failed. (Don\u2019t worry. It didn\u2019t).\n\nRouter resets itself and it\u2019s updated. Setup will get stuck again. Don\u2019t sweat it. Performed a factory reset again just to give the router a clean startup with new firmware. Bam. That did the trick. Tech Support suggested to delete Nighthawk app from iPhone and reinstall after firmware update and let the app sign back in. Be patient. Let the app recognize the router and the screen will change automatically. Don\u2019t click Connect Anywhere on initial setup screen. It will bog down the setup. Let the app do its thing. The app will check for firmware update and won\u2019t find one and then the app will complete the setup.\n\nOnce we allowed the app to setup properly we then went into our Wifi Settings on the app and changed our Network Name and password to our original one which all our devices are connected to. It updated and worked perfectly.\n\nWe are plug and play peeps so we enabled Smart Connect to let the router handle traffic for us. I don\u2019t want to have to assign bands to devices.\n\nThe router will need some attention to get up and running initially but once you work through the firmware update and reset it will work like a charm.",

To be fair, unlike some, I didn't but 2-3 similar models from different manufacturers so I can't compare them.  However, this unit, along with the Netgear Range Extender AC1900, have been working fantastically for my video streaming and wireless computing.  (As a side note, its truly amazing to see just how many devices in your house are actually networked)\n\nOther reviewers have written extensively about the feature set and compared it to the competition.  I really can't do a better job than them.  However, I can offer my own observations:\n\nThe unit is on 24x7 and services probably a dozen \"always on\" wireless devices in the house (TVs, game systems, Dish/Joeys, etc.).  Its warm, but not hot.  I have no issues connecting to it or maintaining a connection.  The interface is easy to use but does offer advanced settings for people who know what they're doing (the advanced settings are still fairly simplistic but you can fine tune some of the options if you wish).\n\nRight now, the only issue I have is that my Apple TV will NOT wake my computer when I go to browse my movies or TV shows from iTunes.  Yes, I know that Apple has had issues with Bonjour and the Bonjour proxy service in recent OS X updates but this isn't it.  In fact, when upgrading from my previous unit to this one, the problem started immediately.  If I walk into the other room and wake my Mac and go back to the Apple TV, I'm fine and everything is good.  I'm nearly 100% positive that the problem lies with this router since nothing else was changed between the swap out.\n\nThe above is the only reason I took off a star.  The exercise isn't going to kill me but it is annoying.  Other than that, its a great unit.",

                "review_body": "I don't usually do reviews years after purchase, but I wanted to share in case you were debating whether to purchase it. I bought the NETGEAR Nighthawk X6 Smart WiFi Router (R8000) - AC3200 Tri-band in 2017, and it has been operating since then, finally breaking down (power issue) a few days ago. I have to say, for ~250 dollars it did not hold up to my expectations, and with the inability to reach out to tech support, I do have to echo a lot of the negative reviews related to support. I found the Netgear community the only venue outside of self troubleshooting, albeit it required searching a bit. Still, the community seemed to be wanting to help, contrary to the expectations of the vendor from a customer.\n\nAs a result, I am not going to be purchasing any more Netgear equipment, even if I have to pay extra not to do so.\n\nOutside of that, as it relates to utilization, it is reasonably configurable but limited in non-standard or advanced functions. I did not take the DD-WRT route, which i am regretting now. While the nighthawk app is a nice touch, it does not have the same functionality as the web interface, and the application for Windows was different as well. I find it interesting that all three give you different capabilities -- I found most use via the phone app; however, initial setup and configuration, as well as tweaking advanced functions required the web interface.\n\nAs it relates to functionality, while it did provide various options, my expectations were not met, it had many quirks via the web interface, and any significant adjustments required cycle-timing which were sub-par. The app did not provide anything bar the basics, and i am not sure what they made the Windows program for?\n\nIf you want something decent in terms of ~speed (based on 2017 standards) out of the box, it is not bad, but at $250, it is not worth it, as there are many other options out there now, which are far better. I am not sure if i could say that back in 2017, but in 2020 it should not even be on your list at that price.\n\nOverall I cannot recommend this router for ~$250, and if we throw in support into the mix, i warn you using Milton and the red stapler.",

                "review_body": "Wow. after YEARS of fighting weak Wifi (really, YEARS).  Spending stupid amounts of money on repeaters and becoming a near expert on antenna tech, I had given up on my house.  I had two bids in hand for a couple thousand bucks to hard wire in enough Cat 6 points to ensure high bandwidth to SEVERAL access points to supply signal to the different levels and locations I need Internet.  (The House ain't that grand, just several levels and I work at home and move around a lot.  It also has some mystery materials that seem resistant to signal.)\n\nToday FedEx brought me salvation.  The easiest, most bullet-proof set-up that I've ever used.  30 minutes start to finish to change out an old installation and be writing this review on hi band AC.  Here's the best part.  I am sittiing RIGHT NOW at the furtherest point in my house from the router with LESS THAN 5% (waaay less) fall off from HARDWIRED speed UP AND DOWN and I am using a lap top with no augmentation.  (That means that I don't have a little USB dongle on my laptop to boast single.)  Specifically, my download speed is over 55 and my upload is over 12 (Mbps).  Now your area may have greater or less speed than mine but my AT THE PLUG speed on ethernet is less than 5% higher tested in realtime.\n\nSo, to tell you the truth.  I have always hated Netgear.  When a client put in one of their low end routers months ago, I groaned.  Now, I'm here to say the R8000 (AKA AC3200) - JUST SCREAMS.  And it is equally MAC friendly, has a nice iphone app and serves as an iTunes server.\n\nI think it will be a while before anything beats this.  Wow.  (Again, from the time FedEx dropped the box until the period in this sentence hit was barely an hour - it's that easy.)",

                "review_body": "First off, thank you all for your well thought out reviews.  I was first going to purchase from another manufacturer but became concerned over issues many appeared to be having.  After reading through the reviews here, it seemed clear this was a better bet.\n\nMoved to a new home and due to inability to hard wire directly in to router due to logistics, needed to find a powerful and long range device.  What I mean is that while in prior home I used the wireless, I was able to plug more devices directly in to it such as my business PC, Television, DVD/CD player, etc;  In the new place, logistics prevent me from doing that due to proximity of each room.\n\nMy home is 2200 sqft.  My office is on one end of the house, which is where I must have the modem and wireless router.  I am pleased to report the router working perfectly and reaching all areas of my home with a strong signal.  I have many (over 10) devices with access to the wireless router and all are performing perfectly.\n\nThe setup was simple.  I updated the software and changed the names of the bands and passwords .  Was easy as pie.\n\nThank you again reviewers and Netgear for providing an excellent wireless router.\n\nEDIT:  January 12, 2015:  Just a few days later the cheap power supply died.  Phoned Tech Support and they suggested I return it and obtain a new one.  They agreed it was the power line.  Received the new one quickly (Thanks Amazon) and now working again.  Router rocks, but why any company would select a cheap power supply made in China for a router of this level is insulting.  Tempted to take 2-stars off, but since router is great and was a minor inconvenience, only subtracted 1-star.  PS:  Went back to my Linksys 4500 and the signal around my home was 1/2 the strength of the AC3200.  Please Netgear, rethink the few dollar savings and give customers a more reliable power cord.",

                "review_body": "Awesome router.  I have Verizon FIOS 50/50 Mbs speed.  The Verizon router I have is about 8 years old and all of my devices are WiFi.  I have 2 Asus laptops, a wireless printer, 2 Samsung Note 4s, PS4 and Chromecast.  The Verizon router WiFi was not good in range so I purchased a Netgear N600.  It was ok.  The only devices I have that support 5 GHz are the phones.  The 5 GHz on the N600 was only good in the upstairs of the house.  The network drops are in an office upstairs.  The house is 2300 square feet.  Ultimately I left the phone on 2.4 GHz because the 5 GHz was unable downstairs..  In the downstairs where most of my devices are I world get typical speeds from speed test of around 25 Mbs using the 2.4 GHz.  It was very frustrating not getting the speed I'm paying for because of the Netgear N600.  Fast forward a year.  I was thinking of dropping some physical cables through the house but wanted to try an upgraded router first.  I did much research and decided on this claw looking router.  Setup was a breeze.  I have Windows 10 and had no issues.  Now on the phones which have 802.11ac I get about 58/58 Mbs with the same speed test through out the whole house.  Link speeds upstairs are around 860 Mbs and downstairs around 120 - 300 depending where I am.  I'm pretty much the only house around with 5 Ghz signals so the channels are wide open.  I'm so impressed with this router I decided to buy the Netgear AC1200 wireless adapter for both laptops.  These adapters support 802.11ac.  I got one today and am even more impressed with the performance in my laptops.  Performance and signal is top notch.  I'll do a review of the adapter shortly.\n\nHighly recommend.  Although there really isn't much use for the super high speed of 802.11ac for my home other than file transfers and backups I'm sure more electronics will begin to support this in the future.  So with my phones and laptops equipped with these purchased I can get hard wired speeds anywhere in my house.\n\nIn the future I'll probably drop some Cat 6a.  The Cat 6a isn't much more expensive than Cat 5 so why not.  Then I can reposition the router to a better location closer to my main devices but for now I am amazed.\n\nI'm no slouch when it comes to electronics.  Buy this.",

                "review_body": "Hands down the best router that I myself have ever owned or used. I bought one of these for my mom's house after I finally convinced her to upgrade our Internet speed. Tri-Band routers hadn't been out for very long, I believe that at the time, this was one of 3 sold on Amazon. After researching Tri-Band I decided to go with the Nighthawk X6, which was a pricey $300 at the time, kind of a lot to spend on a router. But I figured it would be worth it if it could do all the things it said it could. I have yet to be disappointed with this router, it has awesome speed when connected wirelessly and even better speed when connected through a hard line. This router can handle many, many devices at once. But it is not just the number of devices connecting all at once, but also what those devices are doing over that connection. Things like Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Video, X-Box Live, etc. eat up ALOT of bandwidth, and that's if your only using one of those things by itself with nothing else at the same time. The fact that this router could handle 2 Smart TVs running Netflix while I was gaming through X-Box Live was very impressive to me. The wireless also had no problems reaching every room in that house(a two-story Cape). I loved this router so much that I had to get it again when my girlfriend and I had Internet installed in our apartment. My mom wanted me to take the one that I had left at her house when I moved out, because she knew how much I had spent on it, but I honestly would have felt bad taking it from her. Plus I got an absolutely awesome deal through Amazon when I bought this and a matching modem as a package. There is a newer, even more expensive version of the Nighthawk out right, but this thing has never let me down and I don't see it doing that anytime soon. It is also very easy to install, walking you through it step by step. If there is a negative thing to say about this router it is that I have found that most women(My Mom & My GF) think that this thing is either hideous or incredibly weird looking, Which can make it a tough sell to put out in the open where it will work the best. But both my brother and I find it cool looking. In the end I feel like it has definitely been worth the money I have spent on it(twice), $300 is a lot to spend on a wireless router. But if your Internet connection and speed is of top importance to you than this is hands down worth every penny.",

                "review_body": "This is my first ever customer review in many many years. This router was a replacement to a watch for XTM 22. I needed something that was easy to manage and did not require a degree in order to set up rules and routing information. This review is as of October25,2014 - The reasons for only three stars is because there is no real QOS as of the current firmware. Supposedly Netgear is redoing the QOS section. But until they actually come out with a true way to manage, I cannot in good conscience recommend this device.\n\nIt is unfortunate, because the main reason I bought this device was to set up some rules in the house. We have literally over 40 devices connected to the network. With seven people living in the household we all have iPhones iPads,  Apple TVs, desktop computers, Xbox consoles, and laptops that all connect to the network via both wired and wireless connections; we need a very high-level router to control all those. Oh and I have voice over IP as well - Home lines and a home office with two lines. - this device is handling the traffic with no issues. I am also very impressed with the range of the Wi-Fi. But with six antennas I was very hopeful that it would stretch out around the entire two story house and into the patio. - Which it does.\n\nPROS\n- The user interface is very easy to manage if you have a basic understanding of your network needs.\n- The range of the Wi-Fi is pretty incredible.\n- Seems to be handling multiple concurrent wireless users with no real issues.\n- Unit does not put out a lot of heat.\n- no fan noise or any nonsense either.\n-  The thing looks like a beast. When anyone sees it they think I know networking LOL!\n\nCONS\n- No real QOS management. Netgear rushed this to market before the firmware was complete IMHO\n- The pass-through speed does seem slightly slower than my old watch guard XTM22. The household complains that the access time to a webpage and load times seem a little bit slower. I'm thinking about changing the DNS servers to see if that clears up the issue\n- No logging. My old router allowed me to capture just about any traffic that was going through that router. And then easily creat rules based on traffic issues I saw. This device does not.\n- can not create time of day rules by Mac Address. This is a requirement with kids in the household.\n\nBOTTOM LINE\nI in fact do recommend this product, but I recommend you buy it in about six months or once Netgear has actually finished their firmware.",

I have 12 devices and all devices are connected at maximum speeds: I have two \"ac\" devices, connecting at 1.3Gbps I have eight \"n\" devices, connecting between 300 and 450Mbps, (depending on the devices' adapter capabilities,) and a couple of old \"g\" devices connecting at 54Gbps. - Theoretically this divides them up and will minimize collisions and bottlenecks, (IE an \"ac\" device will not have to wait for a \"g\" to finish before it can use the wireless network.)\n- Range: While the range on this doesn't blow me away, it is a good step up from my old \"n\" router (Linksys E3200.) At the farthest point of my house the wifi speed is still connecting at the maximum 450Mbps speed for my \"n\" devices.\n- Overall the setup was pretty easy, it only took about 30 minutes or so to get everything configured correctly and the firmware updated.\n - USB3 and USB2 attached storage ability, this is pretty useful!\n- VPN access.  Now I can access my attached usb3 hard drives anywhere in the world!\n\nCons\n- Price, it will probably come down right before the holidays.\n- Buggy firmware, When I set the two 5Ghz bands to \"smart connect\" one of the bands kept dropping out, (every 15 seconds or so.)  Once I configured the router to use the two bands with independent SSIDs then they worked fine. this will probably be fixed in a future firmware release.\n- Space, this thing has a big footprint\n- Not a big con, but I did have to update the drivers on two of my wireless n adapters to get them to work with this router.\n\nI would recommend the nighthawk X6 for an intermediate to advanced router user to use the full potential of this device. If you just want a router that is simple and functional without many extra functions, then there are much cheaper alternatives that will get the job done just as well.  But if you are going to take the time to take advantage of the usb3 (and usb2) storage, VPN and three bands of speed then this is a good buy.\nUnfortunately, because of the buggy firmware I can't recommend more than 3 stars at this time.",

                "review_body": "This review is for the AC3200 (R8000) Router.\n\nThe AC3200 Nighthawk is a solid router for a house with multiple users streaming and playing video games.\nPros:\n-The adaptive QoS works well though you cannot change application priority. It is hard set to give priority to gaming and streaming so it works well in a home but it may cause issues for a business. You can also set a device priority for QoS but it only kicks in when both devices are using the same application.\n\n-The OpenVPN and NoIP services built into the router work without issues. I can easily VPN back to my home network with both my Windows laptop and Android Phone.\n\n-There are three users that play a lot of Xbox. The NAT is always open for all of the consoles and there was a noticeable improvement regarding lag (adaptive QoS). DLNA media streaming works well; I have a thumbdrive with all of my music plugged into the router. Wireless range is good (1800 sqft house).\n\n-The router handles delegation of the 5GHz radios well. It put all of my AC band devices on one and my N band devices on the other.\n\n-Haven't really had to reboot it.\n\n-Real Time bandwidth usage and Application usage through the app (QoS has to be on)\n\n-Remote management via NETGEAR account using the app\n\nCONS:\n-The router takes a relatively long time to reboot.\n\n-Parental controls have issues. (1) the built in default parental controls are very vanilla. (2) the OpenDNS parental controls will not enable correctly on the router (known issue) and even if they did all a user has to do is change their DNS servers to get around them. (3) the Circle parental controls are awesome but there is a firmware bug that makes your routers speed drop to ~30Mbps down and ~6Mbps up every 6-8 hours (only time I had to reboot the router). It affects all devices and seems to be an issue with CPU utilization on the router when circle is enabled (known issue).\n\n-Genie App for the PC is clunky and looks like it is from 2002\n\n-Genie App for Android/Apple is better laid out but can be a little slow when getting information from the router.\n\n-Some settings cannot be changed from the Web GUI; only through the App (parental controls).",

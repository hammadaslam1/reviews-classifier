I took extra care trying to keep the shoe together. Then about after month 3 the entie reebok logo completly ripped off. Overall i'm very dissapointed with the shoe.\n\nPlease do not spend your money on this shoe. It has only cost me money and a waste of time.",

I have been using these almost a year now and they are still in great shape (I only wear them at the gym, nowhere else and not outside).

I have high arches and I really take into consideration about the negative effects running has and I try my best to take preventative measures against them.  What really enticed me to switch brands and purchase these shoes, besides the reputable brand ASICS is, was the fact that they had GEL cushioning. After receiving these shoes they felt really great and my first run in them was like running on air; pumped out a 7 minute mile.  After the 2nd run my calves really started to cramp up...  After ruling out dehydration, environmental factors, and substituting in orthodics I determined that these shoes were the cause of having to cut my runs short.  After further analysis of the shoe I realized that the heel was lifted slightly higher than my other running shoes.  ASICS are just not made for me.  I went and purchased some new Under Armour shoes and they just work GREAT!  I guess it's all about finding what brand best suites you.  Every company makes their shoes differently based on research, consensus, customer feedback, and goals.  Goodluck!",

The uppers are never a problem, something two other mainstream brands can experience.  FWIW I also use sorbothane material sole inserts removing the originals, but those are good for several years.

They are even better, if possible, and I love how great they feel new and used. The only reason I had to change shoes is because the technology in a shoe can only last for so long before it wears out. A lot of technology in these shoes- gel, insole, arch, etc. If you're looking for a high quality shoe- this is it. I highly recommend you try the shoe on or another Asics shoe in a store first.

I need to keep my gait square or else I'll spin out into the weeds fast.  In other words, I'm a case.  Can a shoe fix these problems?  Well, not completely - but the GEL-Kayano 17 gives massive support without weighing a ton.  Very comfortable shoe, too - I've extended my daily runs by 30%, and knocked almost a minute off my pace.  If you need support, this shoe is a cost-effective & very comfortable solution.  The asymmetric laces make me smile, too - not sure why, they just look a bit off-beat... Recommended - by an old guy with bad knees.  Will probably work wonders for runners who have fewer issues, too.",

I made the mistake to fall for the shiny Lunarglide 3.\nI know that when it comes to running shoes, verdicts are relative. One size doesn't fit all. Maybe those Lunarglide 3 are OK for some people, but for me, they made my Achilles pain reappear. I got that pain after finishing 3 pairs of Nike Vomero (2+,3 and 4) and one pair of Nike Pegasus 25. The pain became rather serious and I decided to switch to stability shoes, selecting the Kayano 16. Almost magically, the pain went away. After 680 miles a got a second pair. Everything was fine with my running.\n\nBut when I saw the additional stability advertised for the Nike Lunarglide 3, I gave them a try. Mistake! And not only because of the renewed Achilles pain, but also because after only 300 miles, their shiny sole vanished! Nice trick from Nike to make you visit their shops twice as often!\n\nI'm now back to the good old Kayano's and, knock on wood, my Achilles pain is gone, again! Magic!\nLet's see if their mileage will be as good as before.\n\nHappy Running to you all!",

I can say this is a great stability plus shoe. It helps you a lot with your training avoiding injuries because it is a well constructed shoe.\n\nI needed to replace my Kayano 16 in order to get a newer pair of shoes, therefore I decided to buy the Kayano 17 over the 18 because the price in Amazon is amazing and I also do not like to buy newer series of shoes before people test them well. I have run 4 times with my news Kayano (14 miles) and I can say they are so amazing like the previous models. They fit and feel really good in your foot.\n\nWhat I like most in Asics is they break in fast. This means you can put more miles on them faster than other brands which you need more time in order to feel them comfortable and avoid injuries.\n\nTry to get advantage of the price and buy them.

                "review_body": "When my old shoes wore out, I started shopping...\n\nPretty soon I was beginning to think updating my running shoes was like wearing underwear - I felt like I needed a new pair every day. One pair was too firm and hurt my shins. Another pair was too cushy and didn't support my pronation and my knee starting hurting. Another pair just was too tight and narrow. Another pair was way too wide and mushy. Fortunately, I have a good retailer that acceps a lot of returns - but I started to feel like no matter what I did I couldn't get a pair I'd end up keeping for a long time. I didn't want to keep dealing with returning to the store and figuring out yet another pair/brand/size/etc to try.\n\nNow I have these - and I was hesitant at first - buying online, never tried them on, and they're top-of-the-line pricepoint. I couldn't be happier. They are cushy enough my shins appreciate the extra cushioning. But true to their stated purpose, these are not cushioned shoes by design. They are stability (I think asics calls it structured cushioning or something) shoes and have the nice firm greyer foam called Duomax. My feet are comfy but don't roll and my knees don't hurt anymore either.\n\nSo don't get me wrong - these shoes won't be perfect for everyone. I'm a moderate overpronator and these are perfect for my build. YMMV.\n\nPlus they were available in this grey/gold color and have a cool look to them.",

                "review_body": "These are the best running shoes I've ever owned. I am 6'4 and 225 lbs and have always had a tough time finding shoes that are good for a guy my size. I've also had two knee surgeries, on the same knee, and no matter what kind of shoes I've had previously, I would always start getting sore in my knee around mile 2; and the pain would usually last after the run as well. Being a professional firefighter, it's pretty essential that I run to stay healthy and maintain a certain level of endurance that you can really only get from running. So I finally went to a running store looking for a cushion shoe to take the load off of my knees. They quickly informed my that at my size, I need a stability shoe (like this one) to get the support and cushioning that I need. I was a little apprehensive, but I bought them anyway. All I can tell you is they are amazing! I am never sore in my knees and because of that, I can routinely run 5 miles without ever having a problem. I recently bought a second pair of these for my brother, who is a built a lot like me and is also a firefighter. He can't say enough about how great they have been for him. These shoes really are awesome, especially at this price. I ordered these from Runner's World through Amazon and they were here very quickly! Runner's World also called to make sure they came correctly and made a very good effort for customer service. I couldn't be happier with the product or the companies involved!",

                "review_body": "My first Kayano 17 impressions over the Nimbus 12:\n- slightly more substantial feel\n- more heel strike cushion\n- more stability\n- narrower toe box 'feel' (not actually narrower. I'll explain below)\n\nI purchased and compared Kayano 17 to the Nimbus 12 for use primarily as walking/hiking shoes. Both feel great on my feet, but the Kayano 17's have a slight edge in stability as well as having a bit more heel cushioning - I did a simple heel walk and heel bounce test. Toe padding seems about equal. For this I did toe bounces for 30 seconds with each pair. Overall I'd say I notice the Kayano's on my feet more, whereas the Nimbus feel, well, more nimble, more like a 'pillow' as another review said of the Nimbus. Make no mistake; the Kayano's are super comfortable. Different shoes for different people, essentially. I don't know the actual weight difference between these, but holding them I'd say very little; it's more the perception while wearing them that the Nimbus's are lighter, even though they probably aren't, or aren't by much.\n\nKayano's toe box 'feel' is a tad narrower than the roomier-feeling Nimbus toe box (both pair are 7.5 men's; medium \"D\" width); so the Nimbus's allow my toes to expand when striking first with my toes (hiking steep uphills, running up steps, etc.). I think this has to do with the Nimbus meshing; it's lighter and stretchier, which may give the Nimbus a slight advantage during hot summer months when feet tend to swell, or for people with wider feet that aren't quite wide enough to justify going to the next width size up. Too much room risks blistering and/or less stability; too little crams the toes together.\n\nSpeaking of stability, both seem to include the same ASICS technologies, but the Kayano's fare a bit better here. I tested this simply by holding the heel part and the widest part of the shoe and gently trying to twist it. Wearing them also seems to give the nod to the Kayano's. Venturing a guess, reasons might include a slightly beefier last, higher heel shank and different lace patterns; whereas Nimbus laces follow a slight curve from tongue to toe, Kayano's use the more traditional straight-line lace pattern.\n\nBoth shoes have nice heel-to-toe roll. Some sneakers, even those built on a curved last, inevitably give that 'slap' when the toe strikes. Both these shoes employ curved lasts. I compared the lasts by visual inspection and by rolling opposite sneaks bottom to bottom. Visually speaking, their shape (width/length/curve) appear nearly identical; only the tread looks different. the Kayano heel shank is noticeably higher which as I said probably contributes to stability.  Of course, I can't speak for how their internals are constructed.\n\nI value feet health since I *love to walk and want the best for all my joints above my feet, so the $50 difference (depending on which color/size you get) between these shoes  counts towards 'healthy foot insurance.' Since I'll use these as my everyday shoes, and for for walking two miles in the forest a few times each week, I'll probably replace them within a year; even the most expensive sneaker becomes a liability as they begin to deform and flatten over time.\n\nYes, the Nimbus 12 is really a great choice (and cheaper), but for the reasons above, the Kayano 17 running shoe is my choice.\n\nHappy shopping :)",

I ordered these shoes to see if he could get some relief and get back to his treadmill walking.  He was very impressed with the cushioning these shoes gave his heels compared to his other athletic shoes.  He immediately felt the extra support these shoes gave to his instep.  They were tight at first due to his high arch, but after a couple of wears, they fit perfeclty.  His feet are definitely on the mend and he is walking.\n\nWe have even ordered another pair of Asics for him.",

Its truly like walking on air and my feet dont hurt at end of day which is really great. my last pair was Asics Mens Gel Phoenix 2's and it was because of that pair that really got me hooked on Asics. even though i cant comment on the running side of these shoes overall they are a great ride and are worth every penny",

I like a lot of cushion for power walking and the heel strike. These provide that but only after that initial breaking in, each time you walk. The wide heel is very supportive. Buy yeah the shoe does smell - i have washed my shoes already, in cold gentle cycle and that took away some of the odor. shoes look great and have had lots of positive comments.\n\ngave it an overall 4 because it was slightly too stiff for me and not enough instant heel cushion.",

These shoes have such a strong chemical odor that I have to store them in the garage between wearings. When wearing, I constantly get a big waft of this odor that that is very annoying and unpleasant. I kept them thinking that the smell would fade but it's here to stay. Sadly disappointed.",

The shoes are the BEST thing that have happened to come my way in years. B-4 I got these a trip to the grocery store meant stabbing, burning pain about 20 mins. into the trip. Now I can go where I want for up to an *hour (no pain) or longer (very little pain) without that worry. Thank you Asics for this incredible technology and amazing cushioning. I have 5 Homedics products to relieve back pain, I have to take morphine every day, I have to get back injections every 3 months and use an ice bag upto 3 times a day. Until I got these Asics Gel Kinectic 3, I dreaded even a trip to the mail box. I tried other Asics aftter giving up on Nike, New Balance, Adidas, Reebok,Saucony and other brands. First I tried Gel Kayana's (Asics) and then Gel Nimbus 13 and then I finally found these GEMS Gel Kinectic 3's they are the bomb. The cushioning, IGS and construction help me so much I can't put it into words. I actually look forward to going out again after 15 years of it being to painful on my back and feet. If you have lower back problems and walking is unbearable, I give my highest recommendation that you try a pair of these. They are so important to me that I have a Brand NEW pair in a box waiting to save me pain when the pair I am using wear out.",

When I play tennis though, the Kevlar laces dig into my foot and leaves a mark (since they are thin and do not give/stretch); but not so much when running. Wish laces would go up just a little higher on my foot for extra stability when day hiking.\n\nThe sole doesn't last too long though and would show wear in a few months. I still wear them after the sole is well worn without much problem though. Wore for at least a year.",

The Gore-Tex may be a bit warm for warmer climates but seems perfect here. The fit is quite true to size so you need not monkey with that. My North Face equivalent are also awesome but the fit is a bit tighter and possibly more suitable for the trail. I'm sure a thicker pair of socks would make up the difference too. Buy these shoes. You need them. They will make you a better person and undoubtedly attract some very fine ladies.\n\nGood Luck!",

If I lace them so it's even remotely comfortable it's down to the side in just about half an hour of walking around.  I looked around all over the web to see if I was just lacing them up wrong but did not find anything.  These shoes also hurt my feet so bad just walking around it's ridiculous.

I'll run on the streets sometimes and they're awesome because when you step on small rocks they don't get stuck in your shoe and the shoes always keep your foot straight because it's stable so it's hard for you to roll your ankle. They're very flexible when I do pushups or when I'm on my toes. They don't wrinkle like other shoes I've had because the shoes are made of mesh material. These shoes are true to size so get exactly your shoe size don't get bigger or smaller. I definitely recommend these there hasn't been anything about them to complain about and I could see these lasting for years. I want to get a 2nd pair just to wear casually since they're so comfortable. Try these out before anything else!!",

                "review_body": "Over 3,000 miles logged on these shoes and finally they're starting to show wear and tear!!\n\nAt first, when you start running in zig sonics, they feel very awkward, almost like plastic blocks on the feet, but after two weeks of repetitive use, they break in, and become the best running shoes for long distance. They even have a natural spring effect, because of their ribbed design, so after each impact of your feet against pavement, it feels like you're jolted off of it. The shoe design and natural spring effect really support a runner's strides and prevents injury. I think these shoes, with their zig design, protect the feet more than any other pair of shoes out there on the market for runners. Even if you land in them wrong they still protect you from getting shin splints!\n\nI've been wearing my pair since I purchased them back in early May of 2011, logging 60 miles a week, usually 8 mile a day runs and extensions of 9-10 mile runs on my weekends, still there is little wear and tear in the shoes, nor a decrease in my pace. My previous running shoes only lasted 5 months before I needed to buy new ones - the heel cushioning would wear away and create holes in the cloth, which would then rub and chafe against my skin, causing very painful blisters. Zigs, doesn't create this common problem, and has a VERY LONG LIFE. If you're looking for shoes for long distance runs, this is the shoe for you, if you're looking for a shoe to support shorter runs on a track, I'd look to other brands.\n\nAll in all, this is a superb shoe for running!  I've never worn a pair which has lasted me this long!",

I am looking forward to getting some miles on these shoes.. Love em...\n\nI have had these shows now for some time.  Well, last year I couldn't mow my own lawn.  This year I can. And you know, when you mow with a push mower your doing a lot of walking.  So I decided what the heck  I might as well be comfortable while I am mowing. OMG. These things are GREAT.  I have mowed my lawn ALL summer and a couple others as well.  I wash them in the dryer and put them out in the sun to dry.  Im sure I could get them a little cleaner but why, im mowing more grass.

                "review_body": "I run in the Asics Hyper Speed, the greatest all around road shoe ever made.  I have been looking for an additional road shoe with a similar low heel to toe ratio with a bit more cushioning for long runs as well as recovery runs.  I've tried the Brooks Pure Connect, Asics Gel Lyte33, and the Saucony Kinvara.  All of them showed great potential but didn't work out for one reason or another.  I stumbled across the Grid Fiya by accident at Shoe Carnival and loved it instantly.  I immediately looked it up online and ordered it in black.  It has a lower heel to toe drop than the Gel Lyte33 at only 4mm.  It's also wider than both the Pure Connect and Gel Lyte  and a bit lower to the ground than the Kinvara.  It provides all the protection and feel for the ground I was looking for.  The only drawbacks are some cheaper material around the Saucony logo on the upper and it also weighs a little more at just under 10 oz. for a men's size 9.  If Saucony would upgrade the upper material and make this shoe as light as those I mentioned, this would be the best \"protective\" minimal road shoe out there.  As for me, it's the best available option for my rotation with the Hyper Speed and the best road shoe for the money.",

The shoes did not provide cushioning or support and simply never felt right.This shoe is designed to be one of the premium Asics cushioned models but cushioning was definitely lacking, maybe my feet are simply shaped wrong for the shoes but nothing about them felt right to me.  The toe box was huge and my feet simply slid from side to side in them as if they were the wide model.

I underpronate and usually run in the asics gel nimbus and it is for people with high arches.  I also have a size 16 foot, so unfortunately I can't just walk into a store and try on shoes because no one will carry that size.(Very Frustrating!!) So I ordered them and tried them on and immediately the arch support felt weird.  It pushed up into my foot.  I walked around the house to see if it would feel any different, but its hard to tell unless you run in them.  Of course once you do that, you can't send them back.  So I went for a run, and unfortunately they hurt worse while running.  These shoes are definitely only for those with very, very high arches.  It pushes so hard into your arch, and the rest of the shoe is to tight around your foot.  The gel nimbus is much better.  Guess I know for next time.  If you are considering, make sure you try it on in a store, but I would stay away.  Overall an ASICS letdown.",

Buyers beware, if you are buying these for straight running and dont need lateral support they might be ok for you but for cross/circuit training, or even running on treadmill at incline they stink!",

More than normally experience with a new shoe, the ASICS gave me significant abrasion blisters on the insides of my heels.

These shoes has a natural grace to them, like a get up in go feeling when you put them on. The upside-down side of this that i dont necessarily hate, but can be a problem if anyone ever decides to run in the mountains or something. Theres a possibility of tearing up the thin cloth material on the front of the shoe if you get them caught on something rigid or serrated, however thats only a case by case scenario. My Third pair came from this sorta thing. Hands Down i love theses shoes and i recommend them to anyone.",

I tried all of the big names in running, but never found a shoe that really felt great.  I was skeptical at first to even try running in shoes made by Skechers; but I am extremely glad that I did try them.  These are the best running shoes I have tried.  I am now on my fourth pair of these shoes and would not run without them at this point.  They are lightweight and provide me with a very minimalistic feel for running.  At the same time the cushioning is good enough to allow me to put in long runs without any issues.  Just a fantastic running shoe.",

The soles of these shoes are extremely soft which means you'll only get about 30 miles out of them or less if you are a heavy runner. Based on the durability of these shoes I definitely think at $70 bucks they are way way way way over priced....these shoes should be sold for about $20 Max due to their lack of durability.\n\nI suspect if you use them for walking they may last a bit longer....just a tad bit.\n\n*UPDATE*\nI have now downgraded my original rating from three stars to two stars. Just after 5 runs in this shoe I have developed shin splints and pain in the ankle. It seems Skechers has not learned a lesson from it's $40M lawsuit re: Skechers shape ups. The designers in Skechers seems to be more concerned with the 'appearance' and \"colouring' of their products rather than it's trustworthiness, performance levels and durability.\n\nNo serious runner will consider these Skechers go runs and once the soling of these shoes are gone which occur between 20 to 30 miles runners run a serious risk of incurring some type of running injury, be it shin splints or plantar fasciitis.\n\nSkechers shoes are great for casual wear....I love their styles....but regards running I'll avoid their shoes like a plague because you'll probably end up with an injury.",

Having run in my Asics I started getting some knee pain after my runs and I also started getting some pretty bad shin splints.  I run about 50 miles a month so I am not a very heavy mileage runner.  What I discovered was I was a heel striker and I needed to correct my gait.  A friend of mine runs for Skechers and I started looking at reviews.  I was blown away by the reviews and thought the reviews were too good to be true.  Guess what, THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY TRUE.  These are hands down the best shoes I have ever run in.  Super lightweight and it feels like you are not wearing anything.  I can't wait to run my next half marathon in September in them.  I have no knee pain and my shin splints have not even began to rear their head the last two runs in these AWESOME shoes.  If your on the fence, just buy them.

Times changed after I, on a whim, ordered a set of Sketichers Go Walk shoes. They were so comfortable to wear in the house and out, because they conform to the shape of your foot bottom, that you rock and your proper cadence and step without being forced into a gait by the stiffness of the sole. That bottom texture lets you feel the ground without it hurting your foot. Your feet suddenly start to waken up and feel the ground like your hands feel objects. You can use your toes better to manage your grip as you go up and down stairs, to realize when you're losing traction sooner, and to feel more like your feet are your friend instead of a pain point.\n\nThese shoes have all of the \"good\" that I got from the Go Walk line, in a modern but more traditional looking sneaker.\n\nMy first pair of Sketchers many years ago disappointed me totally because they made my feet hurt, felt flat and felt like cheap style shoes with no substance. I couldn't feel any more opposite than that about Sketchers after my experience with the Go lines of shoes. You won't be disappointed.",

I didnt enjoy running with these shoes from the beginning. I was used to the Go Run Ride which support midfoot running a lot. Not so the Go Run 2. You wont notice a midfoot running support. A difference at the beginning but not to bad. After some days I started to like these shoes.\nThese shoes are so light - you will feel like running barefoot and you wont sweat in these shoes.\nBut ... after a very short time I noticed, that the sole started to wear out. How could this be ? Maybe because of the supersoft sole ? I dont know, but this disappointed me a lot.  Specially in the backarea of the sole  the shoes are gone ( how can this happen with midstroke running).\nSo I cannot 100 % recommend these shoes .

With the \"Ride\" version I bought a (men's) size 8.5 because the 8.0 was a bit short and tight in the toe box. The compromise is that the shoe is a bit wide for me in and I do get blisters on long runs (8+ miles) on hot days. So, I just bought a pair of 8.5 GoRun 2 shoes thanks to an Amazon special, to test the difference. While they have the same feel in the heel they are definitely tighter in the toe box. I went for a 3.6 mi run in the neighborhood this morning--up and down hills--to test them out. The fit seemed to work--no problems other than feeling tight in the toes. The tighter toe box should make me less prone to blisters, but I'm still unsure about how it will affect me on longer runs. Can't test that until after my half-marathon on Sept 7--too risky at this point (one week out).",

It started with one shoe, and now both make the loud click.  I no longer wear these shoes casually; they are still comfortable for working out on a treadmill as long as I wear headphones and can't hear the incessant clicking.  I would toss the shoes except that they set me back a good bit of money.\n\nOriginal review:\n\nI have been very happy with these light sketcher runners.  They are very light and thin, but the sole is made well enough so that I don't feel the bumps in the trail like I do with my other minimalist shoes.  I se these to walk and run on pavement, gravel, and sandy trails.  So far so good, especially considering I have somewhat flat feet.  The only minor complaint so far is that the tongue of the shoe tends to shift to one side too easily, requiring occasional adjustment.  It would be great if they could find a way to sew it in so it would stay more straight.  Also, the mesh is not extremely rugged, so be careful using these where branches, rocks, or other threatening objects could put a tear n the mesh.  Nice shoe from Sketchers.",

Fit is true to size, although getting the shoe onto the foot requires a bit more effort, since the tongue only relaxes so much when the laces are loosened.  Once on, the shoe fits like it forms to the foot.\n\nThe only thing I don't like about the shoe is the liner it comes with gets bent out of shape very easily, and tends to double up under the foot.

                "review_body": "I have to be up front, I don't subscribe to the minimalist epidemic that is going around the running world right now. However there is something to be said for getting away from the more traditional running shoe.  A normal running shoe is big and bulky and doesn't really encourage an efficient gait. However you can, like everything else in the world, have too much of a good thing, which is the case with these extreme minimalist shoes that are out on the market right now.  These shoes have a low drop (difference in height between the back and the front of the shoe) to encourage a more efficient mid-foot strike and have 11mm of padding, which new independant research has shown is about perfect.  So, enough of all that on to the shoe.  Over the past nine months I have had 2 pairs (technically the original GoRuns) of these and am just starting on these (GoRun 2s) now.  I run about 100mi a month and I get about 4 months out of them, which is about typical for any running shoe.  I love the fit and feel of these as they are designed as a sockless running shoe.  As a triathlete who doesn't wear socks during races up to the 70.3 distance (half-marathon run) these are perfect and I don't get any blisters at all.  The original Go Runs had a more pronouced \"bump\" under the arch and if the truth be told I really liked that as while running it provided an excellent arhc support for your foot, the Go Run 2s have a less pronouced \"bump\" but seem to provide pretty good support for the foot.  The soles of the shoes of the original GoRuns is where I have my only complaint, to keep the shoes so lightweight there is hardly any \"traditional\" rubber in the sole but most of the sole is made of the foam padding called \"resalyte\" which seems to wear slightly faster than the harder rubber used for the \"impulse sensors\" that are made of more traditional rubber material.  Overall, though these are an excellent shoe that has replaced my racing flats as well as my tradional running shoes.",

                "review_body": "Initial Impression\nThe Skechers GoRun2 hits so many sweet spots for me in terms of weight, flexibility, cushioning and simplicity. Feather light at 6.7 oz (Men\u2019s size 10), I never feel weighed down. There is great flexibility on every axis so I never feel like my foot fights the shoe. The stack height (11mm forefoot, 20mm midfoot, and 15mm heel) provides a nice plushness without being overly soft. This shoe on paper looks stiff. I would look at that 11mm in the forefoot and think this is probably a pretty firm shoe. I would be wrong. It\u2019s Goldilocks.\n\nFit\nThe upper is light and stretchy making for a sock-like feeling over the forefoot. The four way mesh provides plenty of breathability, especially during these hot summer months. According to Pete over at RunBlogger, the Skechers team slimmed the forefoot width just a little from the original GoRun. My feet run a touch wide so I love all the help I can get in the width. I sized up to a 10 from my usual 9.5.\n\nI get just a little heel slippage in the GoRun 2 that I think could be easily remedied with the addition of an extra eyelet similar to the vari-lock system in the GoRun Meb Speed.\n\nDurability\nWith just over 50 miles in the GR2\u2019s I am noticing some significant wear in the heel and forefoot. I think it\u2019s just part of the trade off when it comes to light weight shoes. Additional outsole rubber would increase both durability and weight. Most of time I\u2019ll take light weight over longer miles. I expect to get close to 200-250 miles out of this pair. Since this shoe can be found for approximately $60 through online retailers, including Amazon, I feel I\u2019m getting my money\u2019s worth.\n\nBest Suited For\nThe GR2 has been my daily trainer now for a few weeks. I\u2019ve used them for everything from track/speed workouts to longer runs upwards of 8 miles. They\u2019ll be my racing shoe for an upcoming 10K. I would have no hesitations about this shoe for any distance up to a half marathon.\n\nCons\nI find the shoes uncomfortable to walk in. The beveled heel and thicker mid-foot stack height make me feel unstable. I don\u2019t, however, notice this lack of stability while running.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, I think the security of the fit in the heel could be improved with an extra eyelet.\n\nConclusion\nThe GoRun2 is a fantastic shoe overall. For a light weight, cushioned, flexible and simple trainer under $100, Skechers brought it.",

                "review_body": "I read reviews on these shoes that claimed they were great for heal strikers like me.  Wrong!  These are the worse shoes I've ever run in.  The angled heel on this shoe causes me to strike on it's flat surface instead of getting a gradual cushioning as I would in a normal running shoe.  I got a \"clonking\" feeling while running on level surfaces.  It's okay running up hills and surprisingly to me, it wasn't bad running downhill.  I'm a 61 year old male, and after my normal 4 mile run both of my knees are so sore that I can hardly walk down the stairs in our house.  These shoes will not be used again for running, but may be used for the Stairmaster where heel striking won't be an issue.\n\nOn a positive note, I loved the fit, feel and look of the shoe.  They fit like a glove, and are as light as a feather.  For those runners who don't strike with their heels I imagine these would be great shoes.",

The original Go Runs had the most noticeable center bump, which I didn't mind when running but I didn't like wearing them for just walking around in. The rides and the ultras (basically the same shoe) lessened the bump and increased the cushion slightly. Still some bump but an improvement for me.\n\nThe Go Run 2's are my favorite of the group. If you get one of the neon colors, the internet pictures don't do them justice. They are bright and really look good in person. Probably one of the best looking shoes on the market and if you like the brighter looks that have become popular in the last few years, these are the best. The upper is just as comfortable as on the first Go Runs. almost sock like. The shoes are very light and flexible. The sole is nicely cushioned, but these are more minimal then most running shoes. I am 6'3\" and 210. I love them on the treadmill wear I can get the foot and calf strength benefits of the low heel toe drop, flexible sole, and minimal cushion but at my size I wouldn't run in these on the road. A smaller person probably could pull it off though. Also these feel good walking around in or lifting weights in, something the first Go Runs couldn't do for me.\n\nI usually wear a 12 in most brands (also what my other Skechers have been) and I got the same in these. They seem to fit the same although maybe a smidgen tighter but I haven't had any issues. I did pick up a size 12.5 as they were 65% off and found they fit fine as well.\n\nOutstanding shoe. Don't let the Skechers name scare you away. These are well made and great for actually running in.",

Before these I had the Nike TW 13's and absolutely hated them!  My feet were in pain within about an hour of walking or even just hitting balls at the range.  I should have known better than to stray from Ecco after all the business shoes I've purchased over the years.  Ecco seems to really care about their customer's feet!

On the course, I consistently get blisters on the heels on both feet and end up limping by around the 4th hole. I have to put band aids under my socks in order to finish the round. I have tried to work out why this happens - they fit perfectly and are the correct size - and worked out that the blisters are exactly the spot where the leather of the upper heel joins with the soft padding at the top of the shoe. The join creates a bump at the back of the shoe which is causing the blisters. In the past I wore less fashionable and cheaper Footjoys and had no problems with them. I really regret being swayed by the looks of these $200 plus shoes as they have proved to be very dissapointing. I would return them if I could - and should have done so after my first round in them - but keep hoping that they would wear in. They haven't!",

They seemed pretty good when wearing them around the house, but when I got on the course and wore then for a while, they might have stretched out across the toe area. They seemed a little wider and looser than what I would like to have had them.  I tried on a pair prior to buying these and they seemed pretty good.  My feet are sensitive and I have inserts that I wear in other shoes.  I didn't want to have to wear them in these.  I have found that when I do put the inserts in, the width seems to be closer to what I had expected,  but the heel is too high.  I could be a rare case, but I was hoping that the Ecco shoe would be the solution.  I'm not sure where to go from here.  They feel like they are an extra wide rather than medium.  I checked the shoe and they appear to be the right size.  Hope this helps..",

Around the ankle and rear foot the fit is really great.  But the front part of the shoe is for an unbelievably wide foot.  I suppose it should be an 4E [That is: EEEE].  If I'd gotten them for running I'd give them one or two stars but I got them for dog walking.  So, for me the important part is rear foot and ankle and that part of the shoe fits perfect.\n  I don't know if the shoes will last but they seem like they should.

They don't seem to be as durable or well made as my Merrel's, but at $25 I wouldn't expect them to be.  The soles seem to be on the softer side (good for grip, bad for longevity) and the leather (pleather?) is pretty thin so I don't know how long they'll hold up.  We'll see.  I can wear these all day at work and be comfortable in them....after replacing the insoles with gel insoles.  The factory insoles kind of suck but thankfully they are removable.  I wish more shoes had removable insoles but many companies glue them in.  The only other negative is that they are a little big.  Both my foot and the gel insole that I cut to fit tell me that these (size 11) are closer to a size 11-1/2 or 12.  I would advise ordering at least a half size down from what you normally wear or plan on wearing thick socks.",

I am an avid runner and bought these just to wear casually, but I HAD to take them for a run, just to see how they performed.  What I noticed is that the grooves on the sole of the shoe pick up every little rock as you run.  The grooves are deep enough for those rocks to get pretty wedged in there, so when you are running on pavement you hear that dreaded \"click-click-click\" with each footfall.  I recommend these shoes as \"wear-around\" shoes, but not as serious running shoes.  For the price, they are pretty good shoes.",

I refuse to pay over 70 bucks for a shoe so I'm always hunting for a bargain. After a couple OCR's (obstacle course races) and a bicycle wreck my brooks running shoes were ready to retire. I saw these for a little over 50 bucks. Fresh out of the box I decide to go all out 8 mile run, counteracts what I said earlier about distance running but bear with me. I wasn't worried about hurting my feet because I can never even remember having a blister, god gifted me with invincible foot i suppose. Length in the shoe was great I had about a .25 inch between my longest toe and the end of the shoe which is generally what I look for. From my arch back was great shoes hugged my heel well. from the arch forward I experienced a problem I've never encountered before, movement. Plain and simple I had to much play the shoe runs wide and isn't narrow enough to grip my feet snug this can be looked over if running on level roads without a lot of sharp turns. Along my route I also gave these a go in the grass and since I was running to a marina even gave them a go in the sand. I generally look for a good all around shoe, sadly these are not it. If you are however looking for good valued running shoe to JUST run with, you should consider these. They are lightweight decently cushioned and broke in rather easy for me.

The issue there is that i would wear through my shoes very quickly, none lasting me more than 8 or 9 months before they would become \"unwearable\" and were downgraded to my lawn work pair. That being said...\n\nThis pair has been great, I have been using them specifically for running, be it on the treadmill or street. They provide a good amount of arch support, and perform well with my form. (Toe runner) I have yet to have any issues with them except for once where I found that I had worn them too loosely and had gone for a 6 mile run. For the next few days i had pain on the top of my foot, but after making sure that I wear them a little more snug no longer an issue.\n\nI have provided photos to show that after well over a half year of using them daily they still have good tread and they are not falling apart. Previous shoes (my old Nike Runs) would start having the sole rip off the bottoms at the front of the shoe, which i attribute to the fact that my heel rarely touches when I run.\n\nFor anyone looking for a good running shoe I def recommend these. They are lightweight and took about a week to break in properly.",

Between the sleek design, comfortable fit, and support that comes from the air bags around the sole, this was a great purchase, even for the steep price. I've had the shoe for less than 24 hours and I'm already getting compliments about the shoe. This is now one of the nicer pairs of shoes that I own, and I far from regret the purchase. The colors match with almost piece of clothing I own, making it a nice casual shoe to wear to class or other events. I wouldn't recommend wearing this for physical activity, due to the shoe being a low top. Your ankles might not be able to handle a sharp cut to the hoop, or whatnot.",

Throw in some aftermarket insoles, and you have got yourself a wonderful shoe.\n\nI own 3 other pairs of New Balance, and these are the best I have bought yet. I love all of my New Balance. Yet I would say as far as looks, and support combined these bad boys take the cake.\n\nNew Balance gets my money also because most of their shoes are assembled in the USA.

One thing that I like is how thin the tongue is, my foot does feel excessively strapped down.  When I first stepped into them they felt strange like I was on small stilts, but I think that is the springy Hoka cushioning, and the strange feeling goes away once you start the run.

They still had plenty of cushion plenty of cushion but weren't overly cushioned. The stock arch support isn't great especially for those with flat feet so I recommend buying one at your local pharmacy or sporting goods store for $10. These fit my averaged width foot nicely, but those with super wide feet may find the shoe a bit constricting. They seem to be wearing nicely and the aesthetics of the shoe are simply awesome.\nA+",

They don't feel super high quality but for now their excellent comfort trumps that. Hope they last!",

How ever they are very light,  good walking shoes, but definitely not good running shoes made for hard surfaces like concrete. Im afraid if I jog half a mile on concrete I'll get shinsplints easy.  The insole wasnt fully glued on. The insoles are like air, sketchers memory foam is thicker and probably more comfortable than the \"memory foam \" in these. If I scrunch my toes the sole will slide back with them (in both shoes). So that sucks. At the end of the day, I paid $40 bucks for them, you get what you pay for. However I am surprised that they were once  $69-79 something like that. I would not have paid that much for something like these. So all in all im somewhat satisfied considering the money spent but Im not jumping for joy.",

I am 6' tall, and I weigh 230 lbs, so I am a well built man (sorry ladies, I'm taken). You will not regret this purchase. Just insure that you purchase the shoes 1 size larger than you usually would as these Reeboks run small. I had to return mine, and the return was not a hassle. If you find my review helpful, please give my review a \"like\". Thank you, and happy walking, running, jogging, skipping, or whatever else you plan on doing in these awesome shoes!",

The memory tech foam is essentially a great cusion that surprisingly lasts and doesn't just mold to your foot and stay. These shoes are replacing a pair similar but only because the others got wet and the soles were wearing...plus I wanted to get something new and at the price (circa 39 bucks) it was decided for me, basically.\n\nThe first thing that I checked was to see if my old shoes were still as comfortable as the new ones (I thought the new would be different; in a good way) but the old shoes insoles held up perfectly! Felt 99% as good as new...which is awesome!\n\nI don't use these for crossfit but more for everyday shoes so I cannot attest to their wear in strenuous activities daily but they have held up to the rigors of a father of 3 that is constantly going and going and going! Between baseball, school and work, these hold up well and don't break the bank!\n\nFit is great as well. I wear a size 10.5 in Nike's but a size 10 in these. I also have very WIDE feet (DD). This was of no consequence and they fit perfectly.\n\nI absolutely recommend these for anyone wanting a comfortable shoe or someone on their feet a lot...these and Zigtech shoes are EXCELLENT!!",

I bought a separate set of memory foam insoles to go in the shoe. I think they're called Happy Step. Only 14 bucks. Now these shoes are super comfortable.\n\nI am an automotive painter so I stand, kneel, bend, crawl, etc all day long on cement and by the end of the day my feet, knees and hips were in lots of pain. Now that I bought these shoes and the extra insoles, all that pain has vanished. It's actually kind of blown my mind. I never thought shoes would make such a massive difference the way my body felt. Being as that I'm a painter, the shoes are already extremely dirty and look like I've had them for well over a year but I've only had them about 2 months. I've seriously considered buying them again to have a nice pair I wear outside of work.\n\nI rode my harley with these shoes on and noticed that a lot of wind comes through the shoe. They definitely breathe. Felt a really nice breeze on my toes. I would imagine the air flow helps with odor and all that stuff.\n\nThey fit true to size.

These Boost are by far better, you feel like your walking on pillows but without the give. The only nock I have on this particular model is the toe/top of the shoe is thin breathable foam like material, so if you try and move something out of your way with your foot like a ball, chair, etc, you will regret it lol. These are strictly walking or doing nothing shoes. The second knock on them is that I have yet to find a pair of socks that I can wear that doesn't cause the shoe to squeak. Barefoot there is no squeak but with socks you will get it and if you are in a quiet area you will notice. Can't wait to try the boost training shoes",

If you are just starting out with Newtons I agree with others that you should definitely start the transition slowly a couple miles at a time, your calves will thank you.",

(The calves would hurt.) I only ran in them. I bought two pairs of 8's. Huge mistake. The midsoles did nothing. It's as if they weren't there. There was so little cushioning that my feet and legs hurt like crazy. I had to put in extra insoles just to wear them. Worse off, each pair lasted one month. Back with the early Gravities, maybe 3 or 4, a pair would last me 7 or 8 months. With the Gravity 8, the sole did not stand up to any wear at all. I gave up on Newton and am using a different brand. Nowhere near as good as the early Gravity models, but at least usable.",

So when I saw that they were \"upgraded\" to the Kismet 2, I took it for granted that they would fit like the originals. Luckily, I always bought the Kismets a half-size larger than I needed, because the Kismet 2 is sized a half-size smaller. So if you wear an 11 1/2, get a size 12. If you wear a 12, buy a 12 1/2., etc..\nSo, while they are a little more snug than what I prefer, I'll know better what to size to buy next time.",

However, they clearly make up for it in more important demands made by my feet. I've always needed a more cushioned shoe. I can say after two tempo runs and a long 15 mile training run that I felt the same as if I ran only a 5k. I rate these based on musculoskeletal pain after a run. I had none.

Also, these are heavier than expected, in no small part due to an unnecessarily heavy, rubbery insole, that again, does not contribute to any additional cushioning sensation, only additional weight.

I shop with New Balance because I wear a 4E and have low arches, and many manufacturers of decent running/cross-training shoes are either too high in the arch or don't even stock 2E/4E anymore. I've had two prior pairs of the 940v2, and they fit about perfectly out of the box, with only very slight stiffness (usually my left foot, which may be a bit flatter/wider) that broke in reasonably quickly. On this pair, the right foot seems OK, about as normal for the left foot of the v2. But the left foot is a bit too tight with the stabilization, and presses on the outside of my arch. It isn't that noticeable until I've walked about a mile, but its a significant downgrade from v2.\n\nOn the plus side... the color scheme/aesthetics are nicer, I guess?\n\nTL;DR: If you are going to change a successful model for a smaller market niche, please keep the functionality the same.

I have plantar fasciitis so my feet are more sensitive now than they used to be so it might not bother others.\n\nI loved the looks of these shoes and would have loved to keep them but with the heel discomfort, i had to send them back.

I can't reliably assess these shoes without taking into consideration that they are the first type of super-light shoe I've owned.\n\nThe color is a blush pink (Sunrise) - I would call it a light peachy pink.  It's a pretty color, although it does sort of seem like a \"golf shoe\" to me, lol. (I'm not sure why).\n\nFit: perfect and I'm traditionally an 8m. (My foot is narrow, but that doesn't usually make much of a difference so I go for M shoes).\nLook: could be great for \"running around\" but also for walking and light workouts. I would not necessarily think of these as supportive running shoes, but I stopped running years ago, so it's possible that another real runner should comment on that.\n\nPrice: I paid $65USD and the fulfillment was from Beall's in FL.  It took longer than usual to receive them, and I think these were one of few blush/Sunrise pairs left for sale.\n\nI plan to keep and use these, and I'll update if I experience workmanship issues.",

They are very good for walking and the cushioned insole is so comfortable. I love these shoes and I am glad I bought them",

The hues are lovely: a subtle darkened lavender shade complemented by a slightly purple-tinged gray. Once your feet are shod in these running shoes and you tie the laces, you may slip them off and slip into them, with the aid of a shoe horn, the next time you wear them... no need to tie and untie them each time. They boast a bootie construction--each shoe's tongue is not separate and is part of the fabric. There are no seams inside the toebox to irritate toes or feet. There is a noticeable arch support in the soles. I ordered my usual NB size, and they did fit just like Cinderella's glass slipper. As a pluviophile, who enjoys long walks in the rain, there might be one caveat: the upper mesh fabric seems as though it would permit raindrops to soak through the shoes...so I would try to wear these fantastic running shoes only when the meteorologist does not forecast rain. This footwear may be worn with either thin or thick socks. They are so very comfortable and they are the epitome of a fashion statement for your feet. Highly recommended for unbelievable comfort, beautiful understated hues of color, and lovely style....",

When I ordered a pair, I expected the same quality the Tri series afforded. Well... these shoes are garbage by comparison. Issues: (1) Although they're slightly lighter than Tri 10s and 11s, the weight is clearly cut from the sole. The \"Flyte Foam\" is both thin under the ball of the foot, and very soft. What this means is that if you run hard, weight over 180, do a lot of sprints, and/or strike on the ball of the foot, these shoes aren't for you. On medium distance runs, the balls of my feet end up ranging from tender to bruised. (2) The tongue is far to thick, so it bunches up if you like tight laces. This, of course, causes discomfort. (3) Unlike the Tris, the heel cup on the FF 2 is pretty aggressive, so it takes some breaking in. (4) The Tris had bold color schemes that made a statement. The FF 2 is just...weird. Cosmetically, it's like the running shoe equivalent of an early 90s mullet.",

I have rotated Gravity and Distance for years, but Gravity 7 run about a half size smaller than past models, and the outer lugs have caused bruising on both feet just below and outside my pinkie toes. So strange! I've changed the lacing and wear them with thinner socks, which has helped some. I'm not sure this issue could have been solved by ordering up a half/full size. They just don't fit the same as the used to.  I did not return them, trying to give them a fighting chance. They cannot stand up to long runs, but have been OK for shorter workouts and gym stuff. I'll probably be taking a break from Newton for a while after this experience. Too bad!",

These shoes are doing the job on asphalt and cement surfaces.  I don't know if the forward part of the sole would be comfortable in any kind of rough terrain.  Back to BOA.  At 80, I have had enough of lacing-up.  So this system is worth making a shoe buying decision for me.  Click the knob down and turn a small amount and it tightens the laces evenly.  I always tighten just a little and after walking a minute, I can bend down and tighten very easily if I need tighter.  But they loosen even easier.  Just pull the knob up and your laces go completly loose.  Just pull up on the tongue and yer done!  Nice shoes, but the reason I bought was for BOA - and I am very happy with the purchase.",

I decided that the track spikes I've been using since 8th grade weren't cutting it out anymore.  I just received these shoes a couple of minutes ago and they look insanely cool.  It's pretty lightweight and has a strong spike plate, which is awesome.  Obviously I haven't been able to use them yet, but they're awesome and seem to be worth every penny.  Defiantly gonna show my friends at school tomorrow.  Make sure to go to the search bar and search up these shoes if you are looking for different colors.  I bought mine in blue because they go with my school colors.  I for sure suggest buying these :)",

The ISO Fit really helps with getting the spike to wrap around your foot comfortably. Grip is excellent, as you'd expect for a 10 spike, full plate. My school unfortunately runs on a dirt/sand track so these have already seen wear on the pike plate after only two 100m dashes during practice, so I will definitly be using these exclusively for meets. Other than that, which is expected, they are pretty light considering they cary 10 spikes each, and feel even lighter when you're sprinting down the track. Definitly recommend these to any sprinters looking for a high quality sprint, full plate spike.",

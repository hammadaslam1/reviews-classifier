Also is waterproof ran sleeve of jacket under sink and when I touched the jacket after it wasn't even wet on the surface. Can't speak to durability yet but zippers could be an issue in future but only time will tell and I will update after some uses",

Returned for an XXL that I can comfortably layer over a thicker long sleeve shirt and vest for really cold weather. Ships from China which took weeks and return postage was over $20.

The soft shell was conventional layout, not unlike TAD, Helikon, etc. The fabrics feels a micro denser than Helikon, and has better Velcro closures\u2026 Another nice touch is the removeable hood\u2026 You can either roll it into the collar compartment, or unzip it and completely remove it, which is a handy feature\u2026 (I keep the hood stashed in the rear duck pocket of the jacket\u2026)\n\nThe only thing I find odd are the internal pockets, which have zips that face sideways, limiting the use range of the pockets. They\u2019re large enough to fit a few credit cards/ID cards, but not much else, which limits their utility\u2026",

It has already been through a rain shower and I did not get wet. Make sure you put silicone lube or some other type of lube on the zippers and they'll work Great. I have heard of people who use soap as a lube. Just be Careful so you don't stain your Jacket.\nSo far I am pleased with the order. I would have given it 5 stars if I didn't have to live the zippers before I could use the Jacket. These are very well made and should last a long time as long as I keep the zippers lubed. Other people have complained about the zippers they work Great as long as you keep them from sticking. Very easy cheap fix for a great Jacket ??",

As soon as I opened the package, the smell hit me like a punch in the face.  I washed it immediately and the smell is gone.  Just not what I expected considering how warm and well constructed this coat is.  Still recommend buying one, but maybe from a vendor closer to home that doesn't smoke around their products.",

I am 6'3\" tall, and the sleeves fit perfectly right down to the wrist on the XXL jacket.  The sleeves are not adjustable at the wrist, but seem well fit as they are at wrist.  One thing I like about the fit of this coat is that it does not have too much fabric in front.  Even though it does not have an adjustable waistband, the jacket is well enough fitted that it does not have to be partially zipped to stay close to my body.  The color seems a little bit more blue in person than it looks on the screen.  I have received several compliments on the color.  The pocket on the chest is also nice.  It holds my iPhone in an Otterbox Defender case perfectly, which makes my phone more accessible when I am doing things.",

As expected, DWR not quite as good as on a tighter weave -- but works OK sprinkling it from a faucet. Ordered a size small, at a middle-aged 5' 8\", 160 lbs. Shoulder and sleeves have generous room, tummy not so much but still OK. The inside fleece is dense, but pretty thin. Jacket seems warm enough for 40-50s but not super warm. But... the zipper is left-handed (same as US women's side) so unfortunately going to send it back. Had a Helly Hansen (men's) jacket with a wrong side zipper, and every time I pulled the zipper down with my right hand it would and not separate. YMMV, but too annoying for me.",

I'm a firm believer in camo that matches your environment and when you are 20' up in a stand the sky is your background. To make a long story short, on Oct. 16th a 15 point 5-1/2 year old whitetail buck walked toward me on an old logging road and stopped 10 yards from my tree. He then turned sideways and the rest is history. 3rd biggest buck in the state taken with a crossbow, in cheap but effective camo. Ok now the secret is out, this is good stuff. I also bought the matching rain gear, but never got a chance to try it.",

Some smile, some laugh, some really like it and want one. The jacket itself is great quality. It is very lightweight, true to size (I am 6 feet and 205 pounds - I got a large and it feels well). The jacket has 2 sets of LED lights on it: one on the zipper for the front pocket (purple and white blinking) and a set of LEDs (reddish/orangish) on the right shoulder. The shoulder lights can either blink, be always on or off. The jacket looks very futuristic because of the lights and the silver sheen of the jacket. More than person suggested I was from Tron or the future. Very cool overall.",

It got to Iowa in a timely manner so the company really seems to be on the ball. As for product review, I'd say it is exactly as it is described. Waterproof, breathable, wind resistant -- to sum it up Weatherproof! It has a nice soft inside and outside is still soft but durable. The hood seemed a little 'short' kind of like it was too small for the length of the coat but it is really nice with its own bill and cinchers to keep it on your head tight. We even ran the sink water over the sleeve and the water just beaded off the cloth. All in all very good jacket, just as good as 'famous name brands' like Columbia, The North Face etc.",

So usually I have to make a choice, risk getting cold/wet, or go full Eskimo with the accompanying clumsiness.\n\nAs you can see from the list of features, this jacket solves the problems I have pretty well, without the drawbacks I had.\n\nAlthough the product cautioned that it cannot withstand heavy rain, I've not yet gone through one that it can't take on. Not for now.\nBeing small is another thing I like (fit in a pouch, finally!). It does not have the thermal layer like the Gunfighter, so you might still need to layer yourself wearing it. I tend to alternate between tropical and arid areas so this is actually not a cons for me though.\n\nPricing is another plus. You don't usually get a functional, good looking softshell for this low.\n\nVelcro for patches and the tacticool that make me look less dumb, are the cherries on top.\n\nAll in all, wow it IS a good jacket! Now if I can find a rainproof pant to go with it......",

                "review_body": "I have to say that being from the U.S. I took a bit of a shot in the dark on this purchase since I was not able to physically try it on or check it out in a store prior to the purchase (I live near Boston and haven't seen Craghoppers in any stores in the area).  This  review will be mostly an initial impression type review, since I have yet to take the jacket on any particularly trying excursions.\n\nFit: I normally wear XL sized shirts/jackets. For this Jacket I went with XXL (I have owned a Craghoppers Corey 4 fleece for some time, and am familiar with their sizing - I attribute it to the fact that it's a UK company and their sizes simply run differently across the pond).  The sleeve length is slightly longer than a shirt would be (this is a good thing, provides more coverage). The adjustable cuffs have a great range of adjustment.\n\nFinish: a really well made (remember I haven't tortured it yet) garment. zippers work well, seems are nicely sealed, draw strings seem sturdy. One thing to note is (as will all Craghoppers tops that are not from the Bear Grylls line) the zipper on the men's gear is on the \"wrong\" side for us stateside folks, zipping up with the left hand is not challenging but just takes getting used to.\n\nThings to note:\n1. This is not a \"Heavy\" jacket. It does keep the wind out, but I would say this is a 3-season jacket unless you put a fleece under it.\n2. It does not have the ability to zip a Craghoppers fleece into it, not sure where I read that it did (another site possibly?), but it doesn't.\n3. The hood is removable, but not neatly storable, unless you count in a pocket.\n\nOverall I give it 4.5 stars. If I could zip in a liner or stow the hood in the collar, it would be 5. But those are FAR from deal breakers and the rest of the jacket really makes up for that. If you are a real outdoors person and want a nice looking jacket that you wouldn't be afraid to get some pine sap on, I would highly recommend this. If you just want to look outdoorsy in your land rover, stick to The North Fake or Patagucci.",

Found Mishmi Takin and decided that, rather than try to find one all-purpose jacket, would get 2 different compatible ones. Stumbled across Mishmi Takin and was delighted to discover them. Bought both a Qaras and a Cayambe - just lovely jackets. Very well made, waterproof, windproof of course. But what was best about them was each is both extremely light for what it is (couldn\u2019t believe how warm for how relatively thin the Qaras is) AND stylish (yeah, I admit that the fit is important.)

                "review_body": "I've been using this jacket daily for about 1.5 weeks. I've used it as a casual jacket to wear everyday, during light aerobic activity, and in the elements around Washington state. I'm 6'2\" 170 lbs and the medium fits me very well. It would be a tight fit to wear more than a single layer underneath this jacket. The jacket weighs 1 lb 14 oz or 850 grams.\n\nPositives:\nGreat fit\nSolid build quality and high quality material selection\nLong pockets that can be used with a backpack waist belt but comfortable in normal situations\nLong armpit zippers for great ventilation\nExcellent breathability\nGood adjustability. 3 sets of cordlocks allow you to adjust the waist, hood height and hood circumference for a tight fit.\nLooks really great, the lines and accent colors (mine was dark blue with orange accents) are an excellent touch.\n\nNegatives:\nUncomfortable seam along the armpit and upper arm. Not bad with long sleeves underneath but in a t-shirt it can be uncomfortable.\nHeavy compared to a fleece insulation layer + rain jacket.\n\nUses:\nI wore the jacket in ~50\u00b0F weather with a t-shirt on underneath. I was sitting outside for about 2 hours and was not moving around much. I was starting to get cold but it was manageable.\n\nI wore the jacket in ~40\u00b0F weather with hard rain and wind for several hours while staying active. I wore a long-sleeve wicking layer underneath. The rain soaked through the jacket after about 90 minutes which isn't unexpected, not many clothes can handle heavy rain for that long. I remained warm and the cordlocks on the hood helped to make a tight seal to not let any additional rain in. It held off the rain better than my Marmot rain jacket does.\n\nI wore the jacket on a short jog in ~50\u00b0F weather. I was warm but didn't need to open the underarm vent zippers. The breathability of this jacket is really impressive. If I were wearing my fleece and rain jacket I would have been much hotter. It's clear that a lot of thought and effort has gone into making this softshell breathable. This jacket should easily be able to handle freezing temperatures if you're active.",

                "review_body": "I grew up in Nebraska and spend 17 (too many) years there.  I've been through harsh winters.  But I don't remember them at all.\n\nI've lived in tropical climates for the past 12 years and am currently in North Carolina.  Winters here sit at a regular low in the mid 20s; we usually get highs into the high 40s, maybe the low 50s even. Suffice to say, I'm spoiled.\n\nI ordered this jacket to survive this winter, which is promising to be a cold one.  Middle of December and it's already dipping into the 30s! Brrrr!  And survive this jacket will do!  The \"high loft fleece\" layer is relatively thin, which keeps this jacket nice and light, but it also keeps me warm.  I've worn it outside walking the dog (who, at 5 AM, feels as if she must investigate every blade of grass in the neighborhood) when it was close to 0C outside (see what I did there?  Tricked you!  Kept you on your toes!) and I was fine.\n\nWind does not penetrate this jacket at all.  The hood is snug enough that you don't create a small wind tunnel around your head like jackets that are designed to be worn with a helmet; another benefit to the hood is that it's not designed to be removed, which always leaves gaps in the material coverage.  At the wrists is a perfectly placed piece of hook-and-loop fastener which isn't quite as strong (or loud) as Velcro, but does more than an adequate job at sealing the sleeves around a pair of gloves.  If you were active, you may be interested in unzipping under the arms to allow extra ventilation.\n\nMy only complaint with this jacket is that the pockets only have lining on one side of the inside.  You won't keep both hands warm using these pockets, only the side of your hands away from your body.  On the side your palms would sit is a mesh fabric.  This means that if you're cold outside and leave the pockets unzipped, be prepared for that inevitable breeze that hits just right to blow right through the jacket.\n\nI guess it could also use a chest pocket, but now I'm just being picky.",

So most men/women will wear an undershirt, flannel shirt, thermal undershirt, sweatshirt, or any combo of the above under this jacket.  My brother wears an X-large in any shirt or coat, and this jacket fit perfectly with room for layers.  Also, it's a nice weight without being bulky.

I'd been searching for about 3 years for a good, simple, brown jacket and my wife finally bought this for me for Valentines day and I've been thrilled ever since. It seems to be made well and is warm enough for any SoCal evening and probably good for most evenings in the Spring/Fall elsewhere.\n\nThere are only two minor criticisms:\n1) I wish it had a left breast pocket. I have another black jacket that is similar and it has this extra pocket. I find it to be extremely useful as I don't like to carry things in my jeans.\n2) The sizing seems to be a bit strange. I normally am between a medium and large (I wear a size 42S suit jacket) and with this jacket, it didn't really fit until I got the small. I think it really depends on the style and how you like your jacket to fit, but for me the sizes were just too big. Consider that before you buy.\n\nOther than that, this is an excellent jacket, thus the 4 star rating.",

I dislike the pockets and reszipping the liner into the coat is a pain.\n\nThe black lining jacket is okay, but again feels sloppy.  There's no piping or other distinguishing marks so it's just a very \"blah\" black jacket.  I definitely blend into he shadows and when it's dark out even I don't know I'm there!\n\nI didn''t get a good feel for this coat until we got colder conditions or I would have returned it.

                "review_body": "First, if you're curious how a British style waxed jacket may fair or adapt to a North American climate, just remember Filson is an American company offering similar clothing.\n\nSecond, this jacket is very well made and very comfortable. It is a touch looser than a Carhartt 2XL Detroit jacket I own, despite being marked as 3XL. If you compare measurement sizes(I suggest looking at their actual website vs sizing info here on Amazon), this won't be a surprise. But if are counting on a 3xl=3xl, you'll find your jacket is a little more fitted\\tailored than you might expect.\n\nThough I must say. It IS my best fitting jacket, and articulates well as I move around. But the downside is I cannot layer much underneath. Though with the zip in\\out vest liner, you may not need them.\n\nI purchased after thinking about buying something that starts with a B.  I'm not disappointed. This came with the the hood and a zip in liner for less money.\nHave since placed a 2nd order for a jacket for my wife as well.\n\nAll that to say... I may still buy a Barbour someday. One cannot have too many jackets, you know. ;-)",

I'm almost looking forward to a rain storm so I can test out the water repelling functionality!  Out of the box, with the liner attached, I put it on over a heavy sweatshirt, and there was plenty of room to move - very comfortable, and warm, even on a blustery cold New England day.\n\nI ordered this Feb 24.  Coming fastest shipment, it was expected March 2; it arrived Feb 28 - 2 days ahead of schedule.\n\nI will say that the zip is a bit fiddly, but, I imagine that is more a \"learning the item\" issue, rather than a defect.",

It has these scientifically made shinny over thingys inside of it that reflect the heat back onto you.  So you can stay 20% warmer then the thickets of all thick jackets.  So you are getting the warmest and thinest jacket ever made.  That is basically amazing if you ask me.  Its a little tight on the waist so it gives you incentive to eat right. hahaha, because Im not going to spend 140 on a jacket and then get fat.  So not only is this a sweet coat, but its an incentive for the rest of your life to not get too fat so u dont have to buy a new one.  Sweet, It could be the last jacket I ever buy, EVER.  Buy it now.",

This is my first softshell so I can't compare it to similar jackets, but so far it has exceeded all of my expectations. It's a bit pricier than comparable softshell jackets, but I feel the performance of this jacket is well worth the money. It allows for full movement and was obviously designed with the active sportsman in mind. Water runs right off of it and it takes a while in a good rain for it to start to hold on to any water. The omniheat definitely does its job in this jacket and has kept me warm while outside at temperatures below freezing. The collar, waist, and cuffs were all designed to keep the wind out and they do a great job of it even when I'm biking.",

The inner portion works well by itself in above-freezing temperatures. Connecting and disconnecting each part is not too complicated, though the zippers all around are not the best and I get the impression they will be the first things to fail on the coat. Fabric was caught in one of the side pocket zippers to start with and it was a challenge to fix it without tearing anything. It's made in China which is a bummer but for the price it seems to perform as well as much more expensive options. I got a size medium and it's a perfect fit (5'9, 150lbs). If you think you're between sizes, opt for the next one up. This is not a baggy or relaxed-cut coat. Overall very satisfied so far - here's hoping it lasts more than one or two seasons.",

I ordered a small because I wear small, sometimes medium sized, jackets, and based on the fit of Columbia gear I've bought in the past I thought a small would be fine.\n\nWell, when I received the jacket I found out how wrong I was.  Thus my advice to anyone looking at buying this or a similar jacket from Columbia this year is to lean towards a larger size if there is any doubt about the fit (and perhaps even if there isn't), particularly if you have much weight on your stomach.  The chest was about what I expected, but the waist and shoulders of the jacket were VERY slim.  The bottom of the jacket barely fit over my belt and the tightness in the shoulders and upper arms made me look like I was wearing a full-body cast.\n\nFit aside the rest of the jacket is pretty great.  The liner jacket is what keeps you warm and it does a very good job of that.  The shell is supple yet very resistant to the elements, so with the liner in place you've got something that is heavy-duty against both cold and inclement weather.  If the fit were looser in the upper arms and the bottom I'd give this 5 stars.",

                "review_body": "If you don't mind the crazy lining on this bad boy, it's really quite nice.\n\nSizing seems about right. I bought a 3XL, and it fits similarly to other 3XL jackets I own from other brands. It might be a hair tighter or snugger than my other 3XL jackets, but not so much that I'd recommend ordering a size up from your usual size.\n\nInterestingly, I paid about 30 dollars when I ordered mine, and the prices seem to be much higher now. Guess I snuck in at the right time and lucked out. For 30 dollars, I'm rather pleased. If I wanted to order a 3XL as of writing this review, the prices are higher ($48 or $97, depending on color). For 30 dollars, I'm pleased. For 48 or 97, I'd be less pleased.\n\nThe jacket is comfortable. It feels flexible and stretchy enough to be comfortable (as opposed to some jackets that are stiffer and less comfy). Yet it feels substantial enough to be warm. Granted, I'm writing this review in August and I live in New Mexico... so I haven't gotten to put the jacket through its paces in real cold conditions yet. But it feels like it will be quite warm. I can already tell it'll be too warm for me to wear it in summer or late spring. I might stash it in my car for my wife during those seasons just in case we run into a super-cold movie theater. But it feels too warm to get much use between from April through September, or thereabouts.\n\nDepending on whether you value fashion over functionality, the lining might be a problem for you. The lining is bananas. No other way to say it, really.\n\nWhen you click around and look at Columbia's \"Omni-Heat\" jackets on Amazon, there's a reason why they are engaging in very strategic photography. They're trying to mainly show you the jacket zipped up as much as possible, because the interior lining is bonkers. It's shiny and glittery looking. Like you're wearing one of those emergency survival blankets made of foil.\n\nOf course, if you're talking about an item of clothing meant to keep you warm, why is it a bad thing for it to employ heat-retention technology? So... I can only speak for myself, but I don't mind the lining, personally.\n\nI'm a bit of a dork. And anybody who knows me would take one look at the lining and then nod knowingly, because they know that it's probably a point of pride for me to be wearing clothes that are so functional. Anybody who doesn't know me, on the other hand, might think I'm wearing a lady's jacket (or a really flamboyant dude's jacket) if they get a good glimpse of the flashy lining.\n\nYou might need to wander away from Amazon to find better pictures of the lining, to get a better idea of whether it's a deal-breaker for you.\n\nOne thing I really like about the jacket is the sleeves. The sleeves have smaller, elastic sleeves sewn into the openings. This means that the elastic bit of the sleeve clings tightly enough to your wrist/hands to prevent too much cold air from getting in. It just looks like you're wearing a long-sleeve black t-shirt underneath the jacket, which isn't bad.",

Well made, stylish, comfortable, and each one I buy is a little better than its predecessor.  This one has extra snaps which keep the hood on better than the earlier jacket, and it has more pockets. I like it that every pocket has a zipper.  No more lost gloves in the theater or on the overhead bin on the plane. The liner zips out easily and is comfortable and warm enough for fall or spring. One more improvement in the 2019 jacket over its 2015 predecessor: North End lowered their prices.",

The description does give the color code of the jacket, however unless you\u2019re familiar with TNF\u2019s color code you wouldn\u2019t know you were ordering an all black jacket.\n\nIt was too late to send back since I was leaving for my trip so I went with it. Aside from the color issue I was very happy with the jacket. The new fabric technology seems to work just as well as goretex and I love the throw back design. I can\u2019t speak to durability as I\u2019ve only skied with it 3 days but I\u2019m very pleased with the quality. I\u2019d give the product itself 4.5 stars. I understand using a color jacket to show the design but it would have helped to include an all black jacket in one of the photos to alert and clarify the color you were ordering.\n\nShipping was also great. I sent a note and requested they send it out asap since it was scheduled to arrive the evening before I left. It arrived a day early and seemed evident they made a conscious effort on a weekend to get it shipped out to me. Very appreciative for that.",

Now then, and this is with absolute certainty, they do run big in size.

This product's outer shell material is slick/nylon and 'crinkly' noise as if it were a rain jacket so buy only if ok with these aspects.  It is slightly large / loose fitting and the hood is not collar-tuckable/hidden (most jackets aren't although hard to find).  The inner liner is removable sleeveless cotton fleece vest, I was hoping for sleeved version.  In terms of overall material quality, the outer shell I rate 6.5/10, the inner shell 6/10.  No signs of workmanship problems, it's just I expected a more durable, slightly thicker, higher quality material all around.  Risk of buying mail order clothes.  I would use jacket for rain, but is not as breathable so not otherwise.  I sue the inner vest separately as it is lightweight though.  Would I buy again?  hmmmm.",

                "review_body": "Let me say this; it is only slightly water resistant, and certainly not breathable.\n\nBought this jacket because I needed a waterproof shell when I go on rock climbing trips (which involve hiking, camping, and backpacking) and for when I go cycling in light rain. Got this jacket at a local retailer for a great deal, and was super excited to try it in wet conditions.\n\nI have to agree with another reviewer on here that claimed he got wet when wearing this jacket, and it was due to his own sweat. I experienced the same problem when I'm doing anything that causes me to perspire even a LITTLE bit. I find myself almost completely soaked when I remove my jacket after an extended length of time (45 min-2 hours). I would consider myself relatively fit, and that I don't sweat more than average. \"Sweatier\" individuals may experience this more extremely, as they're peeling off the jacket that is plastered to their skin.\n\nIn terms of water-proofing, it's only slightly better. Initial rain/moisture of any kind will run off due to gravity, and typically don't cause a problem. However, areas of the jacket that are perpendicular with gravity (such as the shoulders, hood, and certain creases in the sleeves), experience only a bit of run off leaving the water to soak into the shell. After a cold, wet day when I didn't sweat, I removed the jacket and found my arms to be slightly damp. Later that week I tested the jacket's water-resistance under the sink on the sleeve portion (for 30 seconds) and found that after most of the water had run off, there was still a damp area where water had soaked through.\n\nI'd say it's a decent jacket for the price, but certainly wouldn't purchase it again knowing that it's not water-proof and not breathable (the two main features it claims to do).\n\nDon't get caught up in the colors or the price of this jacket. There are better options and equivalent styles made by other companies.",

It ventilates very well to keep you fresh during activities and you remain fresh while moving around. In one of my trips to South Lake Tahoe it kept me dry from the snow, I had a thermal underneath it and did not feel too hot while snowboarding.\n\nI like to combine this jacket while wearing shorts with a tank top underneath and roll up the sleeves a bit. You do not get hot and it still will protect you from some wind, over all the jacket is great and very versatile. I would definitely recommend it and will purchase it again when needed, the only think I would recommend is to buy a size up if you will be using with multiple layers underneath.",

The jacket fits just like any other Columbia products I've owned (Not awkwardly fitted like the melting point jacket). This jacket fits just like the ascender jacket without the hoody. I'm 5'9 178lbs and the large fits great. It has a relaxed fit. If you want a fitted look like the model in the pic, get a medium but a medium will feel uncomfortable in the arm pit area. The large is perfect for me.\n\nUpdate\n\nI wore this outside for 30 min and it was very warm. It is very windy and cold today in Seattle area but I felt no air go through this jacket and was comfortably warm. This puts my newly acquired $130 Northface jacket to shame. I've owned a $220 NF jacket before with 800 fill down jkt and I like my new Columbia better. I find it interesting that TNF couldn't come up with an idea like omni heat.",

The stitching at the seams doesn't seem like it'll hold up over time, but it should last a couple seasons without an issue.\n\nI tested it in during a rainy morning walk and it kept me dry. Not sure how it would hold up in a downpour over long periods, but light/medium rains are no problem with this jacket.\n\nJust note that this jacket runs BIG. For reference, I'm 5'8\" and 155 lbs with athletic build. I'm usually somewhere between a small/medium depending on brand. But with this, even the XS is big on me. The XS fitment is good in the shoulders and sleeve, but there's a lot of extra room in the mid-section. Definitely good for people with bigger stomachs. I have a similar jacket made by Columbia in size medium that's smaller than this jacket in size XS.",

When I ordered, the price had increased to 176 with rebate.  I ordered thinking the lower price was gone.  A week later, the lower 169 price appeared.  Amazon wouldn't match the lower price, unless I packed it all up and returned it.  Nordstrom or Saks? --  No problem, the differential would have been returned -- with a smile.  Amazon? They told me no deal.  They still have a lot to learn about customer service.  Great product with this Manfrotto Jacket.  Everything I expected and more.  Amazon?  A total let down.  Very disappointed in them, negative 5 stars....",

The color is an approved one for work so he can wear it with his uniform. With the fleece on the inside, he finds this a comfortable and appealing layer.\n\nOn the downside, The fit is barely enough and he called this more of a large tall than an XL tall. It fits him very closely like a base layer. He could not wear this over a sweater or anything heavier than a t shirt. His primary criticism is that the zipper is very light and pulls apart very easily. The zipper teeth are small and plastic. I put it on me (it's huge on me) and the same thing happened, the zipper constantly giving way and pulling apart.\n\nWe could not think of any reason to wear this fleece side out with the smooth layer on the inside. It made no functional sense to us. We are not \"reversibility\" people so maybe that has more value to others. I would think the fleece out would pick up lint like crazy.\n\nConclusion: he will wear this over a tee and in moderate weather for rain and wind protection. Happy with the sleeve length and color. Upset about the flimsy zipper.",

He likes the zippered chest pocket and it works great for concealed carry. It's hoodless so he can use it for layering and still has this as a lighter midweight option. It has hand pockets on both sides as well and it also repels water. It's great for fall and warmer winter days and looks very nice! I would definitely recommend it!",

It's extremely soft, roomy, and comfy. I do not like jacket that feels constraining. It has a soft interior that can be worn reversed.\n\nThe size fits me perfectly. I typically wear a M size and it was spot on. The sleeves weren't even too long. I was delighted because you never know about sizing when ordering online.\n\nThis is a perfect light-medium jacket for Fall and late winter weather in the Midwest. It is now my favorite jacket. Overall, it feels like a very high quality jacket and I highly recommend it.\n\nNote: there is no hood to block the rain.",

That doesn't mean it couldn't be right for you, but I found a few flaws, to my taste.\n\nFirst, it's supposed to be reversible, but I really didn't like the feel of the nylon on my skin. Maybe if you're wearing a long-sleeve shirt? But with short sleeves it feels kind of gross as after a little time some sweat starts building up against the nylon. So, as far as I'm concerned, that's one strike.\n\nSecond, the cut seems to hang a little strange on me. Not sure what it is about my proportions, but this Nehru-jacket, collarless look just doesn't look right.\n\nThird, it is too heavy for slightly cool weather, but too light for really cold weather. It could work be a good jacket to keep in the car if you live in San Francisco. You know, you always need a jacket in the car in San Francisco. But unfortunately, not where I live. Where I live, there are only a few weeks a year where this would be the right choice. It's an awkward in-between jacket.\n\nSo I can't get on the bandwagon of good reviews for this one. It's OK and I will probably wear it a few times a year just to mix things up. But it won't be in regular rotation, unfortunately.",

It's probably a more slimming look if your not so trim and want more structure in your jacket. I've been wearing this as a layer under a bigger coat for extremely cold days.

                "review_body": "Had looked at this jacket for a late winter addition, decided to pass. When I reviewed some browsing history, seen where it was only $17...thought why not.  When it arrived, it was much heavier than expected, runs a little big for me. I usually where XL slim fit, this is not a slim fit style, so it is a bit too roomy for me around the mid section. Feel is great, sure it is going to be super comfortable, still looks great on.",

The feel of the jacket is nice to, I like the soft feel, one side is soft and plush the other has a nylon feel yet soft on the skin. One thing that did not make sense was they put a brite white tag right at the neck where most tags are, but they could have at least made the tag stylish, sense the jacket is reversible. Best thing to do is just cut off the tag. The warmth of the jacket is just right for Southern California.\n\nIf you find this review helpful please press the helpful button, thanks!",

The zippers are well made and don't get caught in the pocket liners, or jacket liners.  The interior is completely, even the sleeves, fleece lined because you can flip this coat inside out. The puffy portion then becomes the inside.  Inner pockets are not zip close but opened.  When the fleece side is worn out then its exposed pockets are zip close as well.  I am 5'9\" 180lbs (female) with an athletic build and the Men's Medium fits me wonderfully.  It looks like a stole some nice guys coat but its very comfortable and warm.",

So far this jacket is handled numerous trips outside for camping and hiking and temperatures well below freezing. The jackets office in credibly. The polyester outer shell does a tremendous job at keeping you warm and dry on the inside. Typically when outside I wear the black color jacket showing on the outside. The pockets Friday ample storage and a great place to keep my hands warm if need be. The lighter gray side is also equally warm and dry., But it does tend to get dirty relatively easy, so I just Generally  reserve the side For more casual situations. This jacket looks great with a pair of hunting pants out of the woods all day, as well as it does with a pair of khakis or slacks going out to a nice dinner with friends or family. I wanted the large size wanting  some room to layer clothes underneath. But overall I found it to be very true to size. And I am extremely happy with it so far.",

The arms run a bit wider as well.  A XLT is a bit big in the torso but the right length on a 6ft 1 inch 165 pound young adult with long arms but who is slender .  On a 5ft 10in, 185 lb guy with large shoulders and arms it fits well across the torso and body w with only a t shirt underneath but is a tad long. He normally wears an XL jacket but has a sweater or sweatshirt on underneath, no room in this jacket. The extra width in the arms comes in handy if your arms are more muscular.\n\nThe weather cannot be too cold but nice to have on hand for the spring and colder summer nights.  And , a refreshing change to constantly wearing sweatshirts and hoodies.  The color is great which matches  most clothing.",

Not only is it warm but it also allows the wearer the freedom of movement needed during outdoor activities like skiing or snowboarding:  Unlike lesser jackets, the waist doesn't ride up if you lift your arms above your head.\n\nThe Omni Heat + goose down combination is extremely effective.  I truly doubt anyone could ever feel cold while wearing this jacket.  I've even held my arm under a running tap to test the waterproofing; it passed with flying colours.\n\nMy only minor gripe about the jacket is its length.  I'm 6'4\" so I wish it were just a little longer.  For people who are less tall, the length should be perfect.\n\nIn summary, if you're looking for the best jacket available for outdoor sports, save yourself some time and just buy yourself this Columbia.",

The width (girth) of the jacket seems a little big, if you are between sizes or unsure, go with the smaller size.\n\nConstruction - Seams seem good, and the jacket is well constructed of robust fabric that seems to be ubiquitous on soft shells.

Unfortunately I got this jacket towards the end of the winter season, so I did not get to test it in any sub-zero conditions, however I used it often when it was 15-35 degrees, and was quite comfortable in it. If you are somewhat active when wearing this jacket, then I do not think it will be a problem keeping you warm. However, if you are standing perfectly still (say, hunting for example) then as your body cools off, you may be slightly chilled. The hood is too big for a normal head, but I suppose its designed to work with a ski helmet. However, there is a nice velcro on the backside of the hood which allows you to sinch the hood down a bit and make it reasonable fit a head without a helmet. Also, the hood isn't insulated (thin), but it is waterproof. Also, I got a medium, as most things medium fit me at 5'8\" and 165lbs, athletic, and this fits as expected.",

                "review_body": "I returned it.\n\nThings I liked:\n\nSize: The size was ok, I'm a fairly big guy (6'3\" 225 lb) and a Large fit me ok. I don't lift weight though. No V shape.\n\nBlue: I liked the blue. Not sure why the other person who left a review complained about it, its very obvious in the picture. Why would you buy it if you  didn't like blue.\n\nThe things I *didn't like* about it are:\n\nFabric: Its not a thin windbreaker jacket, its a fairly thick all artificial material rain jacket, the fabric makes noise when you wrinkle it or move, I felt that when I was walking it was going to be annoying. The whole jacket feels stiff. Like a straight jacket adn I didn't feel it was going to 'wear in' as its all man made and too thick to fold. It would be fine if you live in a rainy climate and protection is more important than style.\n\nHood: The hood is permanantly attached. Not a deal breaker but I didn't anticipate wearing it in the rain that much, it was mostly supposed to be a Fall and Spring jacket for me. The hood itself is nice and it fit my head nicely. Not too big. Again, I liked the blue.\n\nZipper: The zipper seems cheap with small teeth that I felt they were going to break with repeated use. Even zipping it up a couple times made me feel like I was damaging the teeth. Like they weren't aligned correctly, but they were of course. For a weather jacket the teeth should have been bigger and given the jacket a secure feel.\n\nFlap: The the zipper has a top to botton flap that seals with a few velcro patches. You can see in the picture, it gives the jacket a sealed look covering the zipper. The flap gets in the way of trying to zipper up. The top part has a spread collar style and it was hard to zip all the way up and I found I was already fighting with the coat to get the velcro on the flap to line up. The spread collar aspect also creates an odd have open half closed feel to the top of the neck area that I didn't like. Like they were trying to design it to be open and closed at the same time... and failed. Its better zipped all teh way up with the flap closed but I didn't think I was going to be wearing it that way all the time so it failed the casual jacket test.\n\nSleeves: There is a velcro adjustment band on the sleeve ends. It just seemed poorly designed. I have long arms and the sleeves were adaquate, though not long. As long as I didn't have to raise my arms up they were going to be fine. Better than most sleeve lengths for a Large.",

The fit was good.\n\nI really like the color of this jacket and being a Hokie fan, the reversible to Orange would have made that color actually a little useful as well. It fit well and was relatively comfortable.\n\nMy big problem though, is in the look of it. For years I had settled for clothes that didn't look or fit perfectly but were reasonably priced. I have a different standard now and this just didn't meet it.\n\nI personally am not a fan of the external material. I don't know anything about it, but it's shiny and seems to hold creases.\n\nThe worst part for me though was the arms. They have a larger diameter giving me, what appear to be, really fat arms. I think I saw another person use the word 'poofy' which is exactly right. The \"Erin Garments\" jacket that I like is relatively tight to the arms and you can see a gap between the elbow and torso when your hands are in your pockets. But this jacket made me look like a a big, burgundy marshmallow.\n\nA year ago I may have just sucked it up and been content with it. But I couldn't do it and had to return this.\n\nI got this jacket after being VERY happy with another bomber, the \"Erin Garments Padded Bomber Jacket\" here on Amazon. It doesn't have as many colors but I'd recommend taking a look at it.",

I just received this jacket today and, I don't know, maybe I was lucky, but my jacket looks great! It fits perfectly and has none of the issues raised in other reviews. I don't know why that is, but I would definitely buy this jacket again, and I'm sorry I jumped the gun to buy another at a higher cost without first seeing this jacket for myself.

Lightweight, well fitting jacket, that is just warm enough that you don't want to remove it when you jump into your car, or enter your office, and warm enough to defend against the chill factor. I have looked at umpteen jackets, shells, etc. This is simply the best. Almost feels like the degree of warmth varies based on the weather outside. I think I will be wearing this in 10 out of the 12 months in the year..",

Luckily Amazon had it posted and I bought it again.  This jacket is so lightweight and warm.  It's got to weigh like 3 or 4 ounces.  Well maybe not that light, but you can barely tell you have it on.  Wind protection is fantastic.  It's very packable.  I can roll it up into a small ball that fits into my hand.  It has the Omni-Shield silver lining which \"does\" help to keep me warm in the Colorado winters.  It can be too light if the temp is too cold and you have wind and snow.  Otherwise, I wear this thing all the time.  The hood is nice but there is no way to secure it around your head (no drawstring).  Overall - excellent jacket.  Very versatile. Great price.",

When the Columbia Men's Trail Fire Windbreaker arrived, not only was it tissue paper thin, but it was so small, I couldn't even get it on. The label read Medium, but it certainly was not Medium. I returned it for credit. It took many emails with the company asking for my email, before I finally understood that Amazon.com strips out any email in all correspondence, so if this happens to you, give you email, but put a dash or something other than the @ symbol. I have no idea why Amazon.com would strip away the email between a customer and one of their companies, but they do. Once they finally got my email straight, they send me a return authorization immediately. Some weeks later, and after the credit did not appear on my credit card for the return, I had to file another return with Amazon.com to get them to respond. Now, at last, they have credited my credit card, but not for the full amount. Only the windbreaker charge was credited. I didn't get credit for the Sales Tax I had to pay. I notified Amazon.com that the Sales Tax was not refunded, but I got the standard response from one of their computers. So beware. Not all Amazon.com products are what they appear to be.",

The Large was just fine!\n\nThe zip-in feature (like most of the upper-end jackets have nowadays) is great. Living in Florida, I can use it as a rain jacket most of the year, then zip-in the fleece for a colder weather jacket for the few months I need it. The breathability of the jacket is amazing. I never get sweaty wearing it when it warms up a little (or I warm up a little) and it has the zippable armpit areas for extra breathability.\n\nThe jacket is very waterproof and the hood will stay flipped up, if you will, to allow the water coming down the hood to run off the side, rather than in your face over the front of the hood. Handy feature when it's raining or there is a tropical storm...\n\nOverall, great jacket for the price. I hope to have mine for a long time!",

There is only one pocket on the front. Now if you are planning to use this and you are an extreme outdoors person then this is a great jacket.

Ever since I bought it, the weather where I live has been in the negative. The Omni-heat inside of the coat has kept me warm even with just wearing a short sleeve shirt. The Omni-tech on the outside of the coat has been excellent repelling rain, snow and ice while the water-tight zippers keep the moisture from entering inside the jacket. The hood fits over helmets for skiing and snowboarding. The cuffs are velcro and adjustable. It is very light-weight and durable. It has two zippers on the main zipper so when it gets too hot on the slopes, you can just zip the bottom one to cool down without having to unzip the whole jacket.\n\n  It's the best Columbia jacket I have ever owned and I've owned 8 Columbia jackets now. I feel like the sizing is right on for me, but I guess it depends on what you do and how many layers you plan on wearing underneath. I doubt you will need to wear multiple layers because of how warm the coat will keep you even with just a long sleeve shirt underneath. I highly recommend this jacket!",

I've worn it on a few winter hikes in NH and my only complaint is that the zipper tends to jam. I talked to Columbia about this problem and they advised me to buy some zipper lubricant and try that. The zipper lube improved things enough that I'll keep the jacket but my confidence in it is a little shaken. It's not good when you have to take your gloves off and use both hands to finish zipping your hard shell. If it weren't for the zipper problem this would be a 5 star shell.\n\nSizing: I usually wear a medium jacket but I ordered this in large because I tend to wear it over multiple fleece layers. When I'm layered up it fits pretty good. The arms are a little long but that doesn't really bother me.",

Also, there's hardly any fill in the arms.  The jacket would be fine if the temps are 30-40 but I wouldn't recommend it in colder temps unless you layer up.  I tested it out in below zero temps and felt the cold coming through.  I ended up returning this and getting the Spyder Dolomite Hoody instead, which is super warm compared to this jacket.",

It is a breathable, form fitting jacket great for cold windy days.  Once you get colder than 30 degrees fahrenheit you will probably need an additional layer below, or a heavier jacket.  Also, water resistance is minimal.  Do not wear this jacket in significant rain.  A mist is fine, as the jacket has some water resistant properties, but the approach for this jacket is breathability over protection from the elements.\n\nFit:  I am a 5'10\" male, 160 lb who wears almost exclusively medium clothing.  This jacket, like all other Salomon apparel I own, fits perfectly.\n\nStyle:  One of my favorite features of this jacket is the look.  I own the black jacket with red zipper and it is one of the best looking jackets I have ever seen.\n\nBottom Line:  If you want to look good, stay relatively warm, and not be bogged down by heavy clothing, I fully recommend this jacket.",

This is a jacket, not jersey and I think it is not unreasonable to want to wear a baselayer underneath.  As is, the arms are not long enough.  The chest/shoulders are too restrictive, and the front is not long enough--looks ridiculous.  I would have exchanged it for an XL but I'm done with Gore--I will stick to Pearl Izumi for my gear.",

After obsessing for a couple of days I went with the XXL based on the sizing chart on the Gore website and off of a few reviews I found on the web.  When I got it the chest seemed a little bigger than I expected, but the sleeve length was just right.  Thought about returning it for an XL, but I was afraid the sleeves might be too short.  Turns out the extra fabric in the chest is not a problem at all with just a jersey underneath, and will probably be a benefit if I want to layer it over something warmer.\n\nHighly recommended.",

Even cycling below freezing, when using layers this jacket is component to a superior system. During the early winter and late fall, it can be below 40 when I start my ride but heat up to the 50s.

                "review_body": "This is a good jacket for its intended use that is built to last. It's not the lightest and smallest but compresses down to easily fit in a jersey pocket (but don't plan on anything other than your house key in with it). The windstopper fabric reduces wind chill about 95%, and, even without any vents, the material is remarkably breathable so you aren't marinating in your own juices at the top of a climb. I can adequately regulate temperature by slightly opening the zipper pulling up the cuffs a bit (cuffs have both elastic and velcro so comfortable and will stay put). I wouldn't want to depend on this jacket in an extended downpour, but it has kept me dry in occasional showers and on a long ride in mist and drizzle on the Blue Ridge Parkway.\n\nIt's a good fit for general cycling but not super form fitting; however, this allows adequate room for layering and year-round use and it's comfortable off and on the bike. I'm 6', 175 lbs and find the large true to size with adequate length in the sleeves and tail. I can wear it over my soft-shell cycling jacket in winter but it isn't excessively loose over just a summer jersey. There is some wind noise on the descents but it doesn't puff up like a parachute. Another good example of quality and versatility I've found in most of the Gore Bike products.",

I used it in iceland in late November as the only layer over the shirt. The temperatures touched - 5 degree C. But the jacket kept me warm even I was out in the cold at night for hours.

                "review_body": "I've been wearing this for about a week now, which is not long enough to provide a thorough review, but seeing as how no one has reviewed it yet I thought I'd get some early info out there for anyone considering purchasing this jacket.\n\nI've been wearing it in mid-40's and windy weather all week... and it has done the job completely. It appears to be sufficiently warm and completely breaks the wind. One challenge with any down fleece is you can't get them super wet, so you definitely don't want to be stuck in a situation where this will be your only cover in a steady rain. The four pockets are handy (and warm) and the fabric extensions on the sleeves add warmth and cover those spots that are usually left exposed while wearing gloves. The zip up collar does well at protecting the neck and is not uncomfortable at all.\n\nWhen going indoors it is a must to remove it because you would overheat otherwise, but the light weight and compressibility of this jacket makes it easy to stuff into a pack or bag. It can be compressed to about the size of a football, but at less weight. Wearing while unzipped does a fair job of releasing the heat.\n\nI like the fit of this jacket... I wear medium and this appears to be true to size. It is a snug fit for my slim frame and does not look like one of those overly puffy jackets. The fabric is a matte finish, rather than the shiny finish in other brands.\n\nWhile I have been evaluating the warmth of this jacket during a trip to Vancouver, BC, the real test will come next month while in Alaska. I'll update my entry after that.\n\nUPDATE - 1/4/13\nI did have a chance to wear it in Alaska in December where it was between 1 and 20 degrees.  I had to have a couple of layers on underneath, and then of course a warm hat.  But it was fine (no wind).  Later, while skiing in Washington in January at 25 degrees, it served as a good insulator beneath my Columbia shell. It has a different zipper system than the shell so it did not zip in, but that was not a big deal.",

The omni heat system (little reflective metallic dots) really seems to work well. The jacket does a good job of protecting you from the wind, once the bottom is cinched in and the fit was comfortable without making me look like the Stay-Puft man. I'm around 6'3\" and 170 pounds with long arms. I bought the large after reading other reviews and it fit with nice length to the arms and torso.",

I would suggest buying a size smaller than you normally would and it will still be plenty big to wear a T-shirt and hoodie underneath. I wore this coat in temperatures ranging from 30 to -6 ( actual temp without wind chill), and I was toasty warm for a few hours of light walking with quite a bit of standing around. Would highly recommend this for anybody who wants a good winter jacket without too much bulk. Also love the detachable hood and lots of nice lined pockets. I orders the Mystery color which is a steel blue and black..looks awesome! For the price you are getting a great looking, quality winter coat!",

The pockets were lined with a nylon that snagged the skin on my hands and actually hurt in the cold weather.\n\nThere is an insulated hood on the jacket (without a place to stow it when not needed) with chin strap but I couldn't figure out how to tighten it around my head and needed a free hand to hold it closed.\n\nIf it hadn't cost me so much to return, I would not have kept it.

The Antimony III specs are similar to this jacket, but the PTA-II runs a tad smaller and feels lighter. I generally wear a large, but this coat feels oversized. However, with a layer, such as a thick sweater, it fits better. The Antimony III ran quite large as well and I decided to wear medium. This worked well, but layering was a chore. The 150 grams of synthetic insulation should bode well for NYC winters and water repellant fabric is a well known feature for Columbia's coats and jackets. Pockets are plentiful on the outside of the jacket with a small zipped chest pocket, two handwarmer pockets, and two large storage pockets. There is an interior pocket on the inside of the jacket, but is the only one which is a bit disappointing. The storage pockets, cuffs, and placket over the zipper close with snaps which I prefer to Velcro but some others may not. The hood is large, insulated, and adjustable with integrated lines. It zips off if you prefer the jacket without it. I'm expecting a similar level of performance from this jacket as I did the last. The Antimony III was comfortable with minimal layering down to the 20's for me. I hope that improved capacity for layering with this jacket with surpass those temperatures.

What he likes is the warmth with out the puffiness.  It's also great because it's water and wind resistant.  I was ok with the price. I had just returned a coat I bought for him at a local store which is a national chain store and took it back after\n1 week.  The coat that I purchased for $70.00 was loosing it's stuffing.  So that is why I looked at Columbia.  For 30.00 more I got him a better quality coat that will hopefully last him through two growing seasons.",

It has a slim fit so size up if you are unsure.\n\nI would pick this over a gore tex jacket if you can find a good deal. If they are the same or close enough in size, I'd go with gore-tex.\n\nOverall very good though designed for hiking and mountaineering more than going to the grocery store. This is why there are 2 chest pockets on the outside and no side hand pockets (where your hip belt would go from your pack).\n\nHelmet compatible, but can also be used without a helmet.",

                "review_body": "After way too much time shopping around the internet and comparing features, I chose to order the Columbia \"Tree Grinder\" jacket over all the other options. I've only had the jacket about a week, but so far, this thing is seriously delivering on every front. Let me tell you some background: I live in one of the top three rainiest cities in the United States. I'm talking over 120+ inches/year. I do not own a car, but commute on my bicycle, everyday. This jacket is 100% WATERPROOF. I took it out of the box, rode down the street, and literally stood in the pouring rain, just to test it out. If any moisture made it through, I would have returned the jacket right away, but my upper half was powder dry. The thick outer fabric is windproof, too. The jacket is loaded with features, like waterproof pockets galore, double zippers in the front, fully adjustable billed hood, adjustable cuffs with extra length at back of hands (which can roll up to create a gutter that diverts water away from hands), ultra-futuristic NASA style reflective inner lining (Omni-Tech)... all kine stuff. I believe the design is geared towards snowboarders, as there is also a powderskirt and buttons to attach to pants. The bottom line is, you absolutely will stay dry in this thing. If I have any gripes, it it is only that breatheability is only so-so with the zippered armpit vents; and because it is a shell jacket, it runs pretty large to accommodate further layering.  But, I am talking about wearing a snow jacket in a tropical rainforest climate, so maybe you will appreciate the extra warmth. It never really dips below 60 degrees here, so I haven't had to wear any extra insulating clothes underneath the jacket. The materials are very nice, construction seems much sturdier than some of the Columbia jackets in the lower price range, and the styling is unique. Again, it does run a bit large, in my opinion, but the extra length just means that more of you is shielded from the elements. All in all, a great coat, and I highly recommend it.",

                "review_body": "I have one of the Bajas from OR and two of these pullovers from HH and I really like all three of them. They fit on and off easily with a quality side zipper and they keep me warm down to 30 degrees F. It might work in colder but I've never had to try that (thankfully). I prefer the HH pullover because it is not as puffy as the OR Baja and also because it has two zip pockets instead of the OR kangaroo/sweatshirt type hand pocket. The HH also lays nicer on the body. Both fit about what I expect and both have decent hoods, too. The HH hood doesn't have an adjustment point though and this really needs to be upgraded. Now, you have to zip it up the middle all the way for the hood to stay in place and there are times when you want the hood stable and not zipped up all the way so please add an adjuster to the next version, HH! Otherwise, this thing is perfect and basically is the nicest sweatshirt I've ever seen. I have it in black and in orange, by the way. The orange is called 'bright orange' and it is bright but its not a neon orange or anything odd looking like that. Its quite nice really and my go-to piece for basically any cold day activities.  P.S. I bought mine on sale prices better than Amazon and directly from Helly. Hope that helps.",

I planned to layer underneath, but this is like a heavy shell, not a puffy poly fill jacket. Hopefully the Omni-heat works as advertised. Lots of great pockets and hooks. A fisherman probably designed it. The jacket length is cut short, not sure why- maybe it's to keep it out of the water?? But that means it looks funny as a street jacket. Sleeves and chest fit great. Hood has elastic in the cap- great idea, but the fabric up the neck is a little short which pulls down on the back of the cap. I'm 6'3\" 205lbs and I got the XL Sage color. Overall solid Columbia quality as usual. More colors would be good, like dark blue or olive - black is a weird color for a fishing jacket.",

Yes it does have some fluff to it so I cannot say it completely flat, still it is not very puffed up either so its alright. Wrangler is a great company so I know the quality in the seams and fabric are there, but they did cheap out in the insulated department. Overall it does keep you Simi warm, the only downfall it has is the inside is not lined; So therefore you have the same material that is on the outside of this jacket on the inside as well, even the pockets have that same \"outside fabric\" inside them. The medium does fit him pretty well, for reference my husband is 5'11, 160lb with wide shoulders. Still I do recommend as this jacket is very nice.",

It slides on without the resistance of the jacket it is replacing which had a cloth interior that would pull rather than slip when putting it on.\n\nThis jacket is light weight, not very thick, and feels quite comfortable. I also like the length because I often wear shirts that are not tucked in. This jacket is just long enough to fully cover my shirts.\n\nThe side pockets are zippered which is great because they are secure from things possibly falling out. Additionally the pockets are not shallow.\n\nThis is a cool weather, not a cold weather, jacket which is perfect for me. We live in an area where the daytime temps rarely drop below 40 degrees. The sleeves have a soft elastic around the wrist which isn't too tight but will keep the wind out. There are drawstrings around the bottom of the jacket which I'm not likely to use but some others might.\n\nThe only thing I don't like is the \"stand up collar\"  which tends to touch my cheeks when the jacket is not fully zipped up. Perhaps the collar will not stand up after some use, or I could put a stitch in it to keep the collar down. I don't think the stand up collar is needed on a jacket of this temperature range.\n\nBeing water resistant is also perfect for me as this city does not usually receive hard rain.\n\nI highly recommend this jacket.",

It's not thin, this jacket is definitely on the fuller, puffy side. Full thicker collar for neck warmth. Strong zipper with a good zipper pull.\nThe hand warmer pockets are good sized, not lined.\nNo interior pockets, which is surprising. Not a deal breaker but worth mentioning.\nPolyester to repel weather.\n\nMy son really likes this jacket. He lives in the city and does a lot of walking; it gets cold here and so far this has been a warm and all the pockets make it a very useful jacket. Looks good, too!",

This does keep me very warm on those colder days outside with it's warm insulation design without being as bulky as my super thicker winter coat. I like that the pockets have zippers so that if I need to place phone or keys in those pockets I have the option to zip it up to ensure they will be secure. I also like the vertical zip pocket on the chest area of the jacket so I can put my keys in there and still have the lower pockets available for my hands.",

The Compounder is about 19 oz. compared to their best choice the Arcteryx Alpha SV which is 2 oz. less and $300 more!  Later, I saw the Compounder was highly rated by Backpacker magazine.\n\nThe breathability is nearly as good as some fabrics that cost much more.  Unfortunately, I am aware of that...\n\nThe XXL is true to size and a relaxed fit with long arms leaves plenty of room for winter layering. The Compounder has an easy-to-adjust hood; soft face lining; and internal mesh pockets handy for storing gloves.\n\nWhile waterproof pocket zippers all run smoothly, the main zip requires wrestling.\nThe pit zips are very long...\n\nThe Compounder maybe a tad heavier than $600 jackets, but the result is that it offers multisport potential: It crosses over into skiing and mountaineering, yet it\u2019s not too heavy for backpacking.\n\nA great product from Columbia.

Pocket for phone was nice, along with goggle pocket (used for gloves).  Seems durable, no tears from rubbing on trees or branches so far.  Fairly lightweight, warm, breathable, sleeves are nice with stretch cuffs under gloves, also powder skirt seemed to work.  Did not use hood, or try with helmet.  \"reflective\" shiny stuff inside seems like a joke, it is just paint or ink dots on inside fabric... either way it was warm.",

I would have preferred a different color than Black, but it was too good a price to pass up.  It's still September in Southern California, so I won't be able to comment on its utilitarian properties until my ski trip in January, but there are plenty of other reviews on the subject.\nBack to the sizing.  I'm 6-0\", 207 pounds, 44\" chest, 37\" waist, and 33\" sleeve length.  The Large was definitely the best fit on me.  The shoulders fit fine, and there was still an extra inch or two available in the sleeve length if needed.  I was able to readily swing my arms around without any restriction in my motion.  There's still room for some layering underneath (e.g. silk undershirt and fleece jacket).  Other reviewers commented on how warm this jacket is, so I doubt you'll need too much layering ... but all bets are off if you layer like the Michelin Man.\nUntil I actually ski in this jacket in cold and wet conditions, my 5 star rating is conditionally based on the 70% discount price I paid.  Otherwise, the sole purpose of this review is to provide readers additional sizing feedback.",

You can wear it with just a shirt on underneath and you are good to go when the temp is as low as 35 degrees. Since I have to work in temperatures as low as 20 degrees, just layer a thin garment underneath. I have not had a chance to play golf with it yet, since most people don't play when it's snowing. I am sure it will perform just as well. I have never paid this much for a jacket before. It is worth every penny.",

For that reason I believe he is actually a paid reviewer and I will counter his review.\n\nIn his review he mentions key features in a positive manner. Those features are true to the product, however, the jacket is not insulated in any way whatsoever. Its basically a durable shirt. Also, the entire back of the jacket is not G-1000 material, which is nothing more than tightly woven polyester by the way, but the parts that are not G-1000 are a thin spandex material that you would see common underwear made of. Its about as thick as underwear too.\nThe jacket is very well tailored and has nifty designs in places that make it a really good jacket.\nBut in conclusion, the materials its made out of is just low frequency polyester and a thin layer at that. It is not water resistant at all. I have the entire Keb outfit. Its good for wind protection but in rain it soaks up water like a sandman. This jacket is NOT worth anything more than 180$ in the market compared to other jackets made with the same amount of material.\nThat being said, if you're willing to pay the price like I did, thats your personal right.",

                "review_body": "Fjallraven makes great outdoor gear, that's all there is to it.  I love this jacket, but a few items to note if you are considering one:\n\n1.  The torso and arms are generous, so it fits more like a \"tall\" size.  Love it for me, but that may not be good news for you depending on your preference.\n2.  This jacket will resist drizzle, but it is not a rain jacket.  The G-1000 material on the hood, shoulders, lower sleeves, and lower torso can be easily treated with Greenland wax and can be highly water resistant; however, the other panels are a much stretchier material.  I treat the G-1000 with wax, then treat the stretchy panels with Nikwax or Cabela's waterproofing spray.  It will do great in anything but a sustained downpour.\n3.  The hood is substantial.  This is great news for wind and the elements, but can take a little getting used to.  Depending on how it adjusted, it can be configured to be a limited-vision tunnel that stands well out in front of your face.  Fortunately, it is highly adjustable, including the ingenious use of a flexible wire inside the front of the hood that can be shaped.\n4.  The jacket is a little lighter weight than it appears.  It's no warmer than a standard soft-shell, but far more durable and functional.  The jacket has a trim but not slim fit, so room for layering underneath.\n\nI have received so many compliments on this item!  It really stands out in a good way.",

Very disappointing as I thought I was getting a great deal paying $25 for a $140 price-tagged jacket. Well, I learned it wasn't worth 25 cents to me. I'm a bit UA fan but avoid this product.",

This will be a nice hiking jacket for the mountains of AZ in the fall. The blue isn't too bright but is it enough to get noticed on the trail if you want to be seen when hiking in a large group. The thickness is roughly the same as a Polartec 100 level. Though I think this jacket is more dense than that. Four stars - instead of five - due to the length of the sleeves. I like the thumb-hole option but I don't like having the sleeves bunched up so much if I choose not to wear it like that.\n\nI can't say I'd give 4 stars for the posting. It did post \"Dry Clean only\" but that may have been due to a previous review (do your research). I washed and dryed this jacket as instructed on the tags and all came out fine. Plus, the photos didn't show how the material was textured inside and out for a better idea of what you're buying.\n\nIf the red jacket was available, I would purchase on a marked down price. I'm not sure this jacket is worth more than $60.",

I totally believe the design came from the UK with all the adjustment straps and inner and outer zippered pockets (even a pen holder). It has just as many features as a $200 Patagonia. Only time will tell if it holds up, but upon first impression, it seems even better made than jackets by Columbia, North Face or Bauer, at least on their lower end. It's not too heavy or insulated, but I wouldn't wear it on a summer hike. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because the zipper is left-handed. I don't know if that has anything to do with it's English design, but I find it a bit cumbersome. Recommended though.",

                "review_body": "This jacket was more than I expected and maybe even a little more than I had hoped. I really needed a rain jacket to use with my down jackets and coats. It needed to fit a little loosely so that I wouldn't have any problems with it crushing the down and losing the insulating value of it. I also wanted something that would breath and not break the bank. A hood was also very important and pockets. This was the best I could find that included ALL of those features. First the pluses: 1, the fit is almost perfect for me and for layering. I really could have gone with a large instead of an extra large, if I only wanted to use it for mild temperatures. 2, The looseness also helps in the breathing category because it doesn't completely trap the air and moisture released from the body inside the jacket until your clothing becomes saturated and starts to rob your body of heat. Yes it says that the fabric is breathable, but even the most expensive \"breathable waterproof fabrics\"  have this problem. 3, The hood is more than I had hoped for. I knew that it zipped off, which is important and which I like but the adjustment cords are very good too. I was a little concerned when I first put it on and tried to snug it down with the two side cords, and they didn't do much. Then I realized that I hadn't done anything with the cord on the back of the hood. It's a system and you need to use all of them to get it really snugged down. There is also a stiffener in the brim of the hood that keeps the hood out further from your face and stops rain or snow (To a degree. Nothing stops horizontally driven stuff. lol) from getting on my glasses. 4, Pockets. Lots of pockets. Two large pouch/cargo pockets on the outside front with Velcro flaps, Two hand warmer pockets BEHIND those (I'll get to that in a minute.), one chest pocket with a zipper on the wearers top left outside and one chest pocket with Velcro on the top right inside. Now the negatives. 1, It's a lot heavier than I really wanted. Solider, rugged and well made. I was hoping for something that \"could be\" easily carried in or on a backpack. This is rather bulky and heavy for that. In certain situations I certainly \"might\" strap this on top of my pack. It is definitely lighter than my mountain parka soft shell (Which cost about 3 to 4 times what this did.), but that is for expected bad weather in more extreme environments. I was looking for those swing season, I never expected THAT to happen situations where I needed something better than the fits in your pocket rain coat. 2, The hand warmer pockets BEHIND the pouch/cargo pockets on the lower front. Here's the problem. The opening into these is only as wide as the pockets are tall. The pouch/cargo pockets will hold quite a bit, but they are not all that deep. My bare hands fit in just fine, and with a pair of light gloves on They will still fit, BUT if you have on anything that has some real insulation, you CAN NOT GET YOUR HANDS INTO THE POCKETS. I understand exactly why the manufacturer did it this way. It is a cost effective way for them to get a lot of pockets onto the jacket without raising the price to high. The pouch/cargo pockets are simply sewn on top of the outside of the coat on only three of the four sides. The top, bottom and inside edges are sewn and the outside edge is left open for a somewhat serviceable hand pocket underneath. Clever and cost effective, however it creates two problems. One, it is hard to get a gloved hand into the pocket and two, if you put anything of any size into the pouch/cargo pocket on top of it, it will not expand to allow use of the pocket under. 3, No pit zips. These are almost mandatory for a coat of this design. Thigh length, waterproof, heavy duty fabric, with two way zipper, Velcro storm flap over the zipper, high, stand up collar and full hood and bungie pull cords on the bottom hem to keep out the elements. It is ment to be battened down to keep out the storm, and that means trapping in the heat and sweat. 4, The zipper is on the left instead of the right side, but then this was obviously designed in Great Britain, and they even drive on the left, so what ya goin' ta do. LOL. Now that my ramble is pretty much done, I want you to know that I love this rain coat, ESPECIALLY for the price I paid for it. I can and will live with all of the negatives I listed and would have easily up my score to FIVE STARS if it had pit zips.",

I wore it for two weeks now, it has been raining a lot lately.  The material is light and the sweat wasn't trapped, body stay dry.\nThe jacket is long enough to cover to upper tight.  One thing I really like about this jacket is the pockets.  If you look closer to the pictures vendor provided, you will notice that there small pocket outside and inside for cell phone or wallet or anything for easy access.  the front pockets are large and designed to keep water from getting inside.  It even has a pen holder.  The hood is pretty large, it covers well.  You can pull the elastic band to tight up the hood so it will keep the hood from blow away from strong wind.  I hope the elastic band material will last, only time can tell.\nI wish they design it to add a down or thermal liner for winter.  Overall, nice design, great materials, I would recommend this to others who looking for a good quality rain jacket.",

With specific lighting and a little imagination, I can begin to see Navy instead of black, and I can imagine that the light red stripes match the apparent red/orange stripes in the Skog pictured.  But the picture and \"Navy\" label do not much to manage expectations.  If I did not already have nearly identical shirts, I probably would not mind.",

I am 5\u2019 10\u201d 175lbs and am between an American medium and large.  This XL allows for plenty of room for a thick sweater underneath.

                "review_body": "Bought this at an outdoor equipment store.  went straight for a XXL because I have a big chest (45\"), and I'm 6'2\" in height. It fit well but I'll have to be careful what insulation layers I put underneath. It is well manufactured with some well thought out features. The hood can become huge which no doubt is useful in certain situations. The 2 external pockets are only at chest level but have a large volume. As you would expect, there are decent features/drawcords to tighten things up around the hood, neck, wrists etc. and great ventilation zippers at the arm pit that extends quite a bit down the side of the jacket. The G-1000 fabric is really hard-wearing but require a good amount of waterproofing wax to seal you in. Soon after purchasing I was caught in a light shower and all was good. The first sustained rain I experienced wearing it, and it leaked, mostly around the seams. I have since applied copious amounts of their proprietary wax to all G-1000 sections, doubling up on the seams, to waterproof the jacket. This takes a solid 90 minutes to do and a hair-dryer to evenly distribute the wax and melt it into the fabric. I know from experience with other wax jackets that this will need to be repeated once or possibly twice per year to keep the jacket waterproofed if you use it regularly. That's is the \"caveat\" in the title. There will be on-going upkeep with this jacket that extends beyond wiping with a damp cloth, or a wash and re-seal with Nikwax products.",

I get a new contemporary parka about every ten years. I live in the Pacific Northwest and hike twice a week. I have a two year old top of the line North Face Parka... the Fjallraven is an order of magnitude better for all but a full day of heavy rain. It is some much more breathable than Gore-tex it is not funny. It is so comfortable and quiet, I frequently forget to take it off when I get home. I use it with the Keb pants, which have cargo pockets that compliment the Jacket (no pockets where the pack waist straps go). The brown open weave material is so breathable it is like not having any material holding up evaporation. But hit the blackberry patches and the lighter colored material is impervious to thorns. Pocket layout is outstanding for wearing a pack. To make the Ocher colored material more waterproof you wax it... so you can adjust the \"waterproofness\". So the range of conditions where this jacket is comfortable is really large.",

Given their choice of materials however, I will be somewhat challenged to decide when I will wear them.  Being not fully waterproof, not fully wind-proof (the stretch fabric portions), and not lightweight enough to be good for multi-day backpacking and mountaineering, they seem best suited to day hikes in cool conditions where heavy and prolonged rain won't be likely.  I have the wax, but have not yet applied it (don't know how I can get it inside of the big front pockets to the G-1000 fabric there, either).  I may try out the jacket as a ski shell this winter (not when wet snow may be falling however, or in high winds).  It's a shame that such a beautiful design is hindered by less than high-performance fabrics.\n\nAs far as size, I'm #190 and 5'11'', with large shoulders and chest.  The large was too tight across the chest to allow me to layer a fleece or light down jacket underneath, so I returned it for an XL, which seems about right.",

True to its reputation this is an awesome jacket: it fits snugly, yet offers great range of motion for the user and quality seems to be very good overall. I also like the hood which is HUGE and using a metal cord in the lining it allows you to shape it to fit. Pockets are well placed and the jacket can be opened at the sides for improved warm weather (or activity) ventilation.\n\nThe following however must be noted:\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n1.) This jacket offers virtually no insulation and must be regarded an outer layer only,\n2.) There is more stretch fabric on this jacket than G1000 and protection against the elements is accordingly,\n3.) If you are not in better than average shape this jacket will be too tight (I exercise 5 days a week and I am 6ft tall, 180lbs, 6% body fat and size Medium is perfect).\n4.) The jacket is 'Made in China'\n\nThe last point, 'made in China' is really getting to me; material costs can't be more than 2 dollars (this is just cotton and synthetics) and even factoring in supposedly high R&D costs, if you manufacture this jacket in a low cost country like China, charging this price is just TOO MUCH. Had they made it in Sweden it would still be expensive, but in China? It's nothing short of outrageous.",

Get it a size larger than usual so you will have room to layer under it, it runs small. Not waterproof but will stop wet snow and light showers, and unless your commute is very long or you are riding in a deluge you will be OK for most commuting. I love it for this purpose and use it all the time. I can't comment on other uses, but the lack of windproof-ness in back would make me hesitant to use it in the backcountry unless I had something else to wear over it. And it is pretty heavy and heavy duty, I would not want to carry it in my backpack very often but the durability is a plus for urban use.

The Five external pockets, three with zippers and two with just velcro flaps, and the three internal pockets, one zipper chest pocket, one media player pocket, and a large google pouch that i stash my hat in.\nFrom other reviews I new the liner might be an issue. This jacket would get five stars if it had the classic Columbia fleece liner. The liner is lumberjack on the outside and disco on the inside. Yes it looks like a flannel shirt, put has more of a wool feel to the material. The heat reflective interior is shiney and makes it very warm, and i would probably substitute a plain fleece jacket underneath until Minnesota hits 0 degrees ferenheit. The liner fits a bit tight in the in the shoulders and arms, i would not be able to wear a sweeter with it.",

                "review_body": "I normally don't write reviews.  However, there is a lot of misleading info in the comments that might make deciding on a purchase difficult.\n\n1) This jacket DOES have two zippers.  The inner set of zippers is used to \"zip in\" the liner.  If the liner is taken out the second zipper set is usable.  You can also un-zip the liner but keep it in the jacket.  This will give you the liner zipper, and the double jacket zipper (3 in all).  It's pretty obvious that the reason it is designed like this is to avoid putting a total of three zippers into the outer shell.  Navy issue NWU parkas have this exact same design, I'm pretty sure it;s not a flaw.\n\n2) The inner liner collar does \"pop out.\"  However, this can easily be fixed by removing the collar, washing it as instructed, pressing the collar down, and tucking it into the shell after reinstalling it.  After doing this the liner should not prevent the jacket from being zipped all the way up.\n\n3) Sizing is difficult, but you can always return.  I suggest getting the two sizes closest to you and returning the one you don't like.\n\n4) The liner does make the jacket a bit bulky, but it is extremely warm.\n\n5) The liner is not a shirt.  It is an actual zip up liner that looks like a shirt.  Whether or not you like this is up to preference.\n\nThe reason this doesn't get five stars is because:\na) I just bought it,\nb) While the liner zipper is reversible, the inner shell zipper is not.  This makes it harder to hid the left inner zipper after zipping in the liner (this would make more sense if you actually had the jacket in front of you)\nc) The hood can't be tucked into the collar of the shell.\n\nOverall, it's a good jacket and it looks a bit more fashionable than other cold weather jackets (in my opinion).  However, mileage may vary.",

I've only used the lining separate from the jacket a handful of times, but it's a great feature to have when you want it. I have nothing but good things to say about this one.",

                "review_body": "My previous Columbia jacket (Ballistic Parka shell / liner combo) is now over 15 years old and I'm sending it in for warranty repair just because the pull tab on the shell's zipper finally gave out. When temperatures were below zero for severaI weeks, not being able to zip my shell up wasn't very fun! I purchased the Back To Hells Mountain jacket so I would have a jacket while I sent my Ballistic Parka in for repair.\n\nThe Back To Hells Mountain jacket is very nice. It's not nearly as bulky as my old Ballistic Parka and is also weighs a bit less. I did find that the liner from my old jacket would NOT work with this new shell.  One side zipped in fine, but the other side, the teeth do not line up properly.  The Omni-Heat definitely works, maybe a little too well sometimes. I've found myself taking the jacket off if I'm going inside somewhere for more than 20-30 minutes or so.  The shell does an awesome job at cutting the wind and rain.  The liner leaves a bit to be desired though. I'm not a fan of the plaid design, but what really bugs me is that the zippers to zip the liner into the shell don't continue all the way up the collar of the liner. So when the liner is zipped into the shell, the collar sticks up and pokes you in the face. In the photos on the product page, the collar is tucked down. I've tried doing this, and within a few minutes of moving around or walking, they pop right back out. I've read another review where the user changed out the included liner with a Zephyr Ridge liner, which looks like the zippers go all the way up the collar on. I may look into doing this down the road, but it will make the overall price of the jacket quite a bit more.\n\nOverall, this is a great jacket for the price with only a few minor annoyances (to me anyway).  I remember paying nearly $300 for my Ballistic Parka over 15 years ago, but considering how long it lasted I think it was a pretty good deal. Hoping this one will last another 15 years!",

                "review_body": "This is my second winter jacket from Columbia and it's far superior to whatever model I had before (donated it already, so I'm not sure which one it was).\n\nPros:\n-Proper fit.\n-A good assortment of pockets located in the places I like them.  I use the front pocket with the vertical zipper all the time for my cell phone.  Jacket also has a large pouch-type pocket on the inside for glove storage, which was a requirement for me.\n-Quality zippers that are fairly easy to use even with gloves on.\n-Armpit ventilation for the outer shell.\n-Comfortable outer shell and comfortable liner.\n-The plaid liner is very comfortable.  The reflective \"disco\" inside lining is very effective at retaining your body heat; I can usually only wear the liner for brief periods.\n-Hood is comfortable and useful.\n\nCons:\n-Plaid liner jacket doesn't have standard side pockets.  Wasn't a deal breaker for me.\n-This jacket model appears to be discontinued and therefore has limited availability and correspondingly high prices now.\n\nI highly recommend this jacket if you can still find it at a reasonable price (less than $150), but if not, try to find the updated version from Columbia that is the most similar.",

                "review_body": "This jacket serves no purpose. It is too light for walking around, and not styled right for heavy activity.\n\nDespite being an Omni Heat jacket, it provides no resistance to cooler weather - and you can forget about sub freezing temps, may as well wear a poncho. The problem with the jacket is that is has no thermal break. Yes, it has Omni Heat, which is normally functional. However, because the jacket is so thin, anything cold touching the OUTSIDE of the jacket is immediately transferred to the INSIDE of the jacket.\n\nSo if you have snow on your jacket, the cold from the snow travels by conduction to the inside of the jacket and to your skin. Omni Hear works by holding in heat from convection, but does nothing for cold transferred by conduction. That cold will come from cold snow, cold rain, cold wind, cold banisters, cold shovels, cold doors, and pretty much anything with which you will have purposeful or casual contact.\n\nI can confirm the jacket is wind proof and water resistant, and breathable - but unless you're going to use this as a car coat, you will be disappointed. I bought mine during a Flash Sale, and paid significantly less than the Amazon listed price, but I still think I paid too much.\n\nYou will be cold in this jacket in any type of winter weather. I understand it may be more suited to fall. But if it's a fall jacket then why is there Omni Heat in the shell? If it is meant to be a shell under which you wear warmer clothing there are more functional and less expensive options. If you want to wear it to snow board or as a ski shell, you'll sweat. May work to toss a football around in 40 degree weather, but that is about it.\n\nUpgrading the jacket with a light layer of Thinsulate between the outer shell and Omni Heat fabric would make this a great jacket.\n\nBut if you want to walk down to the local cafe and just look good, for that it is perfect. You'll be cold while walking, but you'll look good.",

It's just a little short in front, but sleeves are a good length.  The Omni Heat material lining feels pretty soft.  It felt a little scratchy at first on the sleeves but I don't notice it as much since I've worn it more.\n\nStyle-wise I like the way it looks.  I wouldn't call it form fitting but it does have a good fit.  The collar doesn't go down well but I like how it looks up anyway.",

The outer cloth material seems to catch various pieces of lint/animal hair - which on a black jacket means you are constantly checking it. Seems to be comfortable when the weather is not windy, then when the temp drops you need to run the zipper all the way up to keep warm. A well made fleece lined jacket may be a better choice than this jacket. Probably would not have purchased it if I had gone to a store to try it on.",

The Omni heat technology is great, you can actually feel the difference between this and a normal coat. I live in upstate NY and it has been in the single digits for about a month and this coat combined with my other coat keeps me pretty warm. It is very sharp looking and is built well. I have used Columbia products for years and they all stand up well, the zippers, the material, etc. I actually have a coat I purchased in 1994 and it still is in great shape. I would recommend this jacket to everyone, and right now it's just over 100$ and for a good jacket that is unbeatable.",

Inside is a little softer than mythe other oneto and the sleeves are like silk. Can't beat it for the price.  Ended up keeping both.

Lol...otherwise the sizing is about right .. Zippered pockets that keep you warm ...front part of collar is a kinda high but its OK ...cuff things are pimp , no wind gets in...the only thing bad I can say about this coat is that it should not be worn above 55\u00b0 zippered you will get too hot very quickly...but I guess that's a good thing !

It is really lightweight, it feels slightly heavier than a fleece.  It fits him great and keeps him really warm during these crazy cold Chicago winters.  He even says that it almost keeps him too warm while he is on the train (I explained that is what the armpit zippers are for!).  The inside definitely is flashy, the silver tends to catch everyone's eyes and they ask about it.  Another thing I like about the coat is the deep pockets, so gloves wont be popping out of his pockets.  Really glad I got it for him for Christmas.",

The jacket is well made using quality materials. It's warm and keeps out the wind. The cuffs have an elastic inner sleeve to help seal off your wrists from drafts drawstrings at the waist.\n\nThe outer shell is constructed of two types of polyester; one is smooth and the other is fleece which, unfortunately, acts as a lint magnet.\n\nThe lining is also polyester but manufactured to look like a silvery mesh. I believe it's designed to reflect/retain body heat. It seems to serve this purpose but has one drawback; friction. If you're wearing a long sleeve shirt or sweater that isn't made from a very smooth fabric, your shirt sleeves will bind inside the Zephyr's sleeves when you put it on. Basically you have to grab your sleeves with your hand as you slide your arms into the jacket. Other than that, the jacket is stylish and comfortable.",

There's nothing wrong with it. It has been very warm as a mid-layer during a couple near-zero shoveling excursions this past week, and doesn't overheat me once inside and it is the top-layer. I haven't worn it in the Spring/Fall yet, but I have no reason to believe it won't work well then either.\n\nIt's as good of a full-zip lightweight fleece as you're going to find.\n\nOh, and there are pockets!

It performed great as a shell but I bought it with the hopes of \"interchanging\" with other gear.\n\nIt does have the interchange snaps in the sleeves and collar, and the extra inner zipper. On returning from my trip I ordered a Columbia Go To Jacket, which is also interchange compatible. However the zipper length is too short to reach the top of the Evergreen's collar (see picture). I called the customer support line and they first stated the Evergreen isn't interchange compatible. After getting them to look at this web page they talked with their manager and recanted their original statement, but they still couldn't give me a list of liner jackets that are known to work. Nor could they provide any indication why the zipper is too short... is the Evergreen Shell too long in the zipper, or the Go To jacket too short. So \"interchange compatible\" doesn't appear to be a claim that Columbia is willing to stand by.\n\nIt is a shame, Columbia looks like a lot of bang for the buck. But I'll stick with other brands if this is the best Columbia can do with their product and customer service.",

Unfortunately in it's 24th year it failed to keep me dry in a torrential downpour so I purchased this jacket as shown here as it's replacement.\n\nI need a jacket that offers some insulation but keeps me from overheating when I'm at work (Outdoors).\nThe jacket is very light and does not restrict my movements at all.\nThere are zippers to open vents under the arms.\nThere is an inner and outer front zipper for severe weather.\nIt is designed to allow layers underneath.\nThe jacket waist has an inner snow guard, a band that can be tightened around your waist to keep snow (or cold) from going up and under the jacket.\nSleeves can be tightened with Velcro straps around wrists.\nWhen hood is on and jacket zipped up completely it is snug around the neck and warm.\nHighly visible color pattern is attractive and functional for being seen. (good for my job)\n\nI've gotten plenty of compliments from co workers and friends whom have threatened to steal it from me jokingly. The price here at $120 can't be beat.",

I finally went to a local store that sells a lot of Columbia products and found a fleece for $55 that would work perfectly. The penny pincher in me told me to put it back and just wear one of my existing fleece jackets underneath without worrying about the zip in feature. So- I saved the $$ and walked away from it.\n\nThe shell is good- it sheds rain like a champ and is pretty wind proof. The pit zips help regulate the temperature. I can see no actual benefit to the foil-like material on the inside that is supposed to trap heat.\nThe takeaway- a good shell- but Interchange does not necessarily mean what it says. Buy with caution if you are mixing and matching.",

The shoulder/chest fits fine (I'm 6'2\" 155 lb) and the length is actually better than North Face. The sleeves are a tad short but the overall torso fit is much slimmer and neater than North Face's ultra relaxed fit.\n\nI can wear just this Mighty Lite in 40F, and my torso and arms would be warm while everything else not covered would be very cold. It also works extremely well as a liner for a soft shell jacket.\n\nThe stitching isn't exactly the best. It is already starting to unravel near the main zipper\n\nOverall: 4/5 stars, would benefit from better quality stitching",

It's so light weight and thin that the mail courier was able to roll up the parcel and jam it into my small NYC mailbox. Upon first sight and feel, this jacket appears to be a spring or autumn jacket...not worthy to wear in winter weather. Well, I put it to the extreme test yesterday. It was an absurdly cold night (7 degrees, felt like -10 here in NYC with 30mph wind gusts). I wore this light jacket with a sweater and you know what? I WAS WARM! It retains your body heat just enough to keep you warm without overheating you or leaving you with frostbite. Kudos to Columbia for making such a great jacket! My only disappointment is that I wish I knew they came in tall sizes. I'm 6'5\" and thin, and bought the large size. While it fits, I think I'd have been best suited for a tall medium. I'm still completely satisfied!!",

This jacket does not disappoint. Also, if you are not spending a lot of time outside, or if you are staying active outside, this jacket will surely keep you warm enough even down into the mid 20s. At least that has been my experience so far. If your looking for a lighter jacket that keeps you warm in conditions anywhere from 25-50 degrees I would recommend this product.

                "review_body": "This is the nicest rain coat I have ever owned.  I'm used to the heavy ones that do not breathe at all.  I was surprised at how well made this Red Ledge rain jacket is.  The rain jacket is a good material thickness for the cooler rainy days, but I also don't think it is too hot when it gets muggy out during the rain.  This jacket has pit zippers which open up a huge area to let you get some fresh air in and the hot air out.\n\nI find these a must now that I've worn a rain jacket with venting areas.  This just makes you so much more comfortable.  I was also able to keep these completely open during the rain and I never got wet.\n\nI also really like the hood on this rain jacket.  Most rain jackets have a hood but it is always in your face and if you turn your head it gets in the way.  The hood has a shock cord running through it that can be tightened, above your ears where a baseball cap is worn, and it keeps the hood in place.  This is great and I found it to be very comfortable.\n\nI am 5'10\" and 154 lbs. I read a review that said the rain jacket runs a little small so I ordered a large which is a size up from my normal jackets.  I found this to be just about perfect.  The back is longer than the front of this jacket, which I like for using on a bicycle and the sleeves were just about an inch or two long which is great for reaching for the handlebars on the bike.  I would recommend one size up from your normal size as it also allows you to put another layer on underneath if you need to in colder weather.",

NOTE: I ordered the orange, this is a really bright international orange much brighter than the product picture on Amazon.  Also, this jacket fits slim. I usually wear XL shirts and jackets and originally ordered this jacket as a XL.  While I could try on the garment there was no room to add any thermal layering thicker than a tee shirt. I reordered as a XXL and this fits much better with plenty of room to add a base layer and a fleece. The larger size also gives you much better freedom of movement.",

I stay nice and dry, it doesn't make you sweat like you're wearing a trash bag or something (looks a hell of a lot nicer than wearing a trash bag too just sayin) the hood is adjustable too so it's not hanging down in your face and field of vision, there's zips in the pits to veltilate it, the pockets too are made of mesh so if you don't carry anything (I'd be careful about that, don't carry anything in your pockets with sharp corners in it you don't need to anyway, that's why you have a backpack but your phone is good in there, easy to get to, safe in side  and dry)  but anyway, those pocket sif you don't carry stuff in them open the jippers and you've got even better ventilation. the length of it it comes down to my crotch, I'm 5' 10\" weigh 180 and I got the large witch  fits good, not tight not baggy. Wish I would've gotten matching rain pants not only for the color but because these are good quality rain jackets, but I got a separate rain pants, also Red Ledge but sort of bronze/brown color anyway, I stay pretty dry,  I've never hiked yet in pouring rain that lasts all day with this jacket yet, but I'm pretty sure anybody's rain jacket and rain pants, if you're in the rain hiking all day longyou're goig to to be wet, from either rain or soaked from sweat because it's so hard hiking up and down mountains with a pack on, you're going to sweat like a hog in any rain jacket in the summer.",

It gives very good def from wind and the material looks like polyurethane - absolutely waterproof. The size of the pockets with long zippers is very comfortable. The straps on sleeves are good, but sometimes hard to handle with wearing gloves. It is not breathable and since I didn't use vent zips it always was wet inside, when I undressed after skiing. It was not a problem for me, because I dressed jacket over fleece layer, but there are special vent zippers on sides and you can open pocket zippers to vent too. So if you don't afraid of cold you will be dry :) I prefer warm. The back is longer and this is good for them, who wear pants, with bibs it doesn't matter much.\nTwo things I miss. 1 - small pocket on chest or sleeve for ski pass and 2 - possibility to close and open zipper two ways - from top and from bottom.\nMy son wear NF Resolve Jacket and his is looking expensive and costs a little bit much than mine, but I still prefer my Green \"Red Ledge\", because it more comfortable.\nI am 6'4\" height and 100kg, XL fits me perfect.",

I couldn't believe it. This morning when I left the house I thought I'd add another layer-a fleece vest. So in 28 degree weather I wore a long-sleeve generic tee, a fleece vest, and this jacket up top. I was perfectly warm! This thing traps heat like nobody's business. I can't tell you how surprising this has been. I love biking in cold weather wearing a minimum of gear. It's fantastic. Highly recommended.

My old north face was also insulated with synthetic materials and was plenty warm enough.\n\nIt\u2019s made well and it\u2019s comfortable and it looks good.  Pockets are comfortable for your hands.  It\u2019s roomy enough to wear over fleece pullover.  Materials are nice.  Just wish it was warmer.\n\nNote that they put the zipper flap only on the inside only.

                "review_body": "First off, I want to note that I bought mine at a Columbia Outlet and it's identical to this one except mine shows \"Columbia Titanium\" on the logo and this one lacks the \"Titanium\" designation - they are otherwise identical in construction, materials, features, etc per the description and picture, so I assume it's the same jacket & Columbia at some point decided to make it a part of their Titanium line.\n\nThat said, I have mixed feelings about this piece.  First off the positives: the biggest draw is that it looks really nice.  The wooly outer finish makes it look a bit classier than a standard softshell or fleece.  The stretchy sleeve accents and cuffs, however, give it a sportier technical looking edge.  It really rides the fence between sweater and jacket, with the look of a pseudo-cardigan but the sturdier fabric & weight of a jacket.  In any case, it's sharp and handsome.  Second, the fit is accurate with the XL fitting me just like I would expect.  It's not an athletic fit, but not overly baggy either.  A clean design with sleeves that are amply long for this long-armed guy.\n\nNow the negatives:  first, the Omni Heat feature doesn't seem that noticeable.  I wore this outside playing with the kids on a damp overcast day in the low 40s with a long sleeve tee underneath, and was still a bit chilly.  In particular the jacket isn't especially wind-resistant, with occasional light breezes cutting through it a little.  I hoped that with the \"Omni Heat\" technology it would be toasty in what I consider moderately cool temps, but I was still a bit chilly.  Second, you HAVE to wear this zipped up unless you want to take a major beat down from your friends for the disco shiny silver lining.  Seriously, I think Columbia will go farther with this Omni Heat thing if they can tone down the glitz.  Lastly, this jacket lacks much in the way of technical features.  No extra pockets beyond the two hand pockets, surprising since Columbia is usually great about giving an extra pocket on the chest or sleeve.  There's also no drawstring to tighten the waist, so cold air can find its way in around the midsection.\n\nAll in all, I think this jacket works really well for casual use like a sweater.  Is is less effective, however, as a cold weather jacket.\nWithin that context, it's a good casual wear value at a lower price point (I snagged it for $32!) that you'd expect for a nice sweater.  But if I were spending closer to a hundred bucks or more on a jacket to keep me warm, this one wouldn't make the cut.",

Yes, if you leave your jacket unzipped, wind will get in there and it won't function that great as a windbreaker...who would've thought...

I also wished the jacket was actually olive green as it's pictured, but the field khaki is a dark muted khaki color instead. The material was very heavy duty and the lining was nice. The shape of the jacket was also boxier than it is in the photo, and isn't as refined / nice looking as pictured. I would recommend this as a very casual rugged working jacket.",

                "review_body": "Well made jacket and nice design for work clothing.  Not as nice as some of the pictures, though.  Material is fairly tough and happily not as stiff as I expected.  I would give it 5 stars except for the sizing.  I'm 6'1\" tall with a 41\" chest, 32\" waist, and weigh 164lbs.  I usually take between a 34\" and 35\" sleeve in a shirt.  I bought this jacket in size medium.\nThe width of the jacket fit nicely, though there would be no room for layering.  However the sleeves were too short so I am returning it.  I wish the sleeves had been longer.  I recently bought two Carhartt jackets in medium, an the sleeves were plenty long enough for me.  I think Dri-duck needs to update its sizing, because men are taller than they were in the 70s and 80s, when medium was meant for a 33\" sleeve, whereas these days many clothing manufacturers design medium to fit a 34\" sleeve.  Too bad, I really would have liked to keep this jacket.",

                "review_body": "I have been spending a great deal of time looking for a jacket to replace my decade old canvas cotton bomber-style jacket from Camel Collections.\n\nThis jacket, in the core elements, looks similar to my beloved bomber. It has a contrasting color collar, although in the case of this jacket, the collar is made of corduroy (not leather). It's a camel (khaki) color for the main body. It lacks the leather accents on the side pockets.\n\nWell, since I had spent upwards of 15 hours in shopping malls and online searches, I decided to go with this jacket, and accept that I would never find another canvas cotton bomber that combined subtle accents of style with the comfort and toughness of canvas cotton.\n\nSo, I decided to roll the dice and hope that this jacket would be a suitable replacement for my old bomber.\n\nHere are the Pros and Cons.\n\nPros\n\n- The Canvas Cotton material feels tough, durable and breathable\n- Just the right number of pockets (2 side, 1 breast, and 1 interior)\n- Tough, well constructed zipper\n- Large sleeves with ample room and a tight cuff which won't let wind through\n- The nylon lining is warm and suitable for winter wear\n\nCons\n\n- The jacket is a bit on the heavy side (as another commenter mentioned)\n* The description of the jacket indicates it has a \"bi-swing\" back, which turns out to be extra \"flaps\" of material on the shoulder blades section of the jacket, which, in my opinion, look ridiculous\n- The \"drop tail\" back looks a bit like the coat tails of a concert pianist, or the tail of a duck\n- The description provided on the page uses terms like \"bi-swing back\" and \"drop tail design\" which the average consumer would be unfamiliar with and be unable to conjure up an image of. A picture of the back of the jacket should be provided (so I did. check out the customer photos for shots of the jackets back)\n\nAfter having actually touched and seen the jacket up close, tried it out, and looked at in the mirror, I have come to the conclusion that this jacket is really NOT intended for casual wear. Rather, this jacket is designed, specifically, for guys who are working in construction and heavy industry.\n\nThe \"bi-swing\" back, with its flaps of extra material, does indeed provide additional freedom of movement for the arms and seems specifically designed with the vigorous movement required of guys working on the job site in mind.\n\nAs indicated in the title of the review, this jacket is very similar in construction, material and style to a Carhartt. It's a bit more stylish than the typical Carhartt, perhaps not unsuitable for being sufficiently flattering in appearance to ask out a pretty girl from the local building supply store, but it is definitely not suitable for taking said girl out for dinner and a movie.\n\nDid I like this jacket? No. But I was expecting a jacket I could wear as a casual jacket for going out and about. I think this jacket is very suitable for construction, both contractors and journeymen.\n\nI would be happy if I knew that this review helped guys to have it crystal clear to themselves that this jacket is NOT suitable for casual wear, and to purchase it if they are in the market for a warm jacket to use working on the job site, or shopping for building materials.\n\nAs for me, my quest for a stylish, canvas cotton bomber, continues.\n\nP.S : On a quick side note, I purchased a very cool bomber from Mark's Work Wearhouse which looked like it had been taken from the closet of a WW II bomber pilot. Unfortunately, the material was PVC, and as I learned, PVC does NOT breathe at all. If you are looking for a jacket, don't buy PVC, unless you want to remove your jacket at a party and find that your shirt has unsightly sweat stains marring its appearance.",

It's really a coyote brown color like a different reviewer mentioned.  Still looks good. The second jacket was tobacco in color.  I like the dark brown in tobacco better.\n\nMy deal was close to 50.00 dollars a piece if I recall off hand.  That is great price for the quality being on par with Carhartt.\n\nJackets are very sturdy.  Personally I don't think the material is too heavy for it's obvious intended use.  It's a work jacket that can pass for casual wear. These jackets will last for years.  Wish I lived a colder climate to get more use of the two jackets I bought. I''ll simply keep one for real work and the other for casual wear.\n\nOn that note, the styling is good.  I'm not the most fashionable person but this is a guys jacket.  Make no mistake, your not getting metro-sexual styling.  That's a plus.\n\nThe fit was excellent.  I'm broad shouldered and the jacket fits in an XL size.  Typically when I buy a suit, I buy 48 regular.  Based on the Dri-duck sizing chart, that seemed right on.\n\nI definitely would recommend this jacket as a good buy.",

The waist is curved, longer in the back that in the front.  This allows you to bend over to work and pick things up while not exposing your lower back.  The ONLY reason this coat didn't get a 5-star rating is because when zipped all the way up, the neck opening is too loose around your neck.

I'd call it a lighter shade of tobbaco (its got brown and a bit of Army green hint to it). It's very good looking. Now, this is a working-man's jacket, so, yeah... it's heavier than a nylon yuppi's jacket. The bifold shoulders do the job properly and retract perfectly, the heavy 12oz canvas's weave is tight enough to minimize the wind cutting through it, the corduroy collar is comfy and doesn't sit tight on the neck (though if you zip all the way it wraps tight). The back of the coat has a bit of a drop-tail so when you bend over you don't expose above the belt but it's not excessive. There are two nicely done inside pockets (one's zipped for a cell or small note pad, the larger one is terrific for placing a flashlight or tools... whatever). It's also got an exterior zippered breast pocket. There's an elastic cuff in the sleeve, the inside has waffle-sewn insulation with a black nylon covering so it slides on and sits well over your work clothes. Lastly... this baby is using YKK zippers and they glide like a Caddy!\n\nThe only thing I hesitate on is whether it'll be warm enough with the 1/2 inch of insulation. It gets to -20F here so there's no cotton jacket in the world that handles that! So, I'm prepared to use layers. The good news is the jacket's wind resistant and provides enough roominess to wear at least good shirt and Polarguard sweater underneath.\n\nI run a tow truck and need something that fits comfortable, is tough and washes without having to pamper it. I don't mind looking good while I'm at it. I can honestly say I was 100% happy with this jacket in every regard. And especially happy I didn't go with a Carhart for 3 times the price.",

                "review_body": "Update: After spending the day getting snowed on for approximately 4 hours, the jacket was starting to soak with water. The claim that these jackets are waterproof is a bit misleading and once I dug a little further into the Striker Ice website I came across their explanation. Bottom line these jackets are not waterproof by definition. They are to a point. The waterproof rating is 1/5th that of Gortex. They also claim the zippers to be waterproof yet the pockets did have some water in them. A jacket at this price range to me should have better protection, but maybe I am just asking too much.\n\nLove this jacket. I haven't had a chance to really test it and I pretty much use the liner or the shell. The liner is good for the mid 40s for general use. I have worn the shell by itself as low as 27 degrees and though I could feel it a little bit in the sleeves, my core area stayed comfortable with just a t-shirt. My biggest gripe is for a 4xl the sleeves are short when my arms are extended. Maybe that's by design. I dont use this jacket for it's intended use (ice fishing) so maybe there's a reason. I have a long torso and this is one of the few jackets that fits me good. Only other thing I'd like to see is this jacket made in the US and not china. I'd expect to pay 320.00 for a US made jacket but not a Chinese jacket.",

Beyond that, I love the jacket. I was in Chicago recently for work, walking around at night is was under 40 degrees and very windy. This jacket performed very well and kept me warm and I did not feel the wind on my core. I love Columbia products and have a variety of their clothing. This performs well and is probably still a great deal at $60, but was a steal at under $40. Next week I will be taking it to Denver and the expected lows are as low as 18 degrees and I am confident I will be fine with this as my top layer.\n\nThe omni-heat radiant barrier is a nice touch but my 8 year old daughter refers to this my \"disco-ball jacket\" and it is pretty accurate -LOL. The lining is a micro dot pattern of shiny-reflective thermal dots. Again, given my experience in Chicago last week I could careless about the nickname.\n\nThe sleeves can bunch a bit if you are wearing layers, it just takes a second to adjust them, and is not a deal-breaker in my opinion.  The jacket runs large, but I like that feature as I am going to be wearing layers often anyway if I need this and I want my top layer to run a bit larger to go over everything. If you are going to run around in this and just a t-shirt, then you will notice the size a bit more.\n\nThe only thing I wish was different was the hood. I will never wear it and wish it was just a standard collar like their fleece or other jackets, however again at $40, I really have zero complaints.",

The fit was great (XXL) kept me warm down to about 20 degrees. It's thin, light weight comes down to about the middle of my butt and seals great here as well as velcro sleves which are a little long.  The inside is reflective and looks like the extremely material they make ladies evening gowns out of - kind of  looks like a mirror (reflective material) I'm sure it helps reflect body heat to keep you warm.  The material doesn't seem to chafe bare skin\n\nHere's the problem after a few months of wearing - it looks awful, it even has a wore out appearance. The outer wool is now COVERED with those little balls of fibers like an old sweater gets.  I see why they offered it at such a great price less than forty bucks.  Now it becomes my yard raking-mowing jacket instead of the great looking Columbia jacket I'd hoped for. Good thing I didn't have to pay full price.",

                "review_body": "UPDATE:  10 years later ... As I mentioned in my original review, the sleeve liner catches on your clothes, and eventually the seam gave out.  Interestingly, the zipper also failed.  I stopped wearing it a couple of years ago when these things failed, but then as I was going through my closet, I came across this jacket and remembered the warranty.  I thought, \"what the hell\" and I sent it in.  Much to my astonishment, the jacket came back to me a couple of days ago and somebody had literally restitched the seams that came apart and they had sewn a new zipper into the jacket.  I had to come on here and increase my rating for this jacket, because I am so impressed that the company hires people to fix clothing that has failed - not just send out a new item.  I am still completely flabbergasted that they believe in their clothing so much that they think it is worth hiring somebody to fix it.  Boy do I wish more companies were like this!  I am still not crazy about the design flaws, but it's hard to fault them when they are willing to fix the jacket.  Fair enough - it's been 10 years, but I'll keep wearing this jacket as long as they keep fixing it.  Game on!  GO COLUMBIA!\n\nI like Columbia because of their return policy and the quality of their product.  What I'm not crazy about are the sleeve liners, which move independently of the sleeve and catch on clothes.  It makes putting the jacket on a challenge because you have to try to get all the layers (the shell, the liner, and the long sleeve shirt you are wearing) to behave themselves so that you don't end up with the various layers bunched up and uncomfortable.  It's not a deal breaker, but it seems like a design flaw to me.  Also, the zipper doesn't lay well--it's like there is too much zipper for the material that is attached to it, so it creates unattractive waves in the material.  I know this sounds negative, but I do like the jacket!",

                "review_body": "Fit: In dress shirts, I wear a size 15 32/33 shirt. In suits/sport coats I wear a size 38 short. I ordered this in a size small.  Shoulder fit is good, chest fit is a little snug (good for a 2nd layer IMO), stomach area is a bit lose on me, sleeve length is PERFECT (not too long like on so many layering pieces). Collar fit on me is good and would be for a 15.5 neck size too.\n\nWhy I ordered: Years ago, I bought a MH Monkey Man 2nd layer \"jacket\", my first piece with the grid lining - and I fell in love with that piece and it's effectiveness/performance so much, that I bought the same for my son and daughter. I have since found the grid fleece interiors for a 1st or 2nd layer to perform far better than a typical fleece interior - better wicking away while also holding heat (without feeling wet).  What I like better about this piece vs. the Monkey Man: smoother exterior fabric makes for easier layering (putting on and taking off) and also the fact that there is not a hood that is uncomfortable after putting on subsequent layers (I never need a hood on a layering piece - that's what my outer layer or a hat is for - IMO).\n\nI am a layerer, typically wearing 4 layers (base, 2, 3, outer shell). This piece is on the moderate or thinner side as a 2nd layer (this is neither good or bad, just that it is what it is). It will hold/trap heat, but also wick and breath due to the grid pattern (my experience). On super frigid days (ie. <5 degree F), I would opt for one of my heavier 2nd layer pieces (or wear an insulated vs. shell outer layer).\n\nOverall - the fit is very good for my body and preference. I like the look and comfort of the \"jacket\" and am glad that I purchased it as another option for a 2nd layer piece.\n\nI've owned a fair amount of Mountain Hardware products over the past 15+ years. Sleeping bags & pads, pants, tops, jackets. Overall, I've been exceptionally happy with the quality of their products. But I have heard that more recently, their quality has diminished (becoming more like The North Face - away from performance and more towards fashion). I can see a little bit of this in this piece, the seems on the sleeves are a bit larger than they could be - but of course, going smaller and lighter would add to the cost (if this is of utmost importance to you - look at the Arc'teryx 2nd layer pieces).\n\nMountain Hardware has excellent after sale customer service. I am in the process of sending in a 10+ year old soft shell winter jacket where the zipper has started to come open in the middle. I contacted them asking what the price would be and was informed the cost would be $30, but that it will likely be covered under warranty. Outside of this zipper issue (which to be honest, I don't think they should fix for free for a 10 year old jacket), the rest of the jacket is in like new condition - exceptionally pleased with it's performance and the other products I've owned from Mountain Hardware.\n\nSorry this is such a long review for what is really a pretty moderately priced mid layer piece, but for others who want more than just the normal - loved it, hated it, didn't fit, etc. I've tried to provide useful info.",

Overall I am all about functionality and therefore am happy with the product.  But as I said before the product picture and jacket art shown on the purchase page do not match what you get.",

This jacket keeps me tingly warm with just a thermal waffle shirt underneath. It's sturdy material, built to last. The only thing missing is some large inside pockets. The hand pockets are a bit too small, and I lost a glove the first day because of the pocket's small size. Other than that I'm extremely happy with it.",

Also one side of the collar sags and the other is more sturdy. They aren't even. I guess I'm also not using the jacket how it was designed to be. It looks good when everything is zipped and strapped up.\n\nsummary: disappointed with the design. its something to keep in mind if you ever want to wear it unzipped. maybe I'm just the wrong customer for this product.",

I purchased this with the intention of not wearing a heavy coat in Manhattan, NY, which I never did. I wore long underwear, blue jeans, wool socks, t shirt, thin wool sweater, and this jacket, along with scarf and gloves. I did not freeze in 25 to 35 degree weather, but neither was I warm. When the wind blew, I really felt it on my arms. At this point, I shivered and was not warm. Hence, it cannot replace a heavy coat. But without the wind, I managed to stay warm. The style is great! I look professional in very a sporty jacket. The fit is perfect. I am 5'10\", 185 lbs with a 33\" waist. The reflective technology (inner lining) is suspect.\n\nFor the look, fit, and versatility, this is must have jacket.\n\nI use this for:\n\nRain, light wind, cool weather, not cold weather",

This jacket runs small.  And not just proportionately small, but in an oddball way.  It almost seems like this was patterned for women and just upsized.  I ordered an XL, and the sleeves and hem were the right length, but the shoulders, upper arms, and areas around the armpits are all very very tight.  This is while trying it on with just a t-shirt - not good for a jacket that is marketed for cold weather and as having a new patent pending ultra warm lining - I usually wear something more substantial tha a t-shirt (base layer & fleece or long sleeve shirt) in winter.  That being said, it is attractive, the innovative lining seems like it will work, so I will try and re-order in 2XL, and see if it fits (hopefully the sleeves won't be too long, with the hem below my crotch).  I'll update the review accordingly.",

The reflective liner may work but it needs an insulation layer to trap heat and to keep the cool surface of the material off your body.

I had to use an insulated jacket over it to manage. In fact, there wasn't much difference between wearing the two jackets together and just wearing the insulated jacket by itself! Also, the velcro straps on the cuffs of the sleeves cut into your wrists and catch on other clothes, sometimes damaging them. Very over-rated and over-priced! Just a gimmick!",

It's space-blanket liner does just as advertised, keeps you pretty darn warm even when it's 30 degrees outside and the wind is blowing in your face. The pockets are soft and nice, and I like the breast pocket for keeping my valuables. The charcoal grey was a nice color, and less tan than the picture on Amazon shows. It gets a 4 star rating simply because it was a little stiff. It had nothing to do with the fit, but the material. It didn't want to move very much, and the hand holes were far too big. Maybe I just didn't use it enough, but it did almost feel like I imagine a straightjacket would.\n\nI know that sounds grim but it really is an awesome jacket and if you live somewhere really cold, it's definitely worth trying.",

He had not actually seen this item in person, but liked the features as described. He needed a warm but light-weight jacket. I trusted the Columbia name, but rather than buying it directly from Columbia (the link he provided me), I found it on Amazon (same color, correct size)for much less in cost. He was absolutely thrilled and had an opportunity to try it out right away as he ventured out into the snow on a frigid night to go sledding. He returned singing the praises of this jacket which comfortably kept him warm and dry. He is very slender and the fit is perfect on him. A great, quality jacket; especially when purchased through Amazon for a significantly better price!",

I should emphasize that I am not a body builder.  My hands would not go more than half way down the sleeve and would not come close to fitting through the end.  There is no elastic cuff so there is no give.  I normally wear a medium (small in some items) and the tag claimed this was a medium.\n\nI notice that other reviews are from women.  Maybe this thing is cut for a slender woman who's trying to be stylish even though it says \"men's.\"  I bought it to keep me warm in the outdoors and I really don't care about what some magazine says is stylish.  I would often wear it over some other garment.  This isn't possible when a bare arm won't can't be forced through the sleeve!\n\nIt is lined with a strange reflective material that looks like aluminum foil.  The effect is startling but I can't say if it works since I couldn't put the jacket on.  The jacket also has some panels that are just fabric and lack any insulation other than the foil stuff.  It seems that this would not be very warm.  Since I couldn't put the thing on and it's 98 degrees outside right now I can't test that.",

I have a different Columbia fleece that is a small and it fits the same as this XL. Also, I ordered the \"plum\" color, and it did NOT come as pictured... there were NO thumb holes, but the sleeves were longer (which I guess is ok).",

Most plush jackets are shapeless, you sacrifice style for comfort, but this jacket has both.\nThe stitching and the seams are flawless. It has great shoulders and looks amazing from behind.\nIt runs a little small. I'm 5 foot eight and a size 6, and I wear the large so that I can layer other clothing under it.\nFor cold women who want to gorgeous jacket - - you can't go wrong with this one!",

I purchased it in a large because I read all the reviews and everyone said they run small. I checked this jacket out on so many websites and some listed the model's height & weight and all said the model was wearing a large. I put this jacket on and I look like a turtle. I am a 5'3\" Asian girl 125lbs. A lot of people said they usually wear a size small too and purchasing a large was a good fit. I like that it has the hem drawstrings to tighten at the waist, but it didn't tighten all that much. Maybe because I purchased it so big. Overall I love this jacket. I ordered a medium to see how the fit is. Very happy with it :)",

                "review_body": "Update 8/25/2014\nDropped 2 stars.  The jacket is no longer shedding rain that well.  Columbia has offered to replace it as they have lifetime warranties on their products so this is why I'm giving 3 stars, or I'd be giving it 2 stars.  I just haven't sent it in.  The other solution is to reapply waterproofing to it, but I shouldn't have had to do that within a single season of purchasing it.  I'm probably going to have them replace it, but I need to cover shipping so I haven't decided yet.\n\nOriginal Review 4/5/2014:\nI was looking for a jacket that was light but able to shed Seattle Spring rain and winds, looks casual and stylish without looking too sporty or like a shell. I wanted a go-to jacket for everyday wear to take to restaurants, walk the town or to wear to church.  I wanted a jacket that wasn't too warm, but not too light that it offered no protection to the elements.  It took me a while to finally settle on this jacket simply because I was looking for one with a hood.  I finally saw this on sale for an amazing price and couldn't pass it up and I'm glad I didn't.  It is perfect for what I was looking for.\n\nI don't wear the collar up like in the photo, I wear it down and my daughter says it looks great that way.\nThe Omni-Heat only covers the inside back and arms so you don't see the shiny silver if you wear the jacket unzipped which is great.\nThere's enough room to wear a long sleeved shirt without the arms feeling too tight, I'm able to move around in the jacket without feeling restricted.\n\nI purchased the Buffalo colored version and when I received the jacket I thought they sent me the wrong color.  Under my house lights, I could have swore it was a dark forest green so I thought I was sent the \"Moss\" colored jacket.  I thought it looked fine, but I was wanting the brown as pictured.  I then showed my wife and she said she wasn't sure what color it was, kinda looked gray, or dark green, or maybe even brown... then I took the jacket outside in the daylight and it was definitely dark brown.  Totally weird, but kinda cool.  Still not sure it was the Buffalo, I went to the Columbia website and lo and behold the color there for Buffalo was darker than what is portrayed on Amazon, but it does kinda look like that color in the sunlight. So just beware.\n\nThe zippered outside hand pockets are very spacious and I love how they zip up, so you can keep things secure without fear of stuff falling out, though I doubt they would even unzipped as the pockets are deep.\nThe button breast pockets are also great and useful, but much smaller than the hand pockets.  Good for ticket stubs, parking passes, etc.\nThe only thing I miss is an inside pocket, it doesn't have one.  So the breast pockets get more use than they otherwise would.",

It's has the right amount of length, the accents add a nice pop of color, and the tall collar does a remarkable job at keeping my neck warm and protected from the elements. It works well in inclement weather or to pull on over a dress shirt in an office or coffee shop that's air conditioned like the arctic. This has been such a welcome addition to my wardrobe that I just ordered a second in a different color. NOTE: I'm 6' tall, a trim 188 lbs and typically order a MED in garments such as this however I found the LARGE Helly Hansen fits wonderfully.",

When it gets below zero or there are strong winds on a cold day you can definitely feel it. Wearing long sleeves and an extra layer helps on those days. I certainly wouldn't recommend getting into a shirtless snowball fight or making snow angels in a bikini like in the Omni-Heat commercials because it won't warm you up that fast unless it's almost Spring. Also the Boulder is slightly darker than in the picture but not by very much. I'm glad I bought this jacket.",

I would particularly like to point out the i5 processor and the solid-state hard drive. Add that to the 8GB RAM and it makes this a lightning-fast machine for any work. It has a high-resolution screen and a pretty decent battery life. The laptop comes with Windows 10 Pro pre-installed. It is very light in weight and you don\u2019t even feel the weight in the backpack.\n\nIt also has a touchscreen and fingerprint scanner. Although for me they are not of much use and seem like a marketing gimmick. But some people may like to have these features.\n\nThe only regret I have is that the 8GB DDR4 Ram is soldered to the board and hence there is no possibility of upgrading the Ram even if you want to.\n\nOther than this, it is a great laptop and comes at a low price. I would surely recommend it.",

The laptop is big enough with a 14\" touch LCD to see all your web pages clearly, but its so compact and light you will never know your packing a laptop in your bag.  This thing is light.  It is so light and thin it makes easy to stow away in small compartment of my luggage.  The only bad thing is I am afraid it may break while in my bag.  The performance of the laptop is so worth it.  Fast Solid State Drive and 8GB of Ram makes this an easy speed demon.  The Intel Core i5 is powerful and can handle everything I asked it to do. I would say this laptop would be a competitor to the Lenovo Yoga, or Dell XPS.  I am very impressed with the battery life with this laptop as well.  Love this little machine.",

                "review_body": "There's a lot to like in this little package.  Here are some quick thoughts and observations from the last month.\n\nPros:\n\n1) Easy set-up.  One thing you'll immediately note is how easy the Acer TravelMate is to set up.  My teenage daughter intercepted this before I got home and was happily checking her school email within 30 minutes with no assistance from me.\n2) Responsive components.  The full-size keyboard is nicely responsive and feels very natural when typing.  The mouse pad is the same and a huge step up from our Chromebook.  The backlit keyboard not only looks cool, it is very handy when typing in low/no light.\n3) The processor is decidedly adequate for non-gaming-specific uses.  While not lightning fast, it's by no means sluggish when navigating web applications (including games), word processors, etc...  We can have multiple applications and windows open without noticeable lag.\n4) The hard drive IS lightning fast, saving and loading remarkably quickly.\n5) The webcam is sharp and has been very useful lately with all the Zoom meetings.  (I verified this by hosting a meeting on another computer.  Again, the audio and video are a giant step up from our Chromebook.)\n6) It's very light.\n\nCons:\n\n1) The screen is a bit on the dull side.  The colors are not particularly vibrant.  If you're hoping to use this for movies/gaming, it's adequate but you'll might be underwhelmed.\n2) Norton comes pre-installed.  If you've had that on any PC, you know how much of a pop-up headache (and how darn-near impossible to uninstall) it is.  (Ugh!)\n3) Glitchy Google Chrome.  Can't explain why but we cannot use this computer's Chrome browser.  It is constantly asking for parental permission for use, which we've repeatedly granted through my Google account.  It was so frustrating we did a factory reset and reinstalled Chrome with a different account attached.  Same result.  Now we have to use Explorer.  (Shiver!)\n4) The touch screen isn't great.  Feels like an unnecessary expense, too, since we navigate almost exclusively without it.\n5) It's very light. Listed as both a pro and a con.  The pro side should be obvious.  On the con side, it has me thinking this unit needs to be cared for with kid gloves.  It doesn't reek of sturdiness.  I'm not saying its wimpy (I'll post an update if something remarkable happens one way or another) but it kind of feels that way.\n\nOverall, I'm very pleased with this unit.  Everything feels decidedly \"adequate\".  There are better \"value\" options out there for those who don't want to spend this much, but if you're looking for a satisfying and functional laptop for work or school, this is a solid choice.",

                "review_body": "My laptop does light video and audio editing, lots of desktop publishing, and web browsing, often at the same time, which has been a problem with some laptops I've had.  This one handles it well with no lags or hiccups (two MS Office apps, 8 browser tabs, Premiere Elements all at once).  The screen is sharp with warm colors that pop.  The 3 USB ports (2 3.1 and 1 USB-C) handle a backup drive and USB hub with no issue.  I really love that this has a full size HDMI port on it so I don't have to waste the USB-C port on a video cable.  The keyboard is also identical (1/2\" less wide) to a full-sized external keyboard, so typing is easy and feels good.  However, because it is smaller laptop, there is no extra number pad and the Insert/Delete/Home/End/PageUp/PageDown keys do double duty with some others.  However, the Fn key does turn some of the keys into a number pad (Fn+F12 [NumLk]) so you can get a true number pad on this.  The keyboard is also backlit with a white light so typing in dark places is no problem.  Acer did maximize space and you can see that this is significantly smaller than a 15.6\" laptop (first pic) in size and is just under 3/4\" in height at its thickest.  It is made of a material that feels like a hard plastic but is super lightweight (just over 2 lbs.).  The WiFi has great reception and is speedy.\n\nTwo notes.  The back is attached with about 11 hex screws (0.8).  I tried to see if its was upgradeable but the back also seems to be glued on as well and didn't pop off after the screws were undone.  I always run an external drive anyway so not a problem, but this may be a consideration for some.  There is no memory card slot either, which seems to be more and more common now with cloud storage, but my hub solves that issue for me as well.  I'm still getting used to this but so far have no complaints.",

                "review_body": "Acer's TravelMate X514-51 has been an awesome piece of equipment \u2013 especially during this time of working from home. Powerful, fast, and extremely light \u2013 weighing in at 2.16 pounds. It\u2019s almost like carrying a manila folder. This is mainly due to its magnesium alloy composition, giving it the look and feel of a plastic hard shell case. It\u2019s so light that you might even forget you have it in your carry-on \u2013 so be careful!\n\nLike most laptops, it opens to 180 degrees and had touchscreen capability. The lid comes with a slightly raised Acer logo. You get a 14-inch 1080p display (Full HD) with good touchscreen responsiveness. You also get a screen cleaning cloth to keep things clean. The webcam is located at the top of the screen. You\u2019ll have to provide your own privacy cover. Speakers are on the bottom on the unit. I don\u2019t use it for gameplay, so there\u2019s no real benefit to great speakers for business purposes. If anything, the headphone jack provides the necessary means for sound should it be needed.\n\nThe keyboard is full-size and sits above the trackpad. The trackpad is one piece (no separate buttons for left/right clicks), but it does offer the left/right click capability in the pad. You just have to make sure your fingers are hitting on the right spot. To the right of the trackpad is a fingerprint sensor for security. During setup, you\u2019ll be walked through the steps to establish this option by recording your fingerprint, similar to that used on the iPhone.\n\nInside is the Intel Core i7-8565U. This does just fine for me speed-wise. You can get into clock speeds and comparing GHz differences, but I had no delays with several apps open, along with PowerPoint, Excel, Word, and the Firefox browser open. The most common RAM in laptops is 8GB. Here you get 16GB RAM, which makes for great performance when multi-tasking. The TravelMate also comes with 512GB SSD.  I\u2019ve learned to use an external hard drive, but this is a decent amount of storage nowadays and I use it as my back up. The battery life clocked in around 6 hours and took about 45-60m to recharge.\n\nAs far as ports go,  you get two USB type A ports, an HDMI port, a standard 3.5 mm headphone jack, a USB type C port (I use this for an external hard drive), and a Kensington lock. I\u2019ve never used a Kensington lock, but if you\u2019re using your computer in a public place and want to prevent someone from swiping it if you step away, it\u2019s something to consider.\n\nOverall \u2013 4 \u00bd stars overall. Great performance, a super light but secure design, and a system that doesn\u2019t run hot. Very impressive!",

                "review_body": "Overall, this is a solid laptop for the price. Acer has never been my favorite brand but they do seem to offer some of the best value laptops if you cant afford something more high end. The laptop is unbelievably light. I\u2019m used the my Lenovo Thinkpad (work station) and I feel like I still use way too much effort to pick it up, sort of flnging it up and back down again unintentionally. One concern I have is that it sounded like there is something loose in the laptop since the day I got it and I\u2019ve yet to open up the body and find out what it is. When I picked it up, I could hear something moving around in it and I think it finally got stuck somewhere because I\u2019m not hearing it anymore. I don\u2019t love the keyboard, it definitely takes some getting use to how flat it is and the spacing feels a little uncomfortable. If you\u2019re not switching between numerous laptops and keyboards, you\u2019ll probably get used to it and rarely notice it again. For me, it feels a little unnatural and the depth of the keys feels strange. I\u2019m sure some of this is a product of being such a thin laptop. The great thing about though is that I can fit it in any of my backpacks, even my smaller ones without issue. It\u2019s more compact and lightweight than my Mead notebook. It\u2019s also faster than my other computers (my more powerful work stations) but that may just be a product of being brand new. The display is nice, a little more vivid and crisp than my slightly older laptops. It was also packaged pretty well. The packing wasn\u2019t anything too crazy, not foam or buffer padding in the box which initially scared me but it was very secure in the laptop product box. It\u2019s hard to say exactly how well it will hold up over time but so far it seems to be a pretty good value for what you get factoring in the size. I\u2019d recommend looking at one in person first before deciding (or check the return policy) It\u2019s a good laptop but I feel a little awkward typing on it so I only ever use it when I\u2019m on the go/ working outside of the house or office. I'll update again in the future as I continue to use it.\n\nThe fingerprint sis bait doesn\u2019t work. Maybe that\u2019s what the rattling sound was when I received it. Either way, it\u2019s annoying that new product has features that are either physically damaged in the body of the laptop or just straight up don\u2019t work.",

                "review_body": "I wish I were a little more computer savvy, so that I could give you all the statistics and specifics about this Acer TravelMate x5 Thin & Light Business Laptop, that most people want to hear. Just know that I've been using a computer, almost daily, for more than twenty-five years. I know what I like, and what works for me. I needed a computer that could be used for our new family business. Mostly used at home, but could be packed up and used on site. This Acer TravelMate seems to be exactly what I needed. It's very light, weighing in at just a little over two pounds. At fourteen inches, it could easily fit into most of the purses that I carry. ( Okay, who am I kidding? Any chance to buy a new bag - I'm all IN!) With up to ten hours of battery life, it's very portable. I can go all day without having to worry about plugging it in, and tangling with cords. The initial start up, was so easy! Cortana, your virtual assistant, created by Microsoft for Windows 10, walked me through the process, every step of the way. This Acer TravelMate has Windows 10 Professional, which was created for advanced users and small businesses, who may appreciate the advanced features, such as encryption, Remote Desktop, assigned access and more. Further bolstering your security, this computer has the Acer Bio-Protection Fingerprint Solution. All very useful features for many, who have concerns about the security of their computers, and it's contents.\n I mentioned that it's small, at only fourteen inches. I have to tell you, I've owned a couple of tablet computers, and I found that with them, that smaller space ALWAYS meant a sacrifice of typing area, and function keys. I don't find that to be true with the Acer TravelMate. I'm more inclined to use the computer's calculator for math, and I don't miss the additional numerical keypad, at all. I LOVE the backlighting! It automatically dims down, when you're not actively using it, and with my fading eyesight, it helps me to FIND all the function keys. The HD screen is gorgeous, so crisp and clear. Frankly, it was the first thing that I noticed about this computer. It's stunning! The more I use this Acer TravelMate, the more I love it. I haven't had a whole lot of time for recreational moments, on this computer yet, but the few shows I've put on, and videos that I've watched, play well, and look and sound great.  I feel like I'm not sacrificing anything, and loving all the \"new to me,\" features. Because it's billed as a laptop, I'd be remiss if I failed to point out a feature, that some might find problematic. If you use it AS a laptop, ON your lap, with sound, the speakers are on the bottom of the computer. This seriously muffles the sound. It sounds best on a solid, hard surface. This Acer TravelMate meets all my expectations, and I've become reliant on features that I didn't know I needed. Every day I'm discovering new features that delight me, and I'm finding, invaluable.",

Fingerprint scanner is hit or miss, mostly miss.\n\nI got the laptop around $750.00 so it was a steal for me but at $1000 you might want to check out the HP Envy x360 13 AY0021NR with the Ryzen 7.  Faster processor, faster video card, .  Ryzen 8 Core, with great video card. Gorilla Glass.\n\nOverall I think the X5 it is a really good laptop, at $700-850.  Once you go higher I would recommend the faster Envy X360.",

My docs & photos that are on my phone are also on the HP 360 Chrome which is very cool. I did have to power off then back on because my sound cut out . I it was an app notification that started the issue but honestly can\u2019t say. After I restarted the 360 it\u2019s been fine ever since. I basically will be using it to surf the web, produce & save documents, send emails every now and then and stream movies. Having the USB type C ports are like icing on the cake. Already ordered a 10\u2019 type c to HDMI cord to stream movies to the tv in my RV. The touchscreen is great!! I unplugged it from the power for the day to see how long it will last. It\u2019s been over 12 hours and the battery is no where near depleted. I haven\u2019t been on it the whole time but a good amount of the day. Hope this review helps someone.",

                "review_body": "The Vivobook 15 is often compared and contrasted with the Acer Aspire 5. In my opinion the Vivobook is a far better choice!\n\nThe Aspire looks nice and performs decently, and the screen is great for the price. But inside, it feels really cheap, with the battery not actually even being fastened in place at all. And the RAM expansion slot in the one I got didn't work and Acer tech support was entirely unhelpful. I returned it.\n\nBy happy contrast, the Vivobook feels quite sturdy, almost like aluminum even where it's plastic, and the inside seems... not premium, but well built. And RAM installation (and SSD replacement) went smoothly. Great BIOS, too, the best I've seen.\n\nMine *did* come with a 2.5 inch hard drive expansion caddy and connector in the box, which is a nice touch.\nI'm running Linux (openSUSE Tumbleweed) on it and it runs flawlessly. Just boot to BIOS and turn off Secure Boot and Fast Startup, then reboot to a USB flash drive with the installer for the distro of your choice.\n\nI do think the Aspire has a somewhat better screen. But the Vivobook screen is still fine for the price; not the most colorful, but brightness is adequate and text and images are sharp and clear.\n\nVery happy with my purchase!",

Few days after I found the issues with Caps Lock button sticky and stuck in hole I had to lift it up sometime by using my nail (the sound when I press it's totally different with others) the day after I can't use my finger print to access it.\n\nI just use it in general work. I have had contact someone to help vis My Asus they said that I just bought it I should return to local reseller??? I live in New Zealand or I can send it to service center at my cost??? If I return to Amazon and get a new one, how I can know that issues won't happen again? It's not my fault at all 100% no damage from me.",

When I received it, it was in store display mode and I had to do a ton of online searching to figure out how to get it out of that mode. Then after only using it for maybe a month or 2 the tablet has stopped being able to remain on while off of the charger. So, after while of only working on the charger, the tablet just stopped staying on for more than a minute even with being on the charger. The battery is clearly the problem since it was the display product which remains on the charger the entire day at the store, which damages the battery. The worst part about it was that there was no notice this was the store display product and no instructions or help to resolve any issues I might run into. If you're planning on buying this, make sure you check it isn't the store display product. Can't emphasize it enough. Other than this HUGE problem, the tablet is awesome and I would've given it a 5.",

The display is probably one of the best tablet displays I've ever seen, even now three years later thanks to the amoled tech. The storage space is low but with the expandable drive it's not too much of a concern. It would be nice if Samsung enabled adoptable storage so that you could use it system wide but they have yet to do so. It runs plenty fast, playing any 1080p video I have thrown at it. All in all I highly recommend this, even at three years old.",

I mostly use tablets for media consumption and web browsing. I read tons of reviews between various tablets and this one seemed to be the clear leader in the android space for a larger screen tablet which I really wanted over the ipad 2.\n\nThe user experience for this tablet is very sub par imo. I went back and forth on whether I should keep it and try and load a custom ROM but in the end I decided it would not be worth it, the tablet should work out of the box from a performance perspective.\n\nBrowsing is incredibly slow in side by side comparisons with my very old nexus tablet. I used several different browsers and all of them seemed like I was on a dial up connection with content rich websites. Dolphin browser seemed to be the best but I enjoy using Chrome and I shouldn't have to change my browser because of a hardware/software in a tablet. The screen looks good but at the same time the display driver doesn't seem to perform very well, scrolling and movement are often very jittery and don't appear to give a great experience. Some games performed well while others seemed almost blurry with movements.\n\nI'm not a huge apple fan but I may have to go with an ipad 2, the nvidia shield looks to be my only other viable alternative. I'm really disappointed that this tablet didn't work out.\n\nI would not recommend this product unless you've never used another tablet before and maybe don't know what you are missing.",

                "review_body": "I have an Android phone but this is my first experience with a Android tablet/computer. I'm used to Microsoft and i use MS Word and Excel a lot. I  wanted a downsized laptop so I thought this wpuld be a great solution: wrong, wrong wrong. I tried to make it work but after three months I'm finally giving up. There isn't much wrong with the tablet itself, but the Android operating system is a royal pain if you try to do anything serious with it.\n\nFirst of all, most of the \"apps\" (similar to the Android phone apps) that you download are dumb downed and are missing a lot of important features. First example is banking. Basic stuff with Wells Fargo worked OK but when I wanted to download an old statement it would not work no matter how long I talked to the bankers. Second example is using it with my Fidelity brokerage account. I could not use it to make a money transfer - not happening with all of their technical support. Their suggestion; use a REAL computer. Their built-in Hanscon \"Word\" and \"Excel\" applications work OK by themselves but because of the MS copyrights saving and recalling files is a pain because they make you jump through more file manipulation steps to get to you folders. Another major pain is basic editing features. It is almost impossible in some applications to do simple \"Copy\" and \"Paste\" types of functionality. I know that apart of the issue is that application developers are to blame - it doesn't matter who's at fault if you  can't do what you want.\n\nThe positives are that it has a great display and some of the \"phone like\" user interface features are nice. The battery life is OK and the touch display works great. The price is great too. It just isn't ready for use as a serious laptop capable computer - it falls way short. I'm taking a loss on this purchase and now I'm going to try a Lenovo Yoga 2 in 1 running Windows 10.",

I had an iPad 2 from work and wanted a tablet of my own for home.  I have the Samsung Galaxy 5 phone and felt so-so about it. It's battery does not last and it has more features than I need.  But the background knowledge helped me set up this tablet very easily!\n\nThe screen is gorgeous, email, Web surfing, games, easy, sound is WAY better than iPad and the battery lasts forever.  I love that it has a micro SD slot so I can transfer stuff to my laptop or desktop.  Pdf files are way easier on here than on the iPad too.\n\nSuper happy I bought this tablet. I just need to find a good case now.\n\nAlso, download Amazon play store to get your Kindle app and stream music from the Prime Music app if you have a membership. I played music for 4 hours today and it only went down to 80% battery power. That was impressive to me!",

                "review_body": "I upgraded from an old Acer Iconia Tab A500. I'm really not seeing a big difference in performance except for the screen resolution. I find the Galaxy Tab S is a little more responsive but nothing significant. The Galaxy Tab S has one BIG DOWNSIDE. Samsung has loaded it so full of bloatware that it actually made me angry with the countless updates and pestering me to sign up for this or that. Google is in your face constantly with their apps too. At one point a popup advised me that it was updating 239 apps (I have installed only 37 of my own).  At times I really want to put a bullet hole in it and ship it back to Samsung...  but watching videos is much better then on my old Acer.\n\nBEFORE YOU BUY BE AWARE THAT SAMSUNG HAS PREINSTALLED TONS OF JUNK APPLICATIONS THAT WILL ANNOY THE SH*T OUT OF YOU. You can't uninstall most of them. You'll have to go through each and every one of them, determine if they are required for the operating system by google-ing etc.  Then you have to disable them if possible - not all can be disabled. After that you have to hide each one from the menus to get rid of all the clutter.\n\nToo bad.... this is a really nice tablet otherwise. As it is Samsung has decided to sell you a product full of advertisements and tricks to get you to sign up for this or that.\n\nMaybe I will shoot it...  I'll keep you posted.\n\n2/21/17 I shot it with a 4/10 shotgun and yes, I enjoyed doing it. The tablet began to fail a few months ago. The battery would sometimes charge and other times not. For example, I would leave it plugged but when I went to use it the battery was low. I was also experiencing frequent lockups when the battery got low. Yes I checked cables etc. (internal and external). I fully regret this purchase and would not recommend this brand tablet to anyone. Google the issue regarding battery problems and you'll find a lot of unhappy owners. This item is too expensive to take the risk.",

I own Samsung TVs and their pictures are beautiful too, so I can say that they have done it again in this Tablet.  I know that I will get very little sleep tonight because I'll be exploring this wonderful Tablet.  Looks like Apple has some real competition with this one.  I do love my iPad but I can already tell I'm going to love this Tablet too and I'm not certain I want to spend any longer what Apple wants with its hardware, of course time will tell.\n\nIf you are looking for a new Tablet search no further and go for this one.  I was looking for the larger screen size because of being a game player but I have been reading that Samsung should be coming out with a new smaller screen size sometime this year, so if smaller is what you want just keep waiting.\n\nLove it, love it.",

Nice weight, stunning graphic, fast processor, stable and solid in every respect. There really isn't much to add to the other reviews because it just IS the best Android tablet available. That said, I wish they had stayed with the soft-touch buttons that stay on the bottom left of the screen however you choose to orient the tablet. The three hard buttons fixed to the bottom of the device REALLY get in the way when you hold it vertically when reading a book or playing a game that only plays when the device is vertical. I'm sure there was a reason for doing this, but I LOVE the moving soft-touch buttons of my Tab 2 and do NOT like these stationary hard-touch buttons at all. Since everything else about this tablet is wonderful, I'm only taking off 1 star for the dislike of the buttons, but I would love this tablet completely if not for this one, stand out poor decision by the people who designed the Tab S.",

Having used the previous variations of the Galaxy Tab back to the first 7 inch version, this is by far the best Android tablet out there. The tablet is light, though not quite on par with the Sony Xperia Z2 Tablet, and it is thin. The screen is gorgeous and the battery life is much improved.\n\nI am not completely sold on a fingerprint sensor for a tablet, though. Maybe for business use, but for personal use, not quite.\n\nPros\n\nLightweight & thin\nGorgeous display\nFast, even with TouchWiz\nGreat battery life, roughly 9-11 hours with 8-9 hours of screen time using low brightness\nSmaller bezels - finally\nDual speakers!!!\n\nCons\n\nTouchWiz still isn't the best UI. I installed Nova Launcher for a better experience.\nBloatware - But this isn't a Nexus device so it was to be expected\nSmaller bezels - where can I put my hands without interrupting the scrolling experience?\nPhysical buttons - come on, Samsung, it's 2014. On screen buttons should be the standard.\nSpeaker location - could be on the front. Hey, at least we got two!\n\nConclusion: Overall, the tablet is a vast improvement over previous Samsung offerings and near the top of the list for Must-Have Android tablets.",

                "review_body": "My daughter got one of these for Christmas, and I was blown away by the screen quality and snappy response. I purchased the white 16 GB model, and have been VERY pleased. Video playback is a beautiful thing, as are the games I've tried on it. I've thrown some very video intense games at it, and it hasn't lagged or stuttered once. I happen to like the S5 look, and am pleased that the tablet works so well with my phone.The tablet came with Samsung coupons for 50% off any accessory, so I purchased the bluetooth keyboard case. I'm not overly crazy about the case design - the tablet and case remain separate pieces; when closed, the tablet fits into a slot and is held in place by a spring-loaded clip. When open, the tablet rests at an angle into another slot. It is, however, an EXCELLENT keyboard and is an incredibly useful extension, making the tablet come very close to a mini-laptop.\n\nThere are some issues with some of these tablets. My daughter's tablet is unable to stream video from Netflix OR the Google Play store. She can download video that she'd rented or purchased to her SD card and play it, but steaming will not work. We found many folks who'd purchased this tablet had the same problem, as there were hundreds of comments regarding the Netflix issue. We called Netflix, and they responded that it's a hardware problem with Samsung. Same response with Google. To date, no response from Samsung. Best advice if you purchase this tablet and run into issue where you can't stream - contact Amazon immediately for an exchange or refund. I sincerely hope you don't encounter it though, because in every other respect this is an awesome device.",

I carelessly (& accidentally) dropped the first one, face down with it being in its Samsung cover, and the darn thing had a large crack across the entire screen; though it still functioned properly. For awhile, I had been using it in its cracked state, but after awhile, I couldn't take it anymore. So, I ended up purchasing this same tablet all over again. I am a previous iPad 3 owner and will never go back to Apple again. The Galaxy Tab S 10.5 is still by-far, the best tablet on the market, in my opinion. It's even better than the Tab S2. I absolutely LOVE the high resolution screen on here, being able to watch Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, control my Roku, use Microsoft Excel, Word, PowerPoint, and love that I have the option to insert a micro SD card if I want more space. The only (& first) drawback I had after only a week, was experiencing the tablet not turning on or charging. Since this had never happened before, I decided to Google the issue. Turns out, while it is a rare occurrence, you need to do the following 3 in order: Press and hold down the Power -- Volume Up--Home keys at same time for 20 seconds, after which the green Android mascot should appear. When it does, it will give you two options to choose from. Choose the option that let's you cancel out of it (Press the Volume down). Next, the screen will say it's  downloading & not to turn device off. Wait about a few seconds, then repeat the holding of Power--Volume Up--Home keys at same time for about 10-15 seconds and everything should be back to normal. Make sure you charge it immediately. Aside from that extremely  minor and rare mishap, this tablet is a must!!!",

So I've been messing around with it all afternoon. So far I like it. The display is insane and the keys are huge. Those were my biggest concerns and they are solved. It is noticeably faster. Even Web pages seem quicker. I'm still confused about a couple of things? Mostly settings. It says you can adjust the screen to a couple different settings but I try it just stays at the setting it wants to stay at? And a touch setting that says it's for wearing leather gloves to tap the screen etc. I was hoping for a setting that would make the tapping harder! You just look at this thing and it types or whatever. Less sensitive would be good.\nI'm not sure I would rate it better than the iPad just yet? It is quite a bit easier to navigate. Could be I just don't understand apple's icons very good? The screen alone is much nicer than ipad. And I can see where having two browsers open side by side will be usefull. Or maybe a map and a browser., IPad can't touch that! Much lighter than Eileen's ipad. But her's isn't the iPad air? So I'll just have to take their word on that. I thought I read that this had a mini USB port? Haven't investigated that yet but unless the charging port doubles as mini USB I can't find it?\nSo, all in all I would advise that someone looking at ipad take a side by side look at the Tab S. I have a feeling that if I took this into an Apple store they would ask me to leave! Hmmmmm. Sounds like fun?\nOh, I've been using the fingerprint scanner to unlock this. Seems to work fine.\n\nSo, that is my official first day reveiw. Feel free to sell it to your friends, co-workers and family! Lol",

I wanted a tablet with a great display and high end processing power.  After researching numerous Android tablets (Apple's high price and lack of expandable memory eliminates iPad's from my consideration), I settled on the Galaxy Tab S.  I am extremely happy with my purchase for a number of reasons.\n\n1.  Display - You can't appreciate how vivid and vibrant this display is without seeing it in person.  In a word, it is gorgeous to the point where you want to use the tablet more and more.  From movies on Netflix to magazines on Google Newsstand, the display just continues to impress me.  I've played with an iPad Air, Air 2, and mini and none have a display as good as the Galaxy Tab S.\n\n2.  Size - This is an extremely thin and light tablet.  Compared to the Air 2, I can't really tell a difference in size or weight.  The Galaxy Tab S does have a slightly bigger display, but not by much.  The aspect ratios differ as well; I believe the iPad has a 4:3 and the Galaxy Tab S is 16:10.\n\n3.  Micro SD - This is a great feature that sets the Galaxy Tab S from an iPad.  I was easily able to play my music and some videos on a micro SD card.  The tablet detected it without any issues and I didn't have to spend time side loading them onto the tablet like you would have to do on iTunes.  Knowing that I can simply swap out a micro SD card with additional media will make this a great tablet to have when traveling.\n\nOverall this is an excellent tablet.  I got my for $447 on Amazon, which is even less expensive than a $499 iPad Air 2 16gb model.  If you are looking for a top end tablet, the Galaxy Tab S is the way to go.",

                "review_body": "Bought mine as a FACTORY refurb 2 1/2 years ago and it has performed flawlessly since day one! I emphasize factory, because as far as I'm concerned you're taking your chances buying one refurbished by anyone else. I use it every day, for everything from running my small business to just about every type of gaming. I can count on one hand the number of times it has locked up or power cycled, and it's always been due to bad apps I've installed and not the tablet itself. Battery life is still great...with steady use it'll last all day and if i unplug it in the morning and don't happen to use it until evening, it'll usually still be over 90% charged. Anyone with experience knows that its the screens on our devices that use up the most power while we use them, and this big beasty is no exception, so keep it set to auto adjust the brightness and it saves a lot of juice!\n  The one and only flaw it has is due to the boneheaded decision Samsung made when they decided to build their flagship tablet with only 16gb of storage! That combined with the ridiculous amount of bloatware Samsung cant stop themselves from burdening their every device with, means that you will have to keep a close eye on storage space.\n  Samsung was nice enough to toss out an update to Android 6.0.1 some time back, which improved things a bit by allowing the disabling of unwanted factory apps, which in turn did free up some space. However, the ONE feature that all of us in the Tab S 10.5 fanclub were REALLY looking forward to with Marshmallow, that of being able to format external memory cards as INTERNAL memory, Samsung chose NOT to implement! I know, right! There IS, however, a workaround that can be found on the XDA Developers website, for those savvy enough to try it.\n  So, my recommendation is, by this tablet! It's not perfect, but none are. It's got one of the best screens available, even by todays standards, plenty of power, excellent build quality, and if you can keep the app installs under control (or try the workaround I mentioned), you will have in your hands one of the best!",

                "review_body": "This tablet is expensive but worth it if you want the best screen you can get. The colors are vivid and the picture is very sharp. The device connects to my new samsung 46\" tv and when viewing video on both simultaneously you can really see the difference. I was doing this while viewing parts of the last Craig Ferguson show and wow- his set looked much more colorful and sharp compared  to the TV's screen. More contrast on the S too.  Also on Christmas eve I shot some aerial go pro video of my cousin's farm. Christmas morning I showed them the video on the Tab S and several commented on how great the picture was. And, I did not tell them it was a new tablet before hand. So if you are buying a tablet for videos and pictures,then the screen is well worth it.  The device also has better connectivity than other tablets too. It has software that connects to your desktop/laptop so you can exchange any kind of files between your pc/tablet/cloud service. The tab S sees other devices in my house for connectivity and this was important to me as I don't like tablets/phones that try to limit your access to the outside world.\n\n  If you can, try to look at the product in a store before you buy so you can see for yourself.  I did not do this and bought the Tab S 8.4 at first but after seeing the 10.5 in the store I had Amazon exchange it. The 10.5 size screen is much better for me but look at both and decide for yourself.\n\n Also I recommend you get some kind of case right away to protect the Tab S. Here is an inexpensive one that works well and while you may want something fancier later, this will get you going:\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00L7GVIBQ/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1\n\nNow if you want to travel with you Tab S, here is a really nice Amazon traveling bag that fits the S well. This bag is of better quality than I expected for the price and I highly recommend it:\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DUGZFA6/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1\n\nTo balance this review,  I will have to say that Samsung also makes really nice mid line tablets as well. My GF got the Tab 4 8.0 and this is a great tablet at a much cheaper price. If money is an issue, look at these tablets. The screen is not as good, but it is still VERY good (better than the professional reviews will have you believe) and worth a look if you can't spend the money on the S.\n\nI just read on the news this morning that Sony is coming out with a slightly larger tablet than the S, but without the nice screen. The price is going to be around $1000. Ouch! Good luck Sony competing at that price , esp with a basic LCD screen. Now I don't feel so bad about the S's price after reading that :)",

This tablet is fast and I've only had mild lag issues.\n- Android. The interface is wonderful, smooth, and intuitive.\n\nBut it has one fatal flaw. Bloatware.\n\nI am paying for a 16gb tablet, yet I can only use a fraction of this amount because of the many unnecessary apps that are pre-installed and impossible to remove. Why?\n\nIf apps come pre-installed, allow us to remove them. I don't use Evernote, yet it is pre-installed and impossible to remove. Why? What function does this serve?\n\nDoing the math, buyers really get about a 8gb tablet. 4-5gb goes to system memory and another 2-3gb are apps you can't get rid of.\n\nI could add a SD card, but that also has drawbacks. In my experience, SD cards are unreliable. I've lost data numerous times due to SD card failure. This is the path I took and if I find a reliable card, I will update my review here.\n\nIt is really a shame that such wonderful hardware (and some software) gets dragged down by bloatware.",

                "review_body": "This tablet just blows me away!  I love the super-bright display and all the ways I am going to be able to use it!  It connects to my desktop so I don't need to store all my files on the tablet!  I can see my \"scrapbooked\" recipe cards while I cook, or read the sewing instructions I've downloaded while I sit at my sewing machine.  I have music on a tiny micro SD card, photos of my family, and I can read lots of Kindle e-books that I've downloaded to it.  It's  my computer, only portable!  I can wander all over our neighborhood with it and still surf or send email via Wi-Fi.  (Tip:  I did buy a new and very powerful combo modem/router to give me extended range - a Motorola Surfboard Extreme).  The full screen-width keyboard is easy to use for any size hands.  It is extremely fast when loading anything.  The battery lasts all day, and the camera is as good as my Canon SD, so it takes great pictures! The beautiful white case looks like expensive art glass.  It will soon be my ONLY computer because I'm having reconstructive surgery on my dominant hand, but I'll be able to do everything online that I need to with this delicious device, using only my non-dominant hand.  It will keep me happy during an otherwise very frustrating several months of recovery, and then again when I have my other hand surgery.  You can even choose to set it up for right or left handed use!  It does so much more than I expected, so I am just delighted with my purchase.  Be sure to get a nice case/stand to put yours in, because these are a bit slippery.  I will not only have a leather case/stand, but I'm making a beautiful tapestry mini brief case with handles to carry it in, because for me, handles will be absolutely necessary, but not everyone will need them.  If you have other things to carry, I recommend a case with handles, though.",

No device is worth this aggravation\n2 too complicated of an interface with for example 4 different categories of settings  and some of the placement and terms make no sense.  It took so long to figure out and i still dont get it  ex.Whatz \"dreamware\" setting mean?\n3If there is an sd card port i cant find it-- or exactly which data device to buy from amazon,\n4 Theres so many settings for power savings  that i have absolutely no idea why it is using up power so fast...even tho i attempted  the max power saving settings.\n5 Samsung communication and support is abysmal on weekends.  The agent on Live Chat from overseas had no device to see and no information about it at all.  Wasted an hour with her and then she tried to transfer me to Smart Tutor but it was way to late at 7 pm Saturday Pacific time!\n6 You cannot download itunes via wifi,\n7 It is very large and awkward and shuts off easily  coz of  where the buttons are placed---so  one cannot use it w/o buying a cover/holder\n8 It takes a special fast charging cord but it gets lost & mixed up in a big household and hard to remember which one it is.  Why not make it red or purple to stand out?.\n9  the device flipped for a while  from desktop to desktop.  I dont know why  they have three home screens except they were needed to fit on all the bloatware icons!  Nothing is explained in writing --just strange logo icons,  I use this so rarely i cant remember what each one means .or all the steps to go thru.w/o consulting google search constantly..\nWhen Samsung customer service didnt have a clue how to fix my home screen issue or how to put on a file icon for audio i eventually had to do a total factory reset  that took hours due to my music files.  I can hardly wait till  i will be able to get a pc expert to root this device so i will be able to install and uninstall what i want ! This is so unintuitive and  so confusing that i wish sincerely i had not bought it. Its not for non techies like me(smile)\n\nPRO:s\n1 Great picture!\n2Amazing high def camera that is easy to use and makes beautiful photos and nice wallpaper for the homescreen and a great Gallery!\n3 There are a number of colorful covers available on amazon that make its huge size easer to handle\n4  It has lasted a year with no breakdowns or issues that i needed to go to pc repair shop.for\n5Good replacement for a dvd player if you dont have a small laptop and have wifi available\n6 Thaere are so  many factory apps that some have to be useful-- . such as sVoice. when you figure out the commands to say\n7 It seems to have a huge amount of internal data storage space for Kindle audiobooks app and never had to juggle songs or delete apps to install new ones,\n_______\nConclusions This device is \"neither fish nor fowl\"  You get the approximate size of a small laptop without the flexibility and clear interface .  You do get a great camera but w/o the many advantages of  a much cheaper cell phone  --plus it is crammed with permanent bloatware --so why not just put out the money upfront for a high quality l laptop with windows 7 or 10 and save the annoyance?",

                "review_body": "I have been using an original iPad for about 4 years, and switched to an iPad air last year.  Each of those were $500 at the time I purchased them and held up great (iPad 1 still works well).  However, my two kids have basically taken ownership of those and I didn't want to spend another $500 on something with only 16gb of space.\n\nEnter the Samsung Galazy Tab S 10.5.  Yes, it only has 16 gb of space, however it has a micro SD card slot, so I bought a 64 gb micro SD card and drastically increased the memory.  I can now actually have all my music and hours upon hours of videos without having to constantly manage them the way I did with the 16gb iPads.  I know apple sells iPads with larger space, but I don't want to drop $700 on a tablet.  I was able to find this tablet for $400 during the holiday season.\n\nPros:\n1 - Beautiful screen - Videos look amazing and crisp.\n2 - Can freely transfer movies/music via micro SD card.  I am no longer trapped to iTunes or CopyTransManager (great iTunes alternate).\n3 - Multi-tasking ability - I find it pretty easy to jump around in the KitKat software.\n4 - Torrent capabilities - I've heard that some people use torrents to download media, it can be done directly on this device and you don't have to work your way from PC>copytrans/itunes>tablet.  It can all be done on one device here.\n\nCons:\n1 - My biggest concern so far is the lack or high volume.  The volume is fine for watching at home/car, but I fly alot and I'm worried it won't be loud enough to drown out the plane nose.  There are volume booster apps that help (22% increase IIRC). My favorite iTunes feature was that you could go to the movie properties and increase the volume 100%, that was a huge help on flights.\n\nI really can't oversell the advantage Samusung has with the micro SD card option over the iPad, it makes everything so convenient, at least for my purposes of movies, music, and photos.",

                "review_body": "Every new Samsung tablet (and there have been already 13 different tablets released by Samsung just this year alone) is inevitably compared with the Apple iPad. The Tab S is so far a crowning achievement for Samsung and it is pinning it's fortune on the new Amoled display, which is simply put, gorgeous to look at. Amoled technology (unlike more conventional LCD which powers iPad and every other tablet on the market) does not rely on background lighting to assist display. Instead, each pixel (and there are more then 4 million on this tablet alone) can be individually lighted on demand. This translates to black colors that are true black and whites that are true whites. Resulting contrast is more then 1,000 times better then any leading LCD display on the market. This display is also more battery friendly and thinner then LCD which results in the record setting thinness of the entire tablet (only 6.6mm or .26\"). Samsung Tab S display can go very bright in full sunlight to very dark in dark rooms at night. It is also easier on the eyes in the dark situation due to larger resolution and better contrast. You can read it in your bed at night without as much eye strain as other tablets. This display is revolutionary in the tablet market and Samsung should get all the credit for introducing it without additional price tag. So what about the rest of the tablet hardware?\n\n- CPU: Samsung uses 2 quad core CPUs that are slightly beating Apple in-house CPU in benchmarks.\n\n- RAM: 3GB of memory, compared to 1GB in Apple results in much better multitasking. iPad can perform marvelously when you are running just one App, but if you have many apps open and switch between them often, it simply can not keep up.\n\n- Wi-Fi: Dual-band AC Wi-Fi chip that Samsung is using supports the latest generation of routers and results in faster internet speeds and further distance it can go from the router, compared to iPad. I have a large property around my house and have no problems connecting to internet from 100 yards away with still respectable speeds. Of course your results would vary depending on the number of walls between router and the tablet and your router specs.\n\n- Battery: Samsung Tab S lasts me around 10 hours of general use (only light gaming, mostly browsing or streaming videos). Apple iPad in comparable scenario lasts around 12 hours. Kudos to Apple in-house CPU which is extremely power conscious and overall iOS more conservatively tuned compared to Android. Both tablets have very long life though.\n\n- Weight: Samsung Tab S 10.5\" is much larger tablet vs latest iPAD Air yet it is lighter (even if by a hair). I use it without any cover and can comfortably grip with one hand for a long time.\n\n- Sound: Tab S has two side facing speakers (in landscape mode which is natural for watching videos) with stereo sound. There are complains that they feel under-powered and lack bass. These complaints are justified. While speakers can go pretty loud when source provides aggressive soundtrack, a lot of movies go for a subtler approach and this tablet can not compensate. So games, music and TV shows are usually loud enough with good stereo separation, but many movies feel a bit quiet even at maximum sound. I caught myself many times trying to adjust sound when watching movies specifically.\n\n- Other secondary specs are all in favor of Samsung. GPS, SD card slot that supports up to 127GB of extra on-board storage, fingerprint sensor for user login and support for multiple users (so you can safely share your tablet with your family), multi-window to run up to two different apps at the same time (for example watching movie and running browser on the side to read about actors/plot). Apple iPad has none of these features.\n\nSo why, you would ask I still rate latest Tab S at 4 stars instead of 5? It is all due to software and App ecosystem that truly differentiates Samsung tablets from Apple iPads. iOS is simpler to use compared to Android with Samsung TouchWiz interface on top of it. If you prefer to use your tablet as is and don't like learning and exploring all the features that it can provide, Apple gives you what you want. Android has been leapfrogging iOS in features and functionality for the past couple of years, yet Apple is not fighting this battle. It gives you one option where Android would usually provide 4 or 5, but this single option is better implemented then most of the Android alternatives. Samsung own interface (TouchWiz) and App marketplace tries to bridge that gap and fails miserably. Samsung just can't write good software. They throw more and more bells and whistles at you hoping that at least something would stick. Alas, even techies would turn most of these off after a day or two of playing. For the rest of the consumer mass it only adds confusion and additional learning curve. I would list just few of these features here: face tracking, side syncing, low power mode, hand gestures, etc. They all are only marginally helpful and mostly gimmicks.\n\nFinally there is App ecosystem. If I can argue that Google marketplace has long caught app in Apps for smartphones, this is still not true for tablets where Apple marketplace still provides more and better refined options then Android. Most of the popular apps and games are present on both platforms. But developers prioritize iOS to Android due to better return on investment and wider, more affluent tablet audience with iPads compared to myriad of Android tablets. This results in many apps coming to iOS first and then ported to Android. And existing apps usually have better interface on iPad.\n\nSo here you have it. Great tablet, best display on the market bar none, cutting edge hardware and very good software that is better suited to non-conservative consumers that are willing to play with all that the tablet can provide vs only wanting to use it as is.\nI would also add that you need to take a closer look at 8.4\" version of the same Samsung tablet. It is lighter, better fitting to one hand using and provides same hi-res Amoled display and identical hardware. If you spend more time reading compared to video watching, it is a better alternative. It is also $100 cheaper, which puts it in more budget-friendly territory.",

                "review_body": "I bought this tab through Amazon a few weeks ago, so far I am loving it. The look and feel as well as functions exceeded my expectations.\n\n1. Design and appearance: as many review sites already mentioned, it has much better screen (AMOLED HD) than iPad Air, the resolution is about 20% higher. I was very impressed with how good video and pictures look on it. The screen is slightly larger than iPad, but the tab weights less (-0.4 oz off an already light weight). Overall design is slick and well-build - might be too shinny & slick though, it's hard to hold onto it.\n\n2. Interface: initial set up is easy. the tab runs on a full Android system (v4.4), operation is smooth. I have been juggling different programs at the same time, there is no lagging. I tested the tab with Google Play Music, Spotify, Milk Music, HBO Go, You Tube, Netflix, etc. You can also use the \"Watch On\" app to control your TV and Set Top box (I tested with Att Uverse with great success). It has got 3GB RAM vs. iPad's 1GB, and 8MP rear camera vs. iPad's 5MP.\n\n3. Connectivity: I happen to have a Samsung Smart Blu-ray player, which allows me to \"screen mirror\" the tab to TV through the BD player. The experience is tons better when you surfing the web, Facebook, YouTube, or other social sites than using the incumbent apps on your smart TV or BD player. The screen mirror does leave black bars on both sides of your TV screen, due to the mis-match of resolution between the tab and your TV. If you are not completely satisfied with this, you can try \"pair\" your tab with either your Samsung TV or BD player - this works only with some apps (I tested YouTube with success). Alternatively, you can try Google Chromecast to cast everything through HDMI port. The tab also connects well with my Android phone through \"sidesync\".\n\n4. Expansion: one reason I choose this tab over iPad is that it comes with MicroSD slot. I bought a high speed SanDisk msd with 64G capacity for this tab, which is working well. For years Apple has been ignoring customer request for MicroSD ... they force the customer to choose different hard drive capacity, so they can charge more $$. I like very much Samsung leave the choice and flexibility to its customers.\n\n5. Price: the tab is about :$80 to $120 cheaper than iPad Air (considering the memory expansion). I don't see how iPad can compete since the tab offer all functions and more than iPad.\n\n6. Battery: not bad, but I hope it lasts longer and charge faster, one area for improvement.\n\nOverall very satisfied.\n\n---------------------------------\nMarch 2016 Update\n\nEverything still works well, however, I did find a major issue: with recent update of Android system, the feature of moving apps from internal memory to MicroSD card has been disabled for most apps. This means you will be running out of the 16G memory pretty fast, and makes the MicroSD expansion completely useless. However, based on my research, it is more a restriction implemented by app designers and Google Android, so it is a bit unfair to blame Samsung. Nevertheless, be aware of this issue if you plan to buy this tab.",

                "review_body": "I did a research for 2 months about tablets since I don't like to buy things by impulse... Since is a medium/large investment I wanted to be sure that this is what I need it... Currently I have a Samsung Galaxy S4 as a phone and a Macbook as a laptop.. Previously I had an Iphone 4s and an Ipad Retina Display which undoubtedly you can guess I was an apple user... But when I bought the Galaxy S4 I did it because I needed a flexible device with more space and I can't afford paying extra $100 for 16gb more on i-devices when you have android devices with memory card Slots which you can purchase 64gb for $30... Same happened with the tablet... I wanted a device that can replace what I normally do on the computer:\n- facebook\n- youtube\n- email\n- browsing\n- downloading torrent\n- watching movies (all formats mkv, avi, mp4, etc)\n- watching or editing word docs\n- listen to music\n- playing casual games...\n\nOn the Galaxy Tab S I'm doing all that with plenty space or power to do more things... let me give you my review of the main point of this tablet:\n\nDisplay: nothing more to add that hasn't been said... simply the best display on a tablet.... its look much better than my Ipad retina display (which I gift it to my GF), color on ipad look pale and wash out... people complaint that color on super amoled look over saturated... and even if they do... I don't get how people complaint about it when it just look better than any other devices..\n\nDesign: This is something that I don't care that much... since I'm not looking all the time at the back of the device... I'm looking at the screen... but feel like a premium device... is super thin... and lightweight.. Yep.. the Ipad look more premium with the metal cases.. but the Galaxy tab S doesn't feel cheap like other samsung tablets like the galaxy tab 3...\n\nPower: The octa core processor work great.. I'm giving this device a very heavy use so far and I haven't felt any major hiccup or lag... yes sometimes It doesn't response right away like when you exit out of an app and want to open other app right away... but is just normal like any other premium android device... unfortunately this is how the OS works... don't get me wrong... is really fast and these so called hiccups or lag are barely noticeable and even if you noticed, its for about 2 secs then the tablet response is normally... It happened sometimes on my retina display Ipad as well... I guess this is normal for any device with... well.. ram... even computers have the same problem for over years...\n\nInterface / OS: This has been the main problem with androids.. the ecosystem is not a fancy and good looking as the IOS and samsung touchwiz is not well optimized and look dull... I have to say that by far this is the best touchwiz experience that I had.. I still prefer how IOS look and feel over android, but this is a major improvement comparing it with my Jelly Bean Galaxy S4... kitkat touchwiz is on the right direction... but they are not quite there yet... the black and blue tones are something borring and the menu, settings, contacts, profile, etc.. haven't change since... well.. ever.... just minor touches but still look the same... I'm hoping for a major overhaul with android L... I hope that they change the interface on touchwiz... that since galaxy S1 is very similar to latest version... The magazine interface is good, but is laking of widget and customization.. I'm hoping on future versions that they allow us to select free feeds to add to the widgets since they only have a couple \"categories\" that I don't care that much like culture, bussiness, living, photos, travel.. etc... I don't see gaming or movies like on flipboard... and they only have twitter as a feed, I don't see facebook or instagram...\n\nApps: IOS has more tablet dedicated apps, but is not noticeable for my usage, email, youtube and browser are tablet friendly and that is what I use the most... facebook and all other work fine... even if they are phone versions... look and feel better than on my galaxy S4... android had the same problem with apps vs the app store a few years back and they catch up... they will do the same shortly with tablets.... Some apps doesn't work on my country like paper garden, milk music and most of the \"gift apps\" that come with the table... but is not a big deal for me...\n\nCamera: haven't use it... I don't care about it..\n\nFingerPrint scanner: This is a feature that I don't care that much but it Work 95% of the time... is a good ratio if you asked me... I heard some bad reviews that It never works... but is working fine for me...\n\nMulti-Users: this is great... you can have 2 users on the same tablet like on computers... I'm not sure if there is a feature like this on IOS but is perfect for me, since I can have 2 accounts... one for me and one for my GF....\n\nMulti tasking/ multi windows: Work perfect... this is another thing that IOS is missing... I was considering buying an Ipad Air over this... but even on IOS 8 there is no multi tasking... I use this a lot since I translate some documents... I had the translator app on top and the word app at the bottom and do my work directly from my galaxy tab S without even open my computer...\n\nBattery: I head so many great things... but I had to say that battery is average.... I will say same or even a little less than the Ipad... don't get me wrong.. it last the whole day with normal usage... but it drain out the battery fast when I use my torrent app... or when I download anything...\n\nUsage: perfect laptop replacement... I download some movies on it.. and watch them on any format... I have some movies and videos on my computer and I don't have to use the stupid itunes and a program to convert my avi movies to mp4 in order to transfer the movies to the tablet... I just simply copy them to my SD card.. and that's it... since I have Tab S I haven't use my computer only to do this review since involve a lot of typing... I'm just waiting for that keyboard case for this tablet and I'll be done.\n\nBottom line, is an excellent device if you plan to replace your laptop or use it less since is more confortable to do it from a tablet... I'm using my phone even less... since I prefer to browse facebook and twitter on the tablet than on the phone... the screen is amazing... better than any laptop/tablet I've ever seen... and the multi tasking and sd card slot are the catch that put me away from other IOS device... more tablet dedicated apps are coming daily on the play store... so is not a deal breaker over the ipad... and the ecosystem is getting in the right direction.. even touchwiz is looking better these days than previous versions....",

I then compared models on the Lenovo website and the 20QD0007US met my needs.  I needed a fast CPU, 16GB of memory and a 500GB SSD.  This model met my needs.  After we got it, the customization of Windows was easy.  I also found it easy to get my Office package installed.  The final change was to reduce the size of the Windows partition and install Linux along with it.  All pretty straight forward.  So far things are great.\nMy only \"issue\" was with the delivery.  It was shipped via UPS with a signature required.  That sounds logical.  However, for whatever reason, the UPS driver decided to skip my house and just mark the delivery as \"no one home\".  Well, I was home all day and no UPS driver.  I had to drive to a UPS Store the next day to pick it up.",

This has 1TB of space which is a good start for me ?? It\u2019s light weight but has a metal shell, so I don\u2019t have to worry as much about another screen cracking mysteriously (I had 2 laptops that became unusable because the screens mysteriously broke on both of them within a 2 month period). The computer is super fast and even though it says it\u2019s only 1080p I swear it looks as good as my 4K TV.\n\nNow for the cons:\nThe track pad is positioned on this to where I am constantly clicking it and getting the right click pop up menu, which is annoying but I\u2019m sure if I make adjustments it will be fine. It doesn\u2019t have a DVR for reasons unknown but it seems that a lot of newer computers don\u2019t come with one which can be annoying at times since I have a million and one DVRs laying around, everything  from movies to custom music \u201cmixtapes\u201d I\u2019ve made through the years but it\u2019s not a deal breaker or anything. For the price with the 1 TB SSD and the other things I was specifically looking for, it was a pretty good deal. The days of $300 laptops with everything you could want are over as precious minerals needed to make them become more scarce. Hopefully this will last me at least as long as my last one did which was around 8 years until my screen broke ??",

I run it on the high performance setting because, well, that's what I bought it for. It gets about 3.5 hours of battery before a warning with a fast shutdown.\n\nThe most surprising issue with this laptop is the identification of the keys. They aren't lighted and the color used for the letters and symbols is indistinguishable from the key in all but the most limited lighting situations. If you know your way around a keyboard without having to look for keys this isn't such a big deal but it is annoying.\n\nBattery life however is short at about 3.5 hours if not using the lower performance settings.\nI like the laptop but the keys are all but invisible.",

I'm thinking the 12GB of ram, 256 SSD (1-TB HDD) with the Ryzen 3 3250U chip made the difference. Photoshop Elements works like a charm and web-pages just snap into place. I don't do games, so can't speak to that. And last, this is my first ASUS computer, I'm impressed with the quality, fit and finish and the price was right. Happy with purchase.\n\nUpdate 4.14.21...

This time, however, the new machine came with an \"S\" code which means that ONLY MS software can be installed on it. The tech people insisted I run a diagnostic only AFTER which they admitted there was a software problem that they would need to fix. Timeline on that? Sometime between now and whenever. Meanwhile, critical non-MS software is unavailable to me. MS is very sorry for my inconvenience and lost work time and they will get back to me via email...someday.\n\nMeanwhile, the third party who sold me this electronic piece of fecal material told me to go whistle because their return policy was only for 30 days. Not their fault although they should at least warn people about the problem.\n\nFinally, there is only one USB port which is weird and annoying. This means I had to purchase and carry with me a dongle that supports additional ports. Also, the machine lacks niceties like a fingerprint sign on.

I nevertheless retained my affinity for the Windows operating system---so much so that when I purchased a MacBook Pro last year, I partitioned the disk and continued operating under Windows 10. I therefore greeted news of the Surface Laptop this spring---with its sleek and unitary design, and integration with other Microsoft products---with great enthusiasm. At last, I thought, the hardware would rise to the level of the software. The Surface Laptop would be Microsoft's answer to Apple.\n\nAlas, upon buying the machine (indeed, the highest-end model), I found myself severely disappointed.\n\nFirst of all, it ran noisy and hot right out of the box. Second, I could not even obtain a full-screen display on a standard Samsung external monitor (a defect which could not be resolved through a lengthy call to Microsoft Tech Support). How could Microsoft overlook such a basic requirement?\n\nAfter several hours of struggling I put the machine back in the box and returned it for a full refund.

The keyboard is very precise and comfortable, allowing for fast typing. Mouse and touch screen very accurate. The display is crisp with natural colors. Processor and SSD performance is ample. Beautiful detail solutions like the power supply plug and the additional USB charging port in the power supply add to the appeal. And the design is clean, minimalist, beautiful.\nI hope I will have this laptop for a very long time!",

If you had to go more than a day away from a standard outlet you would be SOL.  UPDATE 4/2019  I found a power cord aftermarket that solve the problem.

I prefer lighter keys because they help me type faster, but I've already gotten used to these ones.

There were a few that failed, then laptop continually crashed, had to re-build my profile twice. It slowly went downhill from there. None of the drivers would update. I know my way around a laptop (spent my career supporting workstations and laptops) so I started with the simplest fix and worked my way up. Could not reset or restore. Fortunately I purchased a warranty and they put me in touch with a very knowledgeable person at Microsoft and we re-built from scratch  to Windows 10 Pro (10.0.19042 build 19042). Everything has been fine for a while but now it randomly crashes with an error of \"WHEA uncorrectable error\" which fortunately doesn't harm my profile but is almost impossible to identify the cause. I've run tests on memory and the hard drive and they seem to be fine. Very annoying and unstable, and this is the laptop I have to use for the next few years?

With the surface laptop I ended up with a i7, 16gb ram it's a bit pricey but it's a work horse and probably best laptop I've had for travel.\n\nI do miss the sp4's ability to remove the keyboard and adjust the rear especially in the plane when I can stick it in the seat pocket. Also a bit getting used to having the dock/power mount on the bottom near the keys vs the screen on the sp4.\n\nThe bigger screen and better keyboard is a nice welcome after so many years with a surface pro\n\nFor power users I would also recommend the stylus, a usb3 Ethernet adapter as it also provides 3 usb3 slots and an 'active' mini displayport to HDMI .\n\nI do wish it had a usb-c slot sometimes .",

After downloading the updates it wouldn\u2019t install then since it\u2019s not plugged in. Well it\u2019s plugged in but it\u2019s got issues. So I took a can of air duster and pray the charging port a little and it did the trick and starting charging. After it installed the updates and rebooted. The charging issue was gone. This laptop is not upgradable. It scored a score of 0 out of 10 on ifixit. Don\u2019t game with it. You\u2019ll be disappointed. But light gaming will work fine like Minecraft. Surprisingly it was able to play GTA V decently. But I wouldn\u2019t push it. This is a very premium device. It looks great and feels great. You\u2019ll like the keyboard as well. I got the burgundy color. It looks really nice in person. So if you\u2019re in the market for one. I would avoid getting the ones with 4gb of ram. 8gb of ram is the sweet spot for today\u2019s use.",

I will not judge the actual item based on my poor experience with Amazon.\n\nThis laptop is great. I took naturally to the touchscreen, but you can function on the laptop without the touchscreen (I realize some people do not like to \"ruin\" the screen). Some things may bother you though.\n\nNO CD ROM. I lucked out in that I could download all the previous apps I had, but if you require a CD, you will need to buy an external CD ROM drive to run the apps, and to burn CD's.\n\nONLY 1 USB PORT. So I had to buy a splitter. Personally bought it to be able to use a mouse and keyboard, although I find it comfortable typing on the laptop's keyboard.\n\nOverall, I've had it for over a month and I love it.

                "review_body": "The last laptop that I had was the Lenovo Yoga 2 so it had Windows OS. When I was looking for a new laptop (I had my Lenovo for a little more than 4 years) I narrowed it down between the Microsoft Surface Laptop and the Google Pixelbook. Both laptops were around the same price (the Pixelbook is slightly cheaper than the Surface), with similar specs. At first, I was leaning more towards the Pixelbook because of the slightly cheaper price, but I didn't like that the Pixelbook was a 2-in-1 (my Lenovo is also a 2-in-1 and while I liked this feature at first, it ended up becoming a problem down the road). I also read some reviews about the Pixelbook that said there were some software issues. All the reviews that I read about the Surface were extremely positive with only minor complaints that seemed as though they would be irrelevant for me. Because I was relying heavily on past reviews (I live in the middle of nowhere and was not able to make the drive to view either laptop in person) I ended up going with the Surface despite the higher price and I have absolutely no regrets.\n\nThe Surface is sleek and smooth and I LOVE that there are multiple colors to choose from! The fabric-covered keyboard is sooo soft and smooth, and the laptop itself is unbelievably thin! The Surface ticks all the boxes for me, and although I cringed at spending this much on a laptop, I am so glad that I did!\n\nThe only thing that I would note is that there is only one USB port, which isn't an issue for me, but I know some people prefer more than one. Other than that, I can think of no complaints thus far.",

I needed something portable, quiet, and with good battery life because I am a college student. It's very light and I like the stylish design. I wanted a laptop that's aesthetically pleasing and has good specs. I can even play minecraft with my brothers without any issues. The laptop does get a bit hot when running minecraft or running multiple programs at once but the fans are always quiet usually making no noise at all. I went from a huge, heavy old dell to this laptop and it's great. It makes my life so much easier. Also on the power brick there is an extra USB port which I sometimes plug my phone into to charge. I've never seen that feature before and it's surprisingly handy.\n\nThe only issue I've had is with the trackpad. There's some visible wear on the trackpad already.  However, it doesn't really bother me as it's very minor and you can only really see it in a certain light. Other than that the trackpad has worked fine. A possible issue could be that there is only one USB port which I don't mind at all. But if you use more than one at a time then this laptop may not be for you.\n\nPros: Light, good battery, very quiet, fast, aesthetically pleasing, powerful considering it's lightweight design\nCons: trackpad wear, one usb port, gets hot when running multiple programs",

Works beautifully, reacts promptly, amazing touch screen, wakes up fast  and it is very light.  The keyboard is  backlit  so you can work in the dark and the  touch pad is a smooth as Apple's.  However, unlike Apple,  Microsoft is aggressively pushing  its own products.  The browser Edge works nicely and you can select which  search engine the  can use. (The default search engine is Bing.)  The AI helper Cortana uses only Bing. At  this moment  Cortana is less impressive than Google's Assistant. It is still very useful.\n\nMicrosoft is also offering a competitive cloud  cloud subscription.  At my job  I have to use Google cloud products (Drive,  Sheets, Documents). Also I have an Android Phone and  Google Photo  helps me sync my photo collection. These products  don't work as smoothly on the Surface.  At this moment you cannot even install the Chrome browser  on  Surface. (I read that Chrome is more energy consuming than Edge and can shorten the battery life.)  I do not need Microsoft cloud service since I already use two platform independent services  Google Drive and  Dropbox. I don't need  all the facilities of  Office 363 (the new Microsoft Office) since I can live very well with what  Google is offering freely.  I  don't know yet how Dropbox works with Surface.\n\nGiven the current deliberate  incompatibility with the Google products I need I gave Surface only four stars. If Microsoft  fixes this I will upgrade my rating to five stars  and switch to Surface.T hen again, I hear that Apple  will present this Fall the new generation of Mac Book Air.",

The design is sleek and simple, i was disappointed with the fact that it is difficult to find a simple laptop that doesn\u2019t cost an arm and a leg. All in all i liked the laptop, a lot! *The rating is for the product* not the for the story below\n\nHowever, the main purpose of this review is not about the laptop\u2019s performance, design etc... its about how I got scammed and was sent a laptop with specs that I didn\u2019t order.\n\nSo the story goes like this, i get on amazon, I add a Microsoft surface laptop (i5, 8 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD) to my cart, i place the order, several days later I get the package, i set up the laptop started checking it out. I had a feeling that i should check out the computer\u2019s spec, you know just curious. I was shocked when i found out that the specs of the laptop were (i5, 4 GB RAM and 128 GB SSD!!!!!!!) i was really confused, i double check the label on the back of the box and saw that it says (i5, 8GB RAM, 256 GB SSD), but the laptop has different specs, and what is more confusing is that the serial number of the laptop matches the number on the box. So to me it seemed like it was an attempt to pull a quick one on me. I ended up returning the laptop of course... I am still disappointed that such scam attempts could happen on amazon!\n\nCheck your laptops everyone! Don\u2019t get scammed like i did.",

The palm rests have a cloth feeling but they are made of some plastic stuff that's easily cleaned, the screen looks great, and the keyboard feels right... partly due to the palm rests allowing a person to rest palms on them while typing. It has a fast hard drive, it's quiet and light. I really don't have negatives to say about it except that it only has a couple of USB 3 ports. That's OK...

Remember around the time of the first iphone, the Windows Phones on AT&T?  What a mess.  Remember trying to update them?  The Surface line of tablets have actually been pretty good, but in the end most people either just want a really good tablet or a good laptop.  The surface laptops have filled a nice need which is a speedy laptop that is super slim and can act like a tablet as well.  As long as you get the model with at least a core i5, 8 gigs of RAM and 256 SSD, the surface laptop performs great.  You can hold it with 2 or 3 fingers and fits in a tablet sleeve.  I have one of these myself and we have sold about 20 of them for our employees and clients and have had very few issues so far.  The finish on the laptop looks nice, but it can show some fingerprints or new to be wiped off after a lot of use.  The reason I am taking off a star is because of the confusion and frustration of having these laptops ship with Windows 10 S.  I won't bore you with what Windows 10 S is, suffice to say that it is a stripped down version meant for large rollouts and not suitable for most people.  It's true that you can switch to Windows 10 Pro for free, but it's super confusing for people that don't know how or why they need to do that.  Overall while not perfect, for the price the surface laptop is a great choice.",

Printing is important, and I felt the 2 stars was deserved for a product I might have had to return.\n\nAfter a few hours of working with it, I was able to resolve my problem.  This is what I experienced.  Your Surface may not experience the same issue.  It might have been a one off, or a bug of some kind.\n\nMy 5 existing computers had the \"Workgroup\" name changed to \"XXXXXXXXX\".  After updating the Surface to WIndows Pro at the Microsoft Store, I changed the \"Workgroup\" name to match the other 5.  At that point, it failed to connect to a shared printer.  Long story short, I set the \"Workgroup\" name back to \"WORKGROUP\" on the Surface and the computer with the printer attached, and it worked!\n\nSo, I changed the \"Workgroup\" name back to \"XXXXXXXXX\" on those 2 computers, and it failed to connect to the shared printer again!\n\nI changed all 6 computers so the \"Workgroup\" is named \"WORKGROUP\" and all is good.  This should not have been an issue, but I'm glad I got mine working.\n\nWe love the laptop.  It has a great screen size, it is light, and it is quick.  Not excited with my support call with Microsoft, but the important thing is it works now.\n\nORIGINAL POST:\nIt started off really nice.  Fast, smooth, it looks great, etc.  Then I tried to connect it to a shared printer on another computer in my home.  It failed.  Over and over again.  I called Microsoft.  The young lady was patient and nice, but went through a series of tests that had nothing to do with my issue.  I requested my call be escalated, and after a few minutes, she came back on and tried a few additional steps.\n\nShe had me connect the printer directly to the laptop.  It worked (Who saw that coming????)!  Then she said \"we have it working.  Is there anything else we can do for you?\"  I could have done this.  The laptop REFUSES to recognize a shared printer on the network.  I have a Surface Pro 3, a Surface 1, an HP desktop and an HP laptop, ALL which can connect to the printer that is USB'd to another HP desktop.  Microsoft basically REFUSED to escalate my issue even after I said I was sending it back.\n\nIt's sad to give it a 2 star rating for a printer issue, but we like to print.  It is not an option.  Someone might say it is a printer issue.  It is not.  There is a network sharing issue with \"MY\" Surface Laptop.  Maybe not yours, but mine has an issue.  It is also sad that Microsoft wouldn't at least attempt to resolve this.\n\nI may return this if I can't find a printer solution.  I'll update in a couple of weeks.",

                "review_body": "I'm only writing this to warn off anyone from purchasing a surface laptop--lord know I'll never buy one. I bought the laptop two years ago. The surface worked fine for the first year, though I had periodic charging issues, especially with the magnetic cable clip. The clip won't engage, sometimes you have to prop it up or tape it. The problems got worse, and just when the warranty expired (a year and half), I had major issues charging the laptop. So I bought another cable, which worked for a while, then bought another, and the problem continued. I had two conversations with microsoft techs, who convinced me to buy another cable--considering, if I wanted to send the laptop for repair, the price would be more than I paid for it, so they really gave me no possible solutions, other than buying a new one, and were really gaslighting me that any fix actually existed. Of course, why would I ever purchase another microsoft product. The Lenovo laptop, which I bought the Surface to replace it with, is still working five years later--only issue I had is with a hinge.\n\nI've taken it to various repair shops and they tell me there's nothing they can do to fix it, that basically, microsoft made the surface to be disposable, and any effort to fix the laptop would far exceed the price to purchase a new one--planned obsolescence. From what I researched, what brought about the charging issue was some update I failed to download, and once the battery lost power,  it couldn't be charged, or even powered with the cable plugged in.\n\nI've given up on this pos. I'm looking for a field where I can take it out and demolish it like the printer from Office Space, or possibly a parking garage I can drop it from. Maybe a wood chipper. I'm weighing my options. All said, don't buy a surface laptop, this is where you'll be two years later.",

After weeks of research and stress trying to find the perfect laptop I stumbled upon this beauty. It was worth the wait and stress or research. It's amazing.\n\nThe keyboard is out of this world. It's so comfortable to type on. I love it.\n\nThe i7 core processor is amazing. I can run Photoshop, Spotify and a bunch of browsers without it slowing down.\n\nBattery life is phenomenal.\n\nThe screen is great. The touch screen works amazingly too.\n\nI got the Burgundy and it's even cuter in person. It's sort of punk pinkish. I love it. The material on the inside is nice, I'm not sure how it will wear eventually but in the meantime it's been great and comfortable.\n\nYou won't regret your purchase!\n\nEDIT: almost 2 years later and this computer still works like a charm!!! the fabric inside isn\u2019t worn down and i work from home on it, literally 8 hours a day m-f for the last 2 years! it\u2019s not as new looking, but still in pretty great shape! still runs super fast, amazing. battery life isn\u2019t as strong but not a deal breaker",

                "review_body": "UPDATE: So, I'm about two weeks in now and have had a bit of time to run a few photoshoots into my Lightroom catalog to get an idea of what this laptop can handle and I'm a bit less than ecstatic. I'm not knocking a star off because Adobe recommends 12gb of ram to run Lightroom smoothly, so its no fault to Microsoft that I started to have some slow-downs when I got my catalog up around 1,000 images with synced settings, 1:1 previews, and adjustments gradients and brushes on many files. I've got my cache set to 90gb and it just tends to really chug when I need to do more than basic adjustments. Outside of heavy lightroom use and sluggishness, the laptop absolutely flies with just about anything else. I really don't have a complaint to share. It's been a dream.\n\nThis laptop is fantastic. I bought the i5 256/8gb model with the gray/gold coloring. First thing that amazes is the weight. Just over two pounds makes this thing feel so incredible to carry around. I almost feel like it's a large phone sometimes. The design is sleek and minimalist. The speakers are loud and full and rich. The battery life is is superb. I may have a warped view on that because of the terrible battery on my old laptop, but I seem to notice 7-8 hours battery life depending on the usage. I bought this for Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop use, but haven't had much time to put it through a lot of work so I will update when I know just how well it performs there.\n\nThe only minor dislike is that the hinge is a little wobbly. For being touchscreen, it seems like it should have a stiffer hinge, but it's quite bouncy.",

                "review_body": "I've had this laptop for about three months, and this is the second laptop (after the Rose Gold MacBook), that I have looked forward to using day in and day out. It is a weird feeling, being in love with your laptop. Most of us have probably own at least 6 laptops in our lifetimes, so you can understand where I'm coming from when I say most of us use our laptops in a utilitarian sort of way: We use it because we need to, and when we don't, we just put it away without any thought. If you want a big screen, or to play games, you would use your desktop. When you want something portable, you would most likely use your tablet. When you want something on the go, we have all used our smartphone as our main day-to-day gadget. So that leaves our laptop, as more of a business machine for doing something that requires typing on the go, whether it be to reply to an important email you can't just use your phone for, or to type out something on Word or Google Docs. For many of us, browsing the Net just isn't as satisfying on our small phones, even if it is some 6.2\" monster. There is something tactile, yet intangibly indescribable, about using our laptop\n\nYet, this is the first Windows laptop that makes me look forward to using it each day. The main culprit: Oh that gorgeous piece of metal and color. To be honest, if it just came in silver like its Surface Book counterpart, I would have never given it a second thought (by the way, I have that too, but its novelty has since worn off). I got the Burgundy version, which is just so unique - where else can you get a wine red laptop?? Each time I open its laptop sleeve and pull it out, I have to pause a moment to admire its chiseled look first, before propping it open and using it. Not only does it look great, it feels great too. As you run your fingers through it, you will appreciate that you have one of the most luxurious laptops ever. No that is not a hyperbole.\n\nAnother thing that make it stands out: The stereo speakers underneath the keyboard is the best I have ever heard in a laptop (I am overseas right now, and my Huawei Matebook X awaits at home with its Dolby Atmos Harmon Kardon speakers, so I'll do an update soon). It is loud and immersive - it can't get too loud where it would create aural distortions, so at its peak it is just awesomely loud and clear enough. I have a keyboard protector over it, but I always take it off when I have some audio playing - yes, the sound is that good.\n\nTouchscreen laptops might be a gimmick, but having it is never a negative. It is perfect for scrolling web sites. Once you use it that way, you'll never go back to scrolling with your mouse or trackpad again.\n\nSpeaking of the trackpad, it's supposed to have the Windows Precision software aspect, but it still is goofy most of the time. Scrolling, switching, zooming, etc., still isn't as good as any MacBooks.\n\nAnd speaking of the keyboard and keyboard cover, key travel and sponginess are excellent. However, the keys are a bit more slippery than I would like, so I definitely recommend one of those gel keyboard covers to help you type more precisely.\n\nThe screen is bright and excellent - one of the best screens I have used. The resolution isn't as crisp and nice as my Surface Book and Macbook, but definitely better than most.\n\nAbout that whole Alcantara-layered interior - yes it is beautiful, yes it feels great (no more cold palms in the winter). Just keep it clean (no eating potato chips while using it).\n\nFinally, the i5 and 8GB of RAM are good enough to avoid any hiccups in performance of your every usage of a normal laptop. This is not for gaming or video rendering, so if you are not expecting that, then this laptop's performance will not disappoint.\n\nThe bottom line is you will buy this laptop for its looks, period. There is no value for this laptop - it is targeted as a premium-level laptop, not a value-level laptop. Any other normal laptop with these specs would be about $200 less. So you just have to ask yourself if the burgundy or slate blue color, and the style of design/craftsmanship are worth it for you.",

                "review_body": "I bought this laptop in June of 2019.  This is the 1st generation of the Surface laptop and I got it for a great price because the 2nd generation was rolling out.  My Surface laptop is Cobalt Blue with the Core i7, 8GB RAM, and 256GB hard drive.  Got it for $725.  This was a great price in my mind and why I went with it.  I was looking at some cheaper laptop models (in the $400-$500) range, and wasn't really considering this level of laptop because it is normally in the $1000-$1500 range.  But at $725 I decided to pay a bit extra for the better quality.\n\nOne of the most notable differences of moving up to a laptop like this is the design.  It is nice and slim, and looks great.  This was important to me because I wanted something fairly sleek and compact that I could just put in my backpack and go (not a student, but I always have my pack).\n\nThe screen is great and I love the 3:2 aspect ratio.\n\nAs I'm typing this review, I can tell you that the keyboard is as good as people say it is.  It's got great spacing and the button press is nice and deep for a laptop.  This was big because I'm used to typing on a mechanical keyboard.  The Alcantera surface is a nice touch.  It is a smooth and soft feel and is something that separates it from competition.  Some people have stated that it leaves some oil marks after months of use, but I've mostly seen that in the light grey color.  We'll see what it does having the darker blue color.\n\nThe touchscreen works great.  I haven't purchased a Surface pen, but plan to in the future.  The trackpad is also great and gives a nice satisfying click.\n\nThe facial recognition for login is accurate and really fast.\n\nI will typically use my Bluetooth earbuds, but I was surprised at how clear and nice the speakers on this sounded.\n\nOverall, this laptop looks and feels like a great laptop and performs very well.  I have had a Macbook Air for my job for the last 2 years, and this is just as good a laptop. In fact, it is probably a bit better because of the little things like a better keyboard and personalized colors.  At the price I got it for, I would definitely recommend this laptop.\n\nAlso, I should state that a lot of reviews for this laptop talk about the Windows S operating system being installed on it.  That is no longer the case.  My laptop came pre-loaded with Windows 10 Pro.",

                "review_body": "Okay, so far running well however, if this is a \u201cNew\u201d laptop that has been updated why does it have a Knick on the cover?! In addition, when looking at the Warranty, it says that I have 4 months, give or take a few days, left on it. You have to ask yourself that if it\u2019s a New laptop, then why is a 1 year mandatory Warranty left with only 4 months?! The above description is deceiving and should not be allowed. No where on the original description of the product on Amazon does it indicate that it\u2019s a \u201cused\u201d laptop or that it\u2019s a New Lenovo ideapad 3 8Gb with 256 or 512 Gb RAM\u201d that is being updated to 20 Gb with 1Tb\u201d. It states that they are \u201cNew\u201d! This needs to be corrected and a clear precise description of what the purchaser is actually buying needs to replace what is currently on Amazon. It so far appears to be a good product and if the company is filling a demand and pricing it accurately, should be honest and forthright about their product unless they have something to hide. I would love a response to the questions posed here as I do not have immediate plans on returning the laptop as long it continues to function as it should. I will continue to update this review to keep customers informed.\nUpdate:\nAfter 10 months of owning this computer, realized the battery does not hold the charge. You can charge it completely one day and a week later, you need to plug it in because it\u2019s threatening to shut off. They added some things and forgot others, like an updated battery or maybe it was done on purpose since we all know that they were not honest enough to inform potential buyers that their computers were technically used.",

When you have been spoiled by SSDs it's really hard to go back to HDDs.  I have since purchased 5 SSD's to replace the antiquated HDD that is currently installed on the laptops. What started out as a deal on some good equipment has turned into a need to upgrade immediately after purchasing and replacing parts that should be a lot more modern and ready to run current OS specs, especially since that's how it was shipped. Very disappointed in the performance.\n\n*****UPDATE*****\n\nI have installed the memory (32 GB) and the SSDs (480 GB). The computers are running much better and are very efficient.

With this laptop I could play Cyberpunk in ultra with no lag to give an example of how good it is.\n\nNow I'm going to mention the things I don't like. But this is mostly stuffs with ASUS.\n\nIt heats a lot. It can easily go to 90\u00b0C very fast. Of course, this laptop have some configurations to speed up / activate the fans which can hold it and I won't go father than that. Also, most games won't have this problem. You can always buy a cooling pad so this isn't big deal.\n\nThe battery. Just working as a programmer works around 2-3 hours using linux on balance. Gaming last around 1-2 hours depending on what you are playing. If you use the special configurations on windows it can last a bit more but isn't a big difference.\n\nThe screen of the laptop have some weird colors. You can make some configurations but it won't look perfect. My old laptop had a better quality screen. It has a HDMI so you can avoid this problem an use a real monitor.\n\nDespite this little problems, I'm very happy with what I brought.",

                "review_body": "This is a great, powerful machine. My word of caution is that its battery life is awful. On battery saving mode with the touchscreen turned off, an hour of light programming depletes a third of the battery. This is likely due to its powerful processor combined with the display. I could see this being a good fit for someone who will primarily use it at a workstation where it\u2019s constantly connected to power, or someone who is usually near an outlet to charge.\n\nAdditionally, the computer gets very hot after an hour of use. I would suggest getting a cooling fan or elevating it so the fans on the bottom can circulate a bit more. This is also likely due to the compact case in addition to the powerful processor. This leads me to believe the processor power is not being fully utilized due to the heating issues.\n\nIf you already have a bigger machine and are getting this for on-the-go, I would go for the i5 and the base display. The display quality won\u2019t matter on this size and you won\u2019t notice the difference in processor speeds because of the overheating issues I mentioned earlier.\n\nOverall, it\u2019s a beautiful machine and I love the size and weight of it. It feels solid and the display quality is amazing. I can have multiple IDEs open, running a local dev server, tests, and browse the web without worrying about lag. I use it mostly at home on the couch or in bed, with it plugged in so the battery problem sucks but isn\u2019t a dealbreaker. The cooling issue is something I have with my MacBook Pro as well, so a cooling fan has been a good investment regardless.",

This laptop just looked so premium in features and appearance. However, you could feel so much heat coming from the bottom that in half an hour I couldn't bear it upon my legs. And the most important downside was, it had really poor battery performance. It couldn't last more than 3 hours of battery life, even sometimes lasted only 2 and a half hours just using web browsing. No video streaming or any other demanding application. I contacted Dell and they said that this is the battery life time it is supposed to have (which I don't entirely believe, and contradicted what they say in their product website). They changed battery and problem still persisted. At the end they proposed to change both hard disc and motherboard, when in that point, I finally decided to return it to the seller for receiving full refund. It was heartbreaking for me to return it because I loved this laptop. However, this battery issue was unacceptable for me because it completely took any portability off from the laptop. I don't know whether any other laptop of this model has the same issue or I just got unlucky.",

I was super disapointed, I really loved this computer otherwise, but a glitchy screen isn't worth the money even with so much gaming power behind it.\n\nAlso this thing runs WAAAY hot. like 175 degrees Fahrenheit hot and it only stays below that on 'silent' mode so there's no point to running it in turbo cuz youd melt the keyboard.

After spending dozens of hours on forums reading about 100's of people with the same problem, it's not clear if it's just janky hardware, or Asus just can't get the BIOS to work properly with the card.  Every time windows updates, be prepared for endless wi-fi problems which will eventually be fixed by a BIOS update from Asus.  Asus refuses to acknowledge the problem, and will not send you a replacement card.  Their customer service completely stonewalled me, and pretended they had never heard of the problem before, even though it's been going on for over a year now.  The only real fix seems to be to just get an intel ax200 replacement.  They're around $30.  Obviously not a huge expense, but ALOT of time wasted with Asus customer service getting no result, then hours spent on the forums trying to solve it myself.  Won't buy an Asus again.",

I have had issues for the last month with the machine crashing/locking up sporadically with increasing frequency. I thought it might be a bad video display driver. So, I made sure everything was up-to-date but the problem persisted. I did a few system restores, some from the local Windows copy and some from the cloud.  I spent a lot of time trying to isolate what the problem might be. While this was going on, I noticed disk errors starting to show up in the System event logs. At this point, I really thought it is a hardware issue. I reached out to Asus for support and they sent me a link to create an RMA. However, when I tried to create an RMA, it said I needed to go to Best Buy. I went to Best Buy and, even though I am a Total Care member, they would not honor the warranty because I did not buy the laptop there.  I reached out to \"Lucky Tech, LLC\" about this and they directed me back to Best Buy, even though I clearly told them in writing on multiple occasions that \"Best Buy would not honor the warranty because I did not buy the laptop.\" The only thing that makes sense is that they are reselling laptops they buy from Best Buy and the warranty is not transferrable.\n\nBottom line, I am the proud owner of a $1700 boat anchor.

                "review_body": "Worth every penny. I'm actually writing the review on this laptop (physically using) 8 months later! So needless to say I have broken it in. Full disclosure, I modded this right out of the box. I added in an additional M.2 for another 2TB of space and upgraded to 64GB (2x32) of RAM. The SSD and RAM ran me about $250 (USD) and it was breeze to install. The laptop runs great, no cooling issues, no frame drops or lag. I cannot speak to the battery life because this lives on the desk next to my workstation and I have not traveled with it. But lets be honest, no one games aggressively at the coffee shop. If you are playing an intense, power demanding game you are likely sitting at home. If you don't want the bulk of a PC tower and you want to sit anywhere in the house on your computer than this is the best there is for you. The cherry on top is that this is from ASUS and in over 10 years of using their products I have nothing but great things to say about the company and what they produce.",

                "review_body": "This is the second ASUS machine I have tried to use.  The first machine was returned due to a problem with the WIFI being totally inoperable.  I fought with that machine for about a week before returning it.\nAs I really like the first machine overall, I decided to give the ASUS TUF series another try and went with a bit of an upgrade from the first machine.\nInitial start up and Windows 10 set up went flawless and easy.  Wifi connected quick easy and fast.  From my first experience I was able to go through and do a lot of basic setup with the ASUS utilities and basic Windows preferences.\nEverything worked fine until the first BIOS update to version 309 installed.  After that the wifi became quite erratic.  It might or might not connect.  When it doesn't connect, the wifi won't display any networks at all.  In some cases the hardware will shut down and there won't even be a WiFi option.\nPros\nIt is a big screen and decent keyboard.  Backlighting is somewhat programmable for overall color and there are apparently some basic special effects that can be turned on with the ASUS Armory Crate utility.  In this instance the machine came with 16G of memory, 6G of graphics memory and a 1T SSD.  I never really got to try out the gaming or usability of the machine as the WiFi not working is a deal breaker.\n\nCons\nThe NUM LOCK key has no visual light or marker to indicate if it is on or off.  A small LED like the Caps Lock would have been fine, but it has none so you have to find out the hard way.\nOnce all the basic Windows 10 stuff is set up from original install/set up the machine runs quite well and was a lot faster than the first machine I had.  When Windows 10 starts doing the upgrades/updates, DO NOT ALLOW THE BIOS UPDATES!!!!!!!!!!!  The WiFi problems are due to faulty bios starting with versions 309.  Versions 310 and 312 completely shut down the ability for the wifi to work at all.  If you don't have a Cat5 cable to plug in for internet, you will be out of luck.\n\nHeat.  This is a powerful machine and the processors generate a lot of heat.  There should have been some kind of built in stand offs on the underside to give more air space under the fans.  As it is designed it sets too close to a smooth flat table for enough air to flow.  It really needs a laptop cooler if you plan on doing any real gaming.  If it has about 3/4 of an inch under the machine at the top end, it seems to stay fairly cool if you have the fans running at all.  (I actually can't hear them myself)\n\nI will probably be returning this to Amazon.  I would not recommend ANY of the ASUS computers at this time due to the BIOS WiFi issue.  For me, the lack of WiFi access makes this a boat anchor.  Of course ASUS isn't really saying anything about this ocean liner slamming into an iceberg.\nBe aware that there are a lot of \"make do\" fixes online for the ASUS WiFi issue.  I suspect it is going to be worse before it is better.\nThe first machine started having problems the first evening.  Through the following week the WiFi became more and more erratic until it just wouldn't work at all.\nAt this point THIS macnine is ONE DAY OLD and the wifi is completely shut down.",

Because It\u2019s also very fast at editing video.\n\nIt has a great feature that automatically switches between the default Intel GPU (energy/battery saving) for everyday tasks and switches to using the discrete NVIDIA RTX3060 (performance) in games and heavy video editing.  You can manually specify in the NVIDIA Experience app to run specific games ONLY using the NVIDIA GPU because sometimes it will try to use the slower default GPU. For most windows tasks the Intel GPU is great.\n\n It does run hot, so I would recommend a laptop cooler if you going to play demanding games. The fans do a great job at pumping the heat outside the laptop. However, It must have plenty of ventilation underneath to allow proper airflow. Extremely warm air is ejected from three places (left side rear, right side rear and right side.\n\nThe fans (x2) when in silent mode are just that \u2026 silent. However in turbo mode they are very loud. Not a big deal for me because I use noise canceling headphones that totally eliminate the fan noise.\n\nI upgraded the RAM in this laptop soon after purchase from 16GB (2x8GB) to 32GB (2x16GB). This is the kit I purchased and confirm that they run at full 3200MHz speeds with timings of CL 20 RCD 22 RP 22 RAS 42 on a JDEC profile.\n\nKingston FURY Impact 32GB (2x16GB) 3200MHz DDR4 CL20 Laptop Memory Kit of 2 KF432S20IBK2/32, Black\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B097QJ25NY?psc=1&ref=ppx_pop_mob_b_asin_image\n\nHope this helps.",

In the last five years of my career, this truly has been the best laptop I have used. It's fast, it's got a beautiful image resolution, it's lightweight, and there hasn't been a single issue with it in the last two years. Even being a Apple/IOS over-consumer, I prefer using this laptop over my personal mac computer because the software doesn't get outdated as fast, the camera is better, it's overall clearer, brighter and more sleek in my opinion.\n\nThe laptop keyboard includes buttons to easily lock the camera off so I don't have to worry about accidentally turning my camera on in a meeting when I'm still in my pjs. For similar reasons, I also like that there's a mute button on the keyboard as well as volume & brightness keys. My millennial brain still needs the satisfaction of a clicking-key keyboard and I'm able to use my usb/bluetooth paired keyboard & mouse without issues.\n\nThe price is not ideal but like I said, I'm saving up to buy one for my own personal use because I can't recommend this laptop enough!",

Spoke to Amazon, got a replacement, same result so it was not a one-off bad wireless card. Returned the replacement got refund. Also, this laptop never recognized my 5G connection either.

It comes with an 8th gen intel core I5 processor, 8 GB of ram and 128 gigs. It is very light weight and that is good because carrying that around campus in the summers, when it is over 110 degrees can be challenging. If you fly all the time you will appreciate this laptop because it is easy to carry. I love the infinity edge, the retna display on the camera and the battery life. What I don't love is the keyboard, it is a bit mushy and with Dell, upgrades are expensive like apple. I was going to get it from amazon but Dell offered a lower price, with my military discount. I was able to get this when it came out for $900 out the door. I highly recommend this notebook I am not a play video games on my laptop guy but you can use it for that, of course there are better laptops if that is what you want. This is perfect for the student or businessperson who wants a professional looking laptop. I also picked the silver color because it looks nice.

The SSD is a bit small but I always upgrade the SSDs anyway on these laptops to the fastest ones on the market. Mine was shipped in two days with free shipping to Hawaii. So far no problems with it and it indeed is brand new with a 14-month warrantee from Dell.\n\nBeware as a lot of deals on Ebay are actually refurbs for around the same price. Also a lot of the sales and promos direct from Dell you need to check the fine print as many of the 8th Gen XPS laptops do not include a touchscreen.\n\nThat being said, due to the small 13\" screen size for best use of the touchscreen you need a stylus not unless you have real small fingers. In the same vein, getting the QHD screen in touchscreen is a waste of time and not worth the extra bucks.\n\nUpdate: Downgraded to 3 stars because I finally got around to running CrystalMark 6.0 on this machine, only to find out that at 500/500 R/W speeds, the vendor installed a SATA III drive, not an NVME PCIE drive, which comes pretty much standard on computers sold in 2018. The ad here on Amazon is carefully worded to state only \"SSD\", with no indication it is the faster and more commonly used NVME drives, that is why I am giving it 3 stars for deception. I am currently in the process of upgrading to a 1 TB NVME PCIE drive, which I got for $270 (they normally run close to $400 but prices are continuing to drop).",

My previous Acer laptop was half the price and had an i3 processor, but ran leaps and bounds quieter, and just as \"snappy\" when browsing or running apps. Also certain keys on the keyboard are not very responsive. The period key (\".\") seems to be particularly bad, and I keep missing it when trying to navigate web pages. Very frustrating.

This is a 4th computer in the household to be used in my room mainly at night, so that feature was important to me. Also, as another reviewer posted, I was told I would have to sign for it. At least she got a doorbell ring. Mine was left on the side of the house ~ not even a ring. Good thing I was home and tracked it right to the house.",

But the price of parts put the rig I wanted out of my budget this time 'round.  As I researched box rigs, the iBuyPower name popped up several times,\n\nI finally found the Tracer MR at BestBuy of all places and I couldn't believe the set up for the price!  Reviews good, price good, build good - so I pulled the trigger.  Setup was pretty easy and this thing is QUIET for all the fans it's running.\n\nAt this point my only complaint is the RGB synching software.  The version that shipped caused antivirus to block and stop it.  I downloaded the latest version and only have control of the external fans and RAM.  All in all though, I don't care much about RGB and will most likely just shut it all off.\n\nThis is a very solidly built rig.  Packed right, decent setup instructions, and it fired right up.  I am a fan and have high hopes for th next couple years!",

Wanted to have the minimum amount of accessories. Unfortunately, since the trackpad died, I'm going to have to get a mouse.\n\nAlso, the fingerprint ID feature is really unreliable. If it doesn't work the first time, forget additional attempts, they don't work either. Then, instead of asking for your PASSWORD, the notebook asks you for your PIN. You aren't given the option of password or pin. IOW the security features on this device are a hassle. The touch ID is unreliable & the lack of options on answering an alternate security feature that you have actually memorized kind of blow with a computer that is your primary carry-around device. If I'm taking the computer out of the house, I want security features enabled. I want them to work like they are supposed to & not obstruct ME, the owner, from getting onto the device.",

                "review_body": "Returning this piece of junk after less than an hour out of the box. It looked shiny and new, but Amazon's refurbishment \"experts\" clearly have no expertise whatsoever. The PC was running incredibly slowly (far worse than the one I was trying to replace, which is suuuuper old), froze every time I tried to download software (all I attempted was Firefox and AVG Antivirus, I didn't get any farther than that). I had to do a hard shutdown with the power button after each download in order to access the installation file in my \"downloads\" folder because of the system freeze, and then the machine would freeze again if I tried to run the installation - these little installation wizards normally fire right up and take all of two minutes to complete. When I tried aborting the frozen process via the task manager, the PC would go totally blank (screen turns white, nothing on it, and again have no option but to shut down with the power button and then try again). I did six hard shutdowns in half an hour, trying to install the most basic functionality software. The 10 year old refurbed Lenovo I bought in a parking lot from a guy on Craigslist a year and a half ago works vastly better. The power cable that came with this machine (which, by the way, is super short, which might be an issue for a lot of people even buying the same computer new from the manufacturer) was in a crumpled mess in the box, so it doesn't seem like they're really trying to even create the appearance of professionalism. All Amazon's \"renewal\" program did was tie up $650 of my money for a while (I'll get the refund sometime after they receive the returned machine, supposedly...). I definitely won't be buying any product that Amazon is involved in making or refurbishing again, and when I get my money back, I'll just buy a brand new machine with less impressive specs for the same price - discounted pricing for better specs is useless if the machine doesn't actually work.",

I did add memory (two additional banks) and a SSD drive (500MB) so it is probably as fast as a new model. The hard drive also works well as my backup storage since all I needed was a case for it. Best of all, it has both a VGA and a HDMI port for output... very handy for interfacing to older projectors and older video equipment. HDMI to older video equipment is always a big question. I use to carry five different types of adapters and hoped one would work. Now the E5410 works every time... YES!\n\nYou could probably spend a lot more but this is a great solid piece of gear that will do well on the road or in the office...

This happened to me on multiple occassions since I received the laptop, but not all the time.  It seems that it freezes randomly.\n\nI would normally suspect something new with the machine that is causing the problem, since I upgraded from a lesser machine recently.  For example, maybe it's Windows 7 Professsional or Office 2007.  This is not the case since I had the exact same operating system and applications on my previous laptop.\n\nOn a positive note, I really like the integrated mouse features, as you can customize them however you like.

The other time I use it is for traveling on a plane to watch downloaded movies. I keep it in a padded case when not in use. I bought this Flying Tech tablet 6 months ago to replace my older Samsung. It worked well enough for the games.  I had a pattern lock on the device.  I took the tablet on a trip in August, used it on one leg of the trip, then when returning I pulled the tablet out, and the pattern lock would not unlock. I didn't forget the pattern and it had been in the case.  Now I have tried many times to unlock but am unable.  All info on the web says I need to factory reset.  So I have followed all the directions and get to the reboot screen but there is not an option to factory reset. The last time I tried I got a screen full of chinese characters so I just shut down the tablet.  Now I don't know what to do with it.  What a waste of money.  I just wanted a simple device to place games and movies on.",

Its incredibly light and it's fast enough for any basic life tasks, can play your basic games, and in battery saver + mode can do what I need it to do. I've gotten over 10 hours in battery saver plus just streaming movies, it looks and feels great. The screen is excellent but as other have said the built in speakers are sub par. I don't knock it for this because I don't really know of a scenario that this matters to me. I use earbuds when I travel and if I'm using this at home I would just use stream the audio through a speaker if in some universe I need to play music or something.\n\nHighly recommend if you're looking for a good looking, ultra light, long lasting laptop.",

Built-in mic stopped working a few days ago. Not sure what happened really as the mic appears to be installed but I tried with dozens of drivers and I have given up. I have read some people have had audio/mic issues with this laptop. Not sure if it is software of hardware problem, though. Most likely won't be sending it back since it's international shipping but just be aware that this may be an issue. Nothing that a good set of headphones cannot solve.

                "review_body": "So when I was looking for a decent gaming laptop, I made an unprecedented turn to Lenovo.  I've never bought from them before, but with the deal (it was on sale) and the configuration, and honestly the reputation in the professional world, I decided to give them a try.\n\nThe good:  It is a 2019 era laptop, it (to me) was bought when they were starting to ship the 20 series nVidia gfx, literally if I waited 3 months, they were out..  That being said, the mobile 1660Ti is an amazing card and the i79750H packs a punch.  I mean, until you get to the bad part of this, the system \"IS\" really good.  Not too heavy, not too light (it is a performance laptop...) and a good screen on the LCD.  A real win.  Until.......\n\nThe bad:  Exactly 2 months after warranty expired (1 year warranty), one of the fans started making noise, then within days of infrequent use, stopped.  I tracked down the part number for the fan to replace it (helpful and useful info available on the Lenovo site, yea!!).  They use this company called encompass for all their official parts sales (this is the BIGGEST PROBLEM).  The part was ordered, and long story short, took over 6 months (ordered in October, received part in april, no joke).  This ONLY happened after I called Lenovo after several contact attempts with Encompass, who at one point CANCELED my order, only to then jack the price of the heatsink/fan combo (more on that later) from 58 to 89 dollars.  After complaining to Lenovo that they canceled my order and jacked the price up, my original ticket was reopened at the original price.  Still took 1.5 months (6 weeks) for a part to show up.  When it did, IT WAS USED!!  Had old thermal paste on it, but at that point I just didn't care, I used it as I was desperate to use my gaming laptop.  Mid April I installed my 'new to me, pad for new, got a used part' heatsink/fan.  3 weeks ago (so 2.5 months) IT DIED AGAIN.\nI contacted encompass and did get an RMA, which I sent my bad unit back to them, at which they would send me a \"new\" replacement.  Guess what..  Shipping date ALREADY moved back 2 times, and now is saying the same thing it said the first time, \"NO ETA - FACTORY BACKORDER\".  I bet actual Lenovo tech's have no problem getting the part..  But I digress..  So two funny sidenotes about this.  1.  Encompass current price for the originall 58, then 89 dollar unit?  $160 bucks.  BOY has that thing gone up in price.  Funny bit #2?  The fan they use is actually a VERY common fan.  It is used on MANY HP, DELL, ACER and ASUS (if not more) laptops.  The difference is that Lenovo uses some form of plastic injection molding/melting process so the heatsink and fan are ONE assembly, whereas most other manufacturers use screws so at least if the fans fails, a tech or customer can easily remove the fan(s) alone and not have to replace the fans AND heatsink assembly.  To Lenovo's credit, it does seem at least one other version of the Y series laptop does in fact use removable fans, but I'm unable to tell if it was before or after this design.\nIt is simply for this reason I absolutely cannot recommend this product.  I shouldn't have to complain to Lenovo about their official parts supplier.  I shouldn't have to endlessly wait for 6 months once, and who knows how many more months for the next one to ship, based on my previous experience with them, this still practically new laptop is going to be useless by the time I get to actually use it again.  And will I have to call Lenovo AGAIN to actually make a part show up?  IDK, but it's not worth the hassle, and has absolutely left me scarred from making another Lenovo purchase.\nThe sad thing is, I work in a tech field, and our company uses hundreds of Lenovo laptops.  Their on-site repair team is top notch.  Their systems (they aren't GAMING units, business/enterprise class) run amazingly well.  (And yes, their tech's confirmed to me back in like December when I was in the middle of waiting the last time, THEY have that part, there's no shortage of ANY part to them).\nThe takeaway is if you are going to buy one of these, I would definitely buy an extended warranty through lenovo.  When it worked, I loved it, but since I've owned it, it's sat apart waiting on a fan more than I've gotten to use it.  Ugh.",

It got 1 year guarantee and almost all features that Lenovo bring to us.\nIs just like the description said also the 144 Hz screen is really nice to have it.\n\nThe temps are a little bit high (90-94) on Performance Mode but with some tweaks it will go normal (80-90 (just on little spikes) is almost stucked on 80-85 on Performance Mode while on Quiet Mode it cant go over 80\u00baC even is almost stuck on 75\u00baC) and maybe with repasting it could improve a little too.\n\nThe battery  lasts around 5-7 hours on normal load (Videos, coding) and on heavy load 3-5 hours depends on the process.\n\nThe camera is down the screen so i think with a base you could use it on a easy way.\n\nI could suggest this for a first gaming laptop or just using it like a Workstation",

If you are considering purchasing a Samsung Galaxy tablet and are considering saving money by buying the 8gb instead and getting the large micro sd card, Don't Do It!!  The problem is all apps have to have a small amount of storage on your device regardless if you store the app on the sd card.  We have never had a problem running out of space with the 16gb SamSung Galaxy. We also have a third Samsung Galaxy 8gb, but we can't down load all the apps we should because of the issue I mentioned above.  I really like this Samsung Galaxy Tablet 4.  It is a really great Tablet.  The only issue you may find is that there are not many tablet cases designs to choose from due to the 8\" size. However, that does not reflect the great performance on this device.  I recommend the Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 SM-T330.",

                "review_body": "The IDEARACE Intel i5 CPU comes with a power adapter, mini WiFi antennas, a HDMI cable and some SATA cables. It has 2 USB 3.0 ports and 4 standard USB ports, 2 HDMI display ports, 6 serial ports, and a speaker / mic jack. The mini PC measures about 9\"W x 7\"D x 2\" H with mounting holes on the bottom which could be used as a rack mounted unit.\n\nThe mini PC comes with Windows 10 Pro which is nice. It booted up clean with no bloatware. After loading the mini PC with essential basic software such as Norton antivirus and Chrome browser, it still has about 210 Gb of storage available.  The Wifi connection is also quite decent with the dual antennas.\n\nJust like all the new PCs I received, I ran the PCmark benchmark on this unit right away which has a score of 1988. This about the same performance of a lower end 2018 Microsoft Surface Pro i5 laptop. Not a bad score but it is definitely not for high speed applications neither. The entire mini PC's case is made of good quality metal with heat sink type shapes all around for better heat dissipation. The unit does feel warm  but not burning hot neither when I laid my hand on the unit.\n\nOverall, this mini PC is a good candidate as a general purpose desktop replacement. With the abundant amount of serial ports, it can be easily configured to control external hardware with additional programming.  It does not come with a user manual so some good experience with PC setup would be helpful.",

                "review_body": "First thing I would have to say about this mini PC is a fairly small computer. You cannot really install any additional attachment such as a low profile graphic card or another computer processor that is a bit stronger. You can however upgrade the ram and hard drive space if needed but you need to ensure that you get the appropriate ram and hard drive.  From what I can tell, it only has one slot for a single ram (standard 8 gb). This does run on older ram which is DDR3 (little disappointing). The hard drive it uses looks like an mSata drive and not an M2 drive which makes it a bit harder to upgrade as msata is not exactly new. Regardless of this, the system runs pretty well for just a mini PC. It does come with six serial ports, four x USB 3.0, four x USB 2.0 (why not make them all 3.0?), and two audio connectors. There is also two wifi antennas on the back that will pop out and you will need to ensure those do not get bent or broken as they are hard to replace. It comes with 8 gb of DDR3 ram which can be upgraded but I am unsure up to how much. It will be at least 16 gb but I do not have anything higher than a 16 gb for single stick to test that theory. There are only two HDMI ports to use for video output so you can actually run a multi screen build with this device. I did try it out and it ran okay. It was able to do your basic tasks while also watching a 4K movie on the other screen. There is no display port or DVI port which is a bit of a bummer. That being said you will get decent video quality using the HDMI port.  Upon opening it up, I saw that there is no fan in this and it does not run too hot. It runs pretty warm even when I push the computer. I found that to be a fairly decent design. It is a whole metal design so it is able to distribute the heat well throughout the computer. You are unable to install a 3.5 or 2.5 drive into this as there is no power or data connectors in this device. Although you can use this a media center computer, it works best with network and servers as you can plug in your network devices via serial ports on the back. You can easily access this device from afar when needed. There is no internal built in speakers so I would recommend if you are using this as a desktop to get a monitor with built in speakers to keep clutter down to a minimal. The device does feel a bit sluggish with the drive it is running on. There is built in wifi for 2.4 or 5 ghz. I would say it has enough USB to support the mouse, keyboard, and several ther things (most likely printer or webcam) if you want more then you will need to get an adapter. The mini PC is not too heavy as it is passively cooled. Can it run games? You basic games like minecraft can be run on it but it is not exactly meant for heavy gaming. I did try your basic games and it actually got really warm but nothing too dangerous to the PC. I also played multiple videos on there from my TV and it worked fine. It does come with windows 10 installed already so you do not have to purchase your own copy. There is bloatware that are installed on this really slows start up and I had to get rid of those. Overall I think this is a good size for a mini PC but I do feel like it does get throttled in performance due to not wanting to over heat the system. I also feel like it should have all USB 3.0 ports at this point. If you are looking for a PC that is really quiet and for your basic every day use than this will work. Just know that it does run on some older technology and you will be unable to make any real big upgrades to it.",

But it can't handle Windows 10 and shouldn't be sold with Windows 10.\n\nI bought it for travel, for weekends at my beach place, and a backup for when speaking.  I only need it for some light word processing, responding to email if it takes too much typing for a phone, and maybe projecting powerpoint if there were a compatibility problem with the host's computer.\n\nThe lag caused by Windows 10 in only 4 GB of RAM is tolerable for such light usage.  But 29 GB of storage is too little for Windows 10.  It leaves only about 6 GB for files and is too small for Windows to download updates.\n\nSolution was simple and free. (a donation is appreciated)  Replace Windows with Linux.  I used the Mint flavor [distro] with the smallest version, xfce.  In some ways I like LibreOffice better than Microsoft Office.  Firefox is better than Edge.  As a bonus, your computer should be safer.\n\nSo I only gave four stars because I had to take the time to change the operating system.",

While we have not had it long, it is fast and working as expected.  We did purchase a two-year extended warranty. Even with the warranty, we felt we got a better laptop for less money,  We love its keyboard with the numeric pad, its fast bootup time, and its display quality.  Definitely would recommend it.",

                "review_body": "I had to buy and return three previous laptops to finally get this one and it is great. I always said I would not buy a renewed laptop because I did not want someone else's problem. But after buying three other laptops and not getting the speed, quality and ease of use that I needed, I was becoming very disillusioned with my purchases. I could not believe that I could not find a laptop on Amazon. The speed and graphics of this Newest HP 15.6inch Lightweight Laptop, Intel Quad-Core i5-1035G1 Processor Up to 3.60 GHz, 8GB DDR4 RAM, 256GB SSD + 16GB Optane, HDMI, Bluetooth are amazing and I do not mind the small ding on the frame because it delivers what you would expect from a new laptop. I think it was more the fact that this seller truly understand that they can offer a quality product and still make a profit. When I first ordered this laptop, I thought I should have gotten a bigger discount because of its \"renewed\" status, but now I think I got a great deal because of speed and quality. This laptop is a so much better than what I was expecting after the three previous \"new\" duds I purchased. Please try this seller, BuyTek if you are looking for a renewed laptop.",

The item arrived as expected, no noticeable defects of any kind. Packaging was sufficient and all the accessories were included.

You have one reviewer giving it 3 stars because he didn't get the right license-which has absolutely nothing to do with the function of the laptop and then you have the other one reviewer who has forgotten it is a 12.5 inch screen laptop-So I will add my 2 cents on actual use.\n1. First of all-It is considered an \"ultra book\" or small laptop-That is the FIRST thing you have to remember..\n2. It is has ALL the high end features you find in larger laptops (14-15.6) in a 12.5 screen.\n3. The screen is nice and crisp however the colors are a hit or miss...depending on what you are watching (seems that way even with TVs hence the various video options but remember..this is a small laptop)\n4. Touchpad....its a touchpad-unless you have Hellboy hands-its just fine for normal people.\n5. Speakers are just fine for a small room but then again-gotta slap yourself and remind yourself...its a laptop and a small one at that but it does have a speaker output for headphones.\n6. Mic-It works as well as any other laptop. Using Audacity has proved 100% success.\n7. CPU-Aww gee..I gotta remember...this is a laptop and a small one...but the i5/i7 cpus are perfect, especially with 16gb of ram and a 1tb SSD/NVME-its fast however I am not going to be making movies or anything major because if I was...I would get a bigger screened laptop..duh!\n8. KB is just fine and its lit up.\n9. Wireless-Just as good as other laptops but with 5g capability AND a sim card input for broadband on the go.\n10. Portability-Woah...now we got to the meat section. Its light...its thin and its easy to carry\n11. Battery life...woaaahh no more negative nancy here...10-12 hours on one charge..Now all that petty complaining turns out to be...pointless\n12. Applications-Runs multiple apps at one time-no sweat. Very fast wake up from sleep and reboots are seconds..\n13. The chassis-Strong and durable. made of magnesium and feels solid.\n14. The touch screen..yes...it comes with a touch screen.\n\nSo folks...these are low in price now. Which is why I waited...its well worth it if you get one now-it was worth it back then..but before you call yourself an expert...make sure you are buying it for what you need.",

It happens with all brands of laptops and he should have returned it on day one instead of keeping it and posting a one star review.  Also he demands that no one should buy it.

I shopped all weekend and settled on buying a new Unit from a Big Box Store, but come Monday the sale was over and the price went up $250.. Doh!\n\nThere are loads of Refurbished Laptops for sale everywhere and I was skeptical for sure. But the price was right and I took a chance. My Unit was advertised as in Excellent Condition and it was... Not a scratch on it.\nThe only thing that gives it away as a used piece are the slight witness marks on the Palm Rests where you lay you hands. So it must have been used in a business application by someone that typed a lot but took good care of it.\n\nThe Processor and Ram specs are great and rated as Battleship on PC UserBenchmark! The new Unit I was looking at was not this powerful and more expensive even on sale. This Unit is 3 years old at most going by the Processor manufacturer date. I have 4 Desktops in service and this Laptop is faster than all of them, LOL! The onboard Video Card is fine for HD Video but not intended demanding Games which is fine because that's not what I bought it for..\n\nI've used it 2 days at work now and the Battery lasted all day where I was recharging my old Dual Core Unit by mid day.. I took the opportunity to do the free upgraded to Windows 11 and it's nice so far. This Unit was $1200 new so $400 was a GREAT DEAL! The 90 day return is good piece of mind.",

I thought it was because it was not fully charged. I went a head and set it up. I then turned it off and fully charged it. I started to use it again and if I stopped for any reason it would go black and I would have to hit the power button to get the screen again. I tired to work with it and just gave up. This morning (Tuesday) I went on line to chat with the Samsung Support. I installed the program that allowed the tech to access my tablet.\nHe checked it out and recommend I set it back to factory re stall. I did and then I could not even work to set it up again as it kept going black.\nThe Samsung tech said it was most likely a factory defect and I could take it to a Samsung repair shop to have it fixed for free. That is not acceptable for me to have to repair a brand new tablet. So I am sending it back. I am not sure if I will purchase another Samsung Tablet A\nor go with another brand. I will have to think about it for a while. I liked the size and look of the tablet, it just would not stay on long enough for me to use it.",

This one works perfectly!  plenty big enough for the square app, fast speed, no wi fi issues.  Just great overall.  Only small issue is it doesn't seem to like having more than one bluetooth device connected.  It can do it, but it gets finicky and may drop one device over another.  Irritating since we have to have one of our square readers connected via bluetooth but also want to stream music in the shop on bluetooth speakers.  I'm sure there's a workaround.",

Check these out on the Web I think you will agree with me. I researched this thoroughly.\nI would recommend this tablet to anyone I know.  Get one (a new one) before they sell out..!!",

The battery life is good as I've only charged it once in the two days that I've owned it.  The speed at which it operates is good too with the Android 6.0 OS.  App speed and app download speeds from Google play are good too.  The size of the tablet is perfect for viewing movies and videos with decent resolution.  I added a micro-SD card for increased storage capacity.  But because of the tablet's slim size, I found that having a decent case allowed me to hold it better.  Overall, it was a good buy at that price.",

I bought it mainly to watch movies from my massive PLEX servers which stream high data rates but yet the tablet rarely connects to the servers.  The tablet shuts down without any input within 10 seconds from last command.  Still having trouble with Facebook, YouTube and e-mail so I'm not sure if this is user error or just a bad tablet.  I'm having my nephew go over it to make sure it is the tablet and not me (I've been around since the telegraph was high-tech, lol) just in case I need to return it.  I was able to find a PDF file with the entire operators manual for it but at 110 pages it seems like a lot of reading to just use some simple aps and commands.  I'll update in the near future to let people interested know the outcome.",

In general I still think Android is the problem, it still feels like a cheap imitation to IOS, I don't like the behavior of the home screen or how I have to select apps, I don't like having to root the device to get rid of Chrome which I neither need or want and considering the space used by native pre-installed apps I was hoping that I'd have more control with Android. I originally bought the device to read magazines, and this it does very well using Google News stand app. Would I recommend this device, no save you money and get an iPad like I will end up doing or just get a cheap Android tablet, Android isn't worth spending a lot of money on. I was really hopeful that I'd love this device, I'd seen it in person and I'd liked the hardware, but I see I will just sell it and by an iPad.",

And where ever the screen is touched, some function turns on or off.  Trying to read a book on it is almost impossible unless you are comatose and can't move or breathe. You find your place and when you touch the device to set it down somewhere, it suddenly magnifies/decreases the page, turns on or off, goes ahead/behind to another chapter/page. Pick it up to correct it and it slips through your fingers like a wet fish.  After you have climbed out of bed to catch it again and find your place, and maybe even set the timer, then you have to place the weanie speakers right up to your ears because if you are the kind of person who likes to breathe, you won't be able to hear it because the volume is on the back of the unitand is very very weak.  So you can't see what you're doing plus HEAR anything at the same time.  Forget about listening to this thing in the car on the way to your knitting class.  Also, every time you turn on the wi fi to say, download a book, prepare to wait about 15 minutes and to lose about 98% of your battery before you can actually use it again.  When all updates are finally finished you only have 2% battery and have to recharge before listening to your audio book or checking your email. In the middle of doing anything it freezes up because suddenly you have 17 mysterious gigabytes trying to run at one time.  It is nothing at all like the more substantial Tab 2.  Its a fail :(",

I was shocked as to why it would not turned on after I had already gave it a fully charged. I thought it is a defected device; I connect the power charger on and the battery life level is at a zero power.

The apps are smooth with little lag. The rear camera is mediocre at 5 mp. Low light shots are abyssmal.  This is a tablet and not a digital camera but many people take pictures at family events/gatherings. Samsung really cut corners here and must do better with that. Battery life is very good surprisingly. All around it is very good for daily use and streaming movies.  There aren't many decent tablets being made from any manufacturer.  This one is a good value for the money.",

I didn't want to break the bank and wanted something smaller, more book sized for reading and travel. For the prove this tablet has been great.  Good screen,  good battery life,  great form factor. The only thing I wasn't keen on was the built in memory and Touch Wiz.  The default amount of built in memory should be 32GB.  Touch Wiz puts a lot of crap between you and the OS, but it's not horrible and at least it's stable. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a good tab at a good price.",

More inviting than a full-size laptop and easy to use anywhere (the car, the kitchen table, etc.), which makes it easier to get past writers block  (I can use my smartphone as a Wi-Fi hotspot for internet connectivity if need be). The 8\" is just the right size for me--screen is big enough to read web pages comfortably but still very portable . No complaints about the screen resolution (I don't watch video on it or play games).  Bluetooth connectivity works well (occasional, rare, connection blips).  Long-lasting charge.  Got helpful free phone support from Samsung. [Note:  The advertised free Word and other MS Office applications are extremely limited--not worth downloading.]",

After reading those reviews and finding the resolution is similar between sizes, I chose the 8 inch for cost efficiency. It's the right size for on-the-go and the resolution is beautiful. I was able to get this tablet, a one year warranty and a case and screen protectors well under the cost of the 9.7 inch tablet. I am extremely happy with my purchase (no buyers remorse) and if you want a fun take with you tablet, this Samsung galaxy A is an excellent choice.

I also didn't like that it was all Amazon-specific and did not include the Google Play store.\n\nI decided to order this one instead (basically the same price as the 32GB no-special-offers Kindle) and I am so glad I did. This is a beautiful tablet, with great bright screen, powerful speakers and good battery life. It runs games, Skype video conferences, and everything else we tried without a problem. It does not feel at all like a budget device. The only disadvantage compared with the same-price Kindle is that it has less memory (16GB) , but it does take microSD cards, so I am not concerned about that.\n\nWe paired it with the BMOUO Samsung Galaxy Tab A 8.0 Kids Case, which is also excellent.",

It has proven to be extremely reliable, and as a college student, i recommend it because it comes with MS office built in, which comes in handy as a student. I've used this device to write essays, assemble power point presentations, and even used one note as scratch paper while doing algebra.  Its small, but not too small. Its powerful and reliable.  Its not as beefy as some of the other galaxy tabs, but you really get a good machine in a small package. It can even run pokemon go (if you have a phone with wifi hotspot with you as well). This device has given me an edge as a student due to its capabilities in relation to its size. It does everything a tablet should do.

I had to send it in for repair (on Dec 3) and still do not have it back (now Dec 26).  The repair was completed on 12/7.  We think it is lost in the repair facility because UPS has never received it.  Communication with Samsung Customer Service is not good.  They answer the phones and try to help but getting transferred to a supervisor who can actually do something is next to impossible.  My wife achieved this today after being on the phone for a total of over 2 hours and having been disconnected 3 times.  The 3rd customer service representative actually called her back and eventually transferred her to a supervisor.  We are supposed to hear something by the 28th the latest.

My phone is about 6 inches right now and an inch more screen space wouldn't justify a new device purchase.\n\nThe next thing I wanted was a micro SD card slot...pretty obvious as to why. For reading I wanted a 4X3 aspect ratio, this is important because a lot of tablets are made to watch movies and such in 16X9 or 16X10. When put in portrait mode 4X3 gives you a wider screen to view text. I'm going to post photos to show how different reading types fit on the screen.\n\n Finally I wanted something that will last a while - especially since I love to read for hours on end.

The camera (I know, tablet cameras usually aren't super) is terrible imho and I'm talking about the back camera.  Also do not like where the back camera is.  It's just not serving the purpose I bought it for at all.  Very disappointed with Samsung and this tablet.

The Paperwhite screen was only 6\", which was too small for me. So, the Kindle vs Tab A. I finally decided that I didn't want to lock myself into the Amazon ecosystem, so I chose the Tab A.\n\nSo far, I'm loving it. Perfect size for reading (about the size of a hardback book, definitely bigger than a paperback). I downloaded the Netflix app. Yes, I prefer a bigger screen, but it's perfect for an occasional flight in a cramped seat. My MP3 files sound great, and all of my reading apps run flawlessly. The only wart is that the Tab A 8.0 only has one speaker, so the only way to get stereo sound is via external speakers or ear buds. No biggie, since I bought this for its portability.\n\nAll in all  I couldn't be happier.",

The design is sleek, thin, and the smoky titanium is aesthetically pleasing. I know I can take this with me anywhere, and the battery life is solid. So far I've been able to get two days of use on a single charge.\n\nPerformance wise, this tablet is very fast and responsive. It's basically a bigger version of my galaxy phone, which I love. The storage space is a little small, but thankfully there's an sd slot to make up for that. The only weird thing I've run into is it had me go through 3 or 4 software updates when I first got it, so it could upgrade to the latest version of android. For me this wasn't a problem, just a little annoying to deal with upon first using it. For the price this is a very high quality product, and I would recommend it to anyone!\n\nPros: lightweight, beautiful display, very responsive touchscreen, good battery life, google apps, sleek look, fast performance\nCons: small storage space of only 16gb",

So far, I've installed all his favorite apps (even ones he ran out of room for on his old tablet), and I've got room for more. I added a 64GB microSD card, and told Google Play to load all movies on the card (AWESOME!!!! Saves soooo much space). I've also got VUDU installed doing the same... in total, I've added about 10 HD movies to his tablet all without taking up space from the precious 16GB RAM. [if you're wondering, the movies from Google Play are mainly Disney Movies Anywhere digital copies, and VUDU has the remaining UltraViolet digital copies).  All of them look fantastic on his tab (really, the relatively low screen resolution is NOT a problem whatsoever, for him and for most adults). He's not going to be looking and working with tiny fonts where he'll notice the tiny jaggies.\nNow I just need a bit more time to see how its performance holds up with his games and general usage, and how sturdy it is in his case.",

I seldom watch videos on a tablet so that was also a factor in selecting the 4:3 format and the lower resolution of the Tab A vs the higher end Samsung tablets. The touch screen has a nice feel and is very responsive. I also like the magnetic sensor that places the tablet in sleep mode when using a case that has this feature. I have used 7 inch tablets and find them too small. Trying 10 inch tablets in stores I have found them to be a bit cumbersome and heavy for casual use and travel. The 8 inch size of this tablet is perfect for our use. It is near us at all times for quick Web browsing and reading email. The tablet comes with Microsoft Office, but I rarely use it on the tablet. I find that these programs are much better on a desktop or laptop computer. All in all this tablet is perfect for our needs and I would recommend it anybody looking for a tablet they are using it for casual browsing and reading email.",

The cameras also are passable.\n\nOk. Once I accepted those \"cons\" it performs fine under my standards. The UI is virtually identical to the high dollar units. It has ran without issue any Play Store app I've tried. I'm not a mobile gamer so I'm not sure on that. The device quality as far as material is good. Feels the same as the flagship. Looks clean and elegant. Has the micro SD slot! I don't feel left behind by the higher devices. This device suits my needs. I watch Netflix, YT, and any vid I try. Use Google calendar, message apps, social media, pay bills etc... My eyes adjusted to the screen so I don't notice the flaws and it's plenty bright. Bottom line: I saved $200+ and sacrificed very little. Im off the \"flagship\" bandwagon. Keeping up with the Joneses isn't worth it.",

If you tend to armor your electronics as I do you might want to shop around for something just a bit larger, but that's the Basics case, not the Tablet. Android 5 autocorrect is very aggressive and not very smart, so be careful if you're in email or on Spacebook before you've finished a cup of coffee. I had returned a Kit Kat tablet because I need to space on my external SD. Win. I actually travelled to Europe with a tablet and Bluetooth keyboard for a month's study, and so far this one is holding up very well as my portable word processor as well. Last, watched a movie with my girlfriend using the keyboard stand (before the Rhino case came). Very sharp picture without viewing angle issues, and exceptional sound, and less than 30% battery depletion for a two hour film on Netflix. I haven't watched anything since putting it in the Rhino, and I hope that doesn't disrupt the excellence of the volume and clarity of the sound. Overall, if you need or want a smaller tablet, are generally happy with the Samsung brand (as I am), this is the tablet for you.",

                "review_body": "It's OK runs well so far, it's still new so time will tell as these products seem to deteriorate over time. It is somewhat fast thus far and handles all apps pretty well. One issue I am running to a lot is Apps in the google store give me the error 'may not be optimized for this device\" about 80% of the time. Seems rather odd. Supposed to be with Android 5 but was delivered with Android 6. Upon starting is immediately began an update and now it is running Android 7.1.1. Perhaps that might be the issue with the apps. it also is confused about the \"home page\" because ALL apps I install say it is \"adding short cut to the home page\" but actually it is adding it to the page just to the right of the home page, and YES, I know where my home page is. Screen is very clear and it reads books really well with ZERO pixelation. I am finding it is much easier to use it in landscape mode but I am constantly clicking back button and multiple page button over and over again. It's also very easy the click the apps on the bottom row by accident as well......I am for ever opening up the camera by accident. I hate the position of the rear camera...when in landscape and trying to take a picture my fingers always get in the way of the lense due to its poor placement. Si I have to hold it by the very edge so as not to block the lense and that makes it a bit difficult to hold it steady and secure. Pictures are OK for the price I paid but the camera does not do well in poor or low lighting. I also am finding that the touch screen is somewhat sporadic. Some times while online it takes multiple taps in order for it to register. I don't know how many camera shots I have lost due to the fact that it wasn't registering my taps on the button. My biggest downer about this thus far is the speaker placement. In portrait it is on the bottom left and in landscape it is on the bottom right, right where my hand is. Super poor placement IMO. Overall, for the price I paid for it I am somewhat happy but I just have to get used to the things I don't like about it.",

This one blows them right out of the water. The battery life is amazing. I fully charged the device when I got it and ran it through some tests. Streaming video from Netflix for 8 consecutive hours took the battery from 100% to 72% Side by side with my 4th generation iPad doing the same test the battery on the iPad drained to 15%. Yes, I'm sure the battery being new has something to do with it. but impressive nonetheless.\n\nI setup the kids mode and allow my 4 year old son to play with it. He loves it and the kids mode allows him to play without any worry of accidental purchases, or getting into something he shouldn't.\n\nAlso the added free software they include is quite nice. The full MS Office suite comes pre-loaded which is surprisingly nice to have. I deal with a lot of Spreadsheets for work and it has allowed me to keep my laptop in my bag and handle things from the tablet.\n\nI expanded the memory with a 128 GB micro SD. For the same amount of storage with the iPad it would cost more then buying 3 of these.\n\nAll that being said, The screen is not as sharp as I would like. But if that's not a big deal to you this thing is a winner.\n\nI feel confident in making a recommendation for this product, and plan on buying one for my parents and siblings this Christmas.",

We originally bought a kids Amazon fire and that was a huge disappointment. I didn't want to pay the amount of money they asked for an iPad so I asked multiple people and did tons of research and everything pointed to this tablet!\n\nIt took me a little while to figure out since I have never owned any Samsung products, but I'm talking 10 minutes at most. It's still set up very similarly to Apple products.\n\nThis tablet runs great, super fast, which was the main problem with the fire. This one also offers everything I was looking for.\nMost parents want the \"kids time\" stuff with apps for their kids, which I believe there is an app for that on here, but I didn't. I wanted to download netflix, kids YouTube, learning apps, Disney jr, etc. That way my son could choose between what he wanted to do easily. The apps that came on here like chrome and mail and such I just moved 4 pages over and he has no idea they are there! I have my apps over there also ;)\nThe other great thing about this tablet is the battery life! It doesn't take long to charge and the battery actually lasts!\n\nI'm extremely impressed with this tablet, it is definitely worth the money!\nI 100% recommend this for a child or adult!",

There is much to be liked about it, but the one thing I find both frustrating and annoying is that in writing e-mails, it anticipates the words being typed and as often as not gets them wrong, but types them anyhow, necessitating constant retyping and attentive re-reading of one's messages before clicking \"send.\"  I would have preferred spell-check to this anticipatory feature, which rather than speeding up the composition of a message, actually slows it down considerably.  I've not yet experimented with the tablet's many capabilities and features, including the camera, which I have been told is excellent.  I also have not added any apps.  So this review must be considered somewhat premature and a work-in-progress.",

                "review_body": "I just purchased this tablet, and I am in love!!! I did a lot of research on tablets, and I was looking for one that had the ability to transfer apps to the SD card. There were many that said they could, but when I did further research, they actually could not, so don\u2019t be fooled. The screen size on this tablet was 8\u201d, and I am used to using a 7\u201d screen, but I am now a HUGE fan of the 8\u201d screen this one has. The processer was 1.5 GB ram, and it runs so fast and smooth. I got a 16 GB and added a 16 GB SD card, and I have tons of room. We also have a nexus 7 tablet, and I was looking for something comparable to that, and this one did, and exceeded my expectations. The nexus 7 does not allow an SD card, so this is an upgrade from that tablet for sure.  Also, I am huge into the online game apps, and I have installed 13 of my game apps on it, in addition to many other apps within the first week, with no problems at all. I have so much room on it, it is amazing. I have read many reviews that say the screen quality on this particular tablet was not good, and I have found that to be false in my opinion. This tablet came with the home charger, which was something some other tablets I reviewed did not all come with. I would recommend this tablet to anyone looking for a fast, high capacity tablet that is not so expensive that you have to mortgage your house to own one.",

Time to charge was about as user manual explains - 4 hours to charge if fully discharged.  So, it took about 1 hour 35 minutes.  Easy to set up - not too many screens to go through and not difficult to figure out how to provide input to go on to next screens.  User manual misled me by its description of Microsoft Word being preloaded on the tablet.  After copying a Word document from a computer to this tablet, the document could not be opened - interface sought a network connection.  I thought that I would be able to at least view a Word document without a network connection.  Samsung customer service person informed me that at least for first use, tablet software will seek updates to Word, and therefore a network connection is needed.  After initial updates, I was informed that I should be able to work with Word documents without a network connection.  Found out 1/1/2018 that Ethernet network option is not available despite the user manual describing that it is.  Samsung customer service informed me that the Galaxy Tab A is not designed to work on an Ethernet network no matter what adapter is tried.  Internet search, that included discussions among tablet users did not find any assurances of tablet use with any Ethernet adapters.,",

                "review_body": "About a year ago I bought a Samsung Galaxy 7 tablet for my son as a Christmas gift, but never had a lot of interest in buying one for myself, seeing I owned a Kindle Fire.  Even though he is disabled, my son loves his tablet and takes it most everywhere with him.  I have a Samsung Galaxy 5 cell phone, but it is a work phone and I am not allowed to load apps or anything to it.  Love the phone but not being able to do anything non-work related with it is frustrating.  So between my son's tablet and my phone, I have always been impressed with Samsung mobile type products.  A friend has a Samsung tablet and suggested I might find it easier to use and more beneficial than my Kindle.  I had always found the Kindle to be difficult to use except as a reader and for audible books and I have had it for several years now.  So I figured I would give a tablet a try and this Samsung seemed to fit the bill.  I am very impressed with it and now do everything I use to do with the Kindle plus a lot more.  Accessing email, using apps, shopping on Amazon, plus syncing it with my Kindle and Audible books, is a lot better than my Kindle.  So the Kindle will gather dust or I will give it to a friend.  BTW - I don't get the cheap looking comments on this tablet.  Not so in my opinion and I have a nice case for it, so not sure what folks are referring to in that regard.  Very nice tablet for this first time tablet owner.",

I was looking for a lightweight, fast, and reliable Android table for under $300. This one definitely exceeds my expectations (and at a great price). My husband has a new ipad (not air) that I think its too bulky. Also, I don't love iOS and am not a fan of itunes.  So Apple was out for me.  I was worried Samsung would add too many layers on top of the pure Android experience, but Lollipop (it upgraded already!) seems to have minimal overt Samsung modifications (at least none that bother me).\n\nI am not a heavy video consumer but the few videos I did watch (you tube) looked great to me.\nStrongly recommend this table at this price point!\n\nUpdate:\nI've had it for a few days and still love a lot about it.  What I don't love: even though I don't watch a lot of video content, the resolution difference between this tablet and my phone is enormous.  I didn't think it would matter to me -- but it does.  I like reading websites on my phone better, which defeats one of the purposes of this tablet. Also, the touch screen isn't always as responsive as I'm used to.  I haven't seen anyone else mention this in the Tab A, so maybe it is just this device. I also get a lag sometimes that I never get on my Moto X (phone).  I'm leaning toward returning it right now even though I still think it is a great tablet otherwise.  Changed from 5 to 4 stars.",

                "review_body": "Got this tablet as a Christmas gift.  Have had iPads & phones for a number of years so hard to rate an android like I do apple.  I do like the tablet and can do pretty much what our apples do.  The main thing I may be unhappy with is not being able to move some of the apps to the SD card.  I don't go app crazy so I only have a few apps but I'm disappointed that some won't move to the external SD card and it seems like the 16 GB memory is filling up fast.  Haven't checked user guide to see if there are more options to free up space once the internal storage is full but could be I can uninstall a lot of pre-loaded apps that I won't use. Galaxy has a great reputation and I do like the chance to learn about android since my wife has an android tablet.  Because it's not like iOS it takes a while to accomplish what we want but so far have muddled my way through things.  I have also heard because android is a user based OS that it is easier to hack. Also read that sometimes moving apps or some things from 1 android OS to another may not work.  The tablet seems to run slower than apples and at times it seems like it locks up.  I'm  sure if you're an android fan the tablet would rate 5 stars.  I gave it 4 because the cost of the android is more reasonable than apple.  Hope this is helpful.",

The larger sized screen on this one (8 as opposed to my old one being 7) makes typing a lot easier. The screen is also very crisp and clear and I have no problem with the resolution as other reviewers complained about.\n\nPros:\nBeautiful, clear screen\n\nThe colors on everything are nice\n\nApps load and run quickly and play perfectly\n\nThe speeds of things (for the most part, see my 'cons' list) are really fast\n\nThe split screen feature seems nice, but I only used it once and I don't need it really\n\nThe tablet itself is pretty lightweight and comfortable\n\nThe rear camera is REALLY nice, the auto-focus is great, and it takes very clear nice photos in the daytime. Nighttime photos varies depending on the amount of lighting\n\nCons:\nBrowser & Youtube speeds - I find that Chrome crawls and loads pages slowly, even mobile versions. Often I wait quite a long time for something to load on a page, or the youtube app will show the spinning wheel for quite some time. I didn't have this issue with the older Tab 3 with browsing, but I did with Youtube so perhaps it's an issue with Youtube's app? Either way, browser speeds were sluggish.\n\nFingerprints show up BIG TIME on the glass. The first time I used it and put it down I could see every detail of where my fingers had been.\n\nThe front facing camera is awful in every lighting. I found myself trying to awkwardly take pictures with the back camera instead of the front because the front one is just bad. I'm also really not feeling the facial beauty thing it does on self photos and I haven't found a way to turn it off yet. It also doesn't appear to have the auto focus the rear camera does.",

                "review_body": "I have been an Apple iPad purist for years. When I recently gave my mother my iPad Mini (she is having some issues with her vision and it's easier for her to use for certain apps than her phone), I thought I'd be content with just having my Pro 9.7. However, I like to read in bed, and the larger iPad really doesn't work well for that. I considered a Kindle Paperwhite, but since the Paperwhite doesn't reverse to a black field with white text I didn't want to use that and needed something for which I could use the Kindle app.\n\nI decided to try an Android tablet, which would be significantly less expensive than a new Mini 4. Plus, I'd been wanting to get experience with Android because I have friends who have Android phones who are always asking me questions about them for which I have no answer. After doing a bit of research, I decided on the Galaxy Tab A 8-inch, which was almost exactly the same size as the Mini. Several local stores had good sales but nobody ... and I mean NOBODY ... had one in stock. They had plenty of the 7\" tablets but with the smaller size and only 8GB of memory, even with the SD expansion slot, I wasn't interested. So I ordered it here.\n\nI am very pleased with this device. It was easy to set up and it's been responsive and intuitive to use. The size and form factor are nearly identical to my old Mini. If anything I like the Kindle app better on the Android than on the iPad -- not the least of which is because you can buy Kindle books directly from the Android app and not from the Apple one (has to do with Apple demanding 30% of all sales on the iPad, which includes Kindle books. Can't say I blame Amazon for not wanting part of that \"deal\").\n\nI only have one minor complaint and not a large enough one to warrant a loss of a star -- you can't turn down the ambient light on the Galaxy as far as you can with the Mini. This only becomes an issue because I tend to stay up later than my husband so when I am reading he is trying to sleep, and it seems like I can't get the screen as dark as my Mini could go. Curiously, he says the ambient light it throws seems to be less overall and it doesn't bother him at all. Maybe it projects less overall but it seems brighter to me.",

I have purchased other products from them, was really happy at the \"deals\" I got, and got them covered with an extended warranty through Square Trade. It occurred to me I hadn't covered this tablet and tried to do so. After jumping through a ton of hoops, I was informed Amazon changed its policy and no longer offers Square Trade warranties for Amazon Warehouse. The other two warranty suggestions I received got so many horrible reviews from users, I wondered why these were even available at Amazon.\n\nTo add insult to injury, I purchased a lovely case to protect this beautiful tablet, set it down on the window sill and it slipped off and cracked ... in the case! Ugh! Thank goodness I bought it with my American Express card, which protects purchases (including drops) in the first 90days. That said, please keep in mind that Amazon will NOT help you with quality warranties on Warehouse merchandise AND, not for nothing, but I'm a little unhappy that the tablet is so \"fragile\" (?) that the screen cracks so easily, and very unhappy that the cover offered such little protection. I am very careful with my things & often have them for YEARS, so I am a bit disappointed in the fragility of this product.\n\nOriginal review: I am very happy with the Samsung tablet. I have watched more than  a few on demand videos now and don't understand the criticism of picture/screen quality - it's beautiful. I have the 8\" Tab A and couldn't be happier with my decision. I charged it fully when I got it on Sunday (!); today is Friday and I am only now charging it again. Mind you, the battery was at about 46%. Incredibly decent. And during that time, I watched about 3 hours of video content, checked email daily and left WiFi on. My cover puts the tablet to sleep when closed and wakes it up when opened, so it has not been shut down in six days. I have access to all the apps I could need and LOVE that it comes loaded with Microsoft Office - giving me access to Word, Excel  and Power Point.  I don't know how well the camera and video work yet but will update if something is amis. I had this on my Wish list and kept an eye for a deal. I spotted one in the Amazon Warehouse, listed in very good condition for $151.00 vs. $195.00. I would say it is BRAND new and cannot imagine email you could see a difference! Outstanding.

                "review_body": "First, many thanks to Amazon! Outstanding service, as always!\nSamsung Galaxy Tab A 8\" Tablet. I purchased it because my 4\" Galaxy Player has a very old version of Android: 2.3.5. Therefore some of my beloved applications start disappearing because their creators upgraded them for a higher Android version. So sad. My little player was and still is the best hardware there is with all the bells and whistles that many of the new tablets can't match today.\nSo, my experience with Samsung's tablet:\n8\" is too big for my little hands. Holding it to read a book or the news with one hand is a pain. Try both hands, and you'll find your fingers on the screen, which, normally will make the tablet to respond to some commands and switch the screens, open up other apps...and so forth. And I have the continuous sensation that the tablet wants to slip an fall all the time.\nAnother annoying feature is the screen brightness. Yes, I did try to set it up from Auto On/Off. In the dark, at night, it darkens. In the daylight, brightens. Very strange way of acting and totally stubborn despite the settings. Missing a + and - for manually adjusting it. (Because in the top front of screen there is a sensor that watches you and adjust the brightness of the screen based on if thinks you are looking at it or not? how maddening is that? The tablet knows better what you need? How hard is to push a + or a -  /setting ????\nThe most annoying issue is on how the Marshmallow, 6.0 is distorting the resolution on some applications. Didn't they learned that when upgrading to a new OS version, the video capacity of the computers(tablets) is to be considered?\nAll my beloved puzzle games are not plastered on an 8\" screen, they look like a tank rolled over them, if you ever booted your Windows OS in Safe Mode, you know what I see here.\nThe tablet came with the Lollypop, but once you unpack it, set it up and connect it online, it automatically updates, upgrades and so on.\nSo, in 5 minutes from connecting I had the Marshmallow, 6.01. (btw, fabulous fast connectivity and speed from my unlocked T-Mobile WiFi hotspot device).\nI am sick and tired being used by Microsoft over the years of being an unpaid - but - paying tester of their OS. It seems that Google is now doing the same.\nHowever, looking at it, the tablet is very attractive, and I won't contest most buyers here are satisfied. And congratulations to all! Overall, it is a good buy. Samsung and Amazon are both in my heart.\nBut based on my personal inability to handle the device (hands too small) I have to return it, and I am really sorry.\nIf anyone returns it, please don't forget: Delete the Google account you created in the tablet (not your gmail account!), then reset it to the factory settings before returning it. Because that's the nice thing to do.",

I don't care about or can download myself if I want to: Skype, Netflix, Word, Excel, PowerPoint and some more. Why is it most manufacturers believe this will help? I would be better to let the owner decide. 2) Anothe other reason I took a star away is Lollipop 5.02... Really..? On 2016...? Lollipop (Android 5 was released on 2014). Yes, I know Samsung promised Lollipop for the Tab A... but when...? 2018..? This is now a ONE YEAR OLD tablet, that came with an ALREADY OLD ANDROID VERSION and STILL HAS NO UPDATE TO MARSHMALLOW, so I've stopped dreaming about \"N\". Next tablet will be a Nexus. No doubt about it!\n\nFelt good to let that out of my system. Now, on the good side, the 4:3 format is just great, and the 8 inches is like the perfect size. I come from a Tab 2 7.0 oldie and I prefer tablets I can hold on one hand. For the record: I use the tablet for study during the day and some reading on the bed.\n\nFinally, the original Samsung clamp is also great. It holds to the Tab A with a special lock the Tab has, and looks nice! It has a reasonbale price.",

                "review_body": "Works great! for about a 100$ it does what I needed it to and is the perfect size to fit in my purse. So far Ive owned 3/4 different tablets: a small \"phablet\", this one (8\"), a 10\" nexus, and the surface pro 4. Of the 4 tablets, I like this size the best.  The phablet I found was too big and awkward to comfortably fit in my pockets, but small enough that reading books or watching tv was a bit uncomfortable on the eyes.  By contrast the 10\" nexus and surface pro 4 (which I use for work primarily) are to large to fit in my mid size purses.  This size can fit in nearly every one of my bags ( the only exception being my small clutches and evening bags).\n\n It works quickly, and I havent had any issues with it overheating. It is a bit of a slow charger, and if your are using the tablet with the screen on full brightness, it will drain the battery faster then it will charge. I did find however, that so long as you have the brightness set to the lowest level, it will (slowly) charge at a rate of about 1% increase per 10 minutes.  In normal conditions, if I am not charging and using simultaneously, it takes a couple hours to fully charge.\n\nThe blue smoke color is beautiful.  I bought a cheap (like 6$) case for my tablet to protect since it does get tossed about in my purse.",

Skipping to the punch line, the 7.0 went back to Amazon the next day and I got the Tab A 8.0 the day after that. My wife loves it. Resolution? Pixels? Processor? Android Version? My wife couldn't care less. The 4:3 display is bright and colorful & the tablet is fast.\n\nWould I have bought it for myself? No. I bought the 8.0 Tab S2 6 months ago because I buy the best electronics products I can afford regardless of the price/performance ratios. This is no knock on the S2...I would make the same decision again today. The 320 ppi AMOLED display is gorgeous and it is fast...but really no faster than the A 8.0 for the way my wife uses her tablet. Why? The S2 needs the Quad Core processors and the higher performance GPU to push everything out on to that beautiful screen. The processor on the Tab A has a lot less work to do and it does it remarkably well...especially for a $169 tablet. Can I tell the difference when I put this tablet and my S2 side by side? You bet...but in this case that was quite beside the point.\n\nSo consider the user's needs and/or check the tablet out yourself before dismissing it because of the specs.",

I love playing the game WORDS WITH FRIENDS.  I was playing through my computer, through FACEBOOK.  The game moved so slowly, pop-up commercials were a constant, the board would freeze, and all of this would cut into my game production time.  Plus, it was very frustrating to sit and wait while a letter slowly went from the bottom of the board to where I wanted to place it!  And, really, I have ZERO patience!\n\nMy husband got me this SAMSUNG tablet and I could not be happier with it.  I am able to be on FACEBOOK, play WORDS WITH FRIENDS, check my email, play other games, plus there are many other features that I have yet to dive into.  The tablet fits nicely in my hands.  It also comes with a stylus. There is also a charger included  The tablet charges quickly and holds the charge for my entire day.  We purchased a screen protector and cover separately for my tablet.  It is sleek and cool and wonderful.\n\nI am a technology challenged person, but seem to be able to muddle through this tablet and its many functions nicely.

                "review_body": "I own both the models of Galaxy Tab A 9.7 and 8.0  in our household and the Tab A 8.0 is the one I use personally all them time mainly because of its compact size which is great for one handed use and a sharper screen . I purchased the Tab A 8.0 after deliberating considerably whether to go for the Tab A 8.0 or the newer Tab E . In the end I choose the Tab A because if felt much more premium in hands compared to the Tab E.  Here's how I feel these both the Tab A 9.7 & 8.0  tablets stack up against each other if you're considering either of the two :\n\nBUILD QUALITY\n- Both the  tablets are made of plastic with a metallic frame that runs around its sides. Despite its plastic construction these tablets do not feel cheap in any way ( The newer Tab E in comparison feels cheaper) with its soft touch matte finish plastic\n- The color choices on the tablet is great , having owned both the White & 'Smoky Titanium' colors - you cant go wrong with either of them . The white color is a nice soft metallic white with a slight pearl effect and the 'Smoky Titanium' is more of a metallic gunmetal shade - a good departure of the standard solid whites ,greys or blacks found on most other tablets\n\nFEATURES & PERFORMANCE\n- Both the Tab A 8.0 & 9.7 feature the same Qualcomm SnapDragon 410 processor - A mid range quad core 64 Bit 1.2 Ghz processor released in 2014\n- Both the 8.0\" and 9.7\" scored pretty similarly on the AnTuTu synthetic benchmark owing to their similar hardware specifications (see pics)\n- Both 9.7\" and 8.0\" tablets feature screens with 768 X 1024 resolution which gives them a pixel density ( higher values mean sharper images & text) of 160 PPI for the 8.0\" model and 132 PPI on the 9.7\" model\n- The 160 PPI pixel density on the 8.0\" is adequate for most uses , including browsing text heavy websites like Wikipedia , without having to zoom in too much. The pixelation is much more noticeable on the 9.7\" model\n- The screen colors are rich and vibrant with good viewing angles\n- The 8.0\" tab features a 4200 mAh battery which is good for 1.5 days of heavy use , the only issue here is it charges rather slowly at max of 1A as compared to the max charging current of 2A on the 9.\" model\n- In terms of performance , it can easily handle about 3 simultaneous tabs in the chrome browser after which the limitations & slowdowns due to its 1.5GB RAM become apparent (Both models have 1.5GB RAM)\n- The single speaker at the bottom of the 8.0\" model is pretty weak and you would usually have to turn up the volume above 75% to hear anything clearly (as opposed to better dual stereo speakers on the 9.7\" model)\n- The tablet does have an expandable MircoSD card slot which is great\n\nTHE GOOD\n- The 8.0 model has a rich and vibrant screen with good viewing angles and sufficient resolution for everyday use\n- Touchscreen sensitivity and fluidity is great with not stuttery UI performance\n- The 8.0 screen size is ideal for one handed use , yet offer enough real estate for media consumption like pictures or videos.\n- The tablet performance is more than adequate, I had no issues running 1080P movies on the Netflix app , browsing with 3-4 tabs open or playing light games like Temple Run, Subway Surfer etc\n- I absolutely love Samsung's implementation of  multi-tasking which allows you to run two compatible apps side by side in windowed form . This is one feature , which once you get used to, you will be using very often\n- Expandable storage\n- Its upgraded to the latest Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow OS\n\nTHE NOT SO GOOD\n- Weak single speaker\n- the 5MP rear and 2MP front camera's are not that great, though they are sufficient for video chatting\n- Average battery life of 1.5 days and very slow charging speeds at 1A\n- For these reasons I take away one star\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\nOverall I really like the Tab A 8.0 (over our Tab A 9.7) and can highly recommend it to you as you get a great form factor , decent screen resolution and performance with bright vivid colors and expandable storage all for under a $150 price tag. In fact i still choose this tablet over heavily discounted Ipad Mini during Black Friday 2016 as I felt it fulfilled my requirements sufficiently and gave more bang for my buck",

I am a college student as well as an entrepreneur, and I use this device for school work, working on my online store, and for some apps and games that are just entertainment. pro's and con's below:\n\nPros:\n- The major selling point for me was microsoft office. To be able to use word and excel while away from my house without my lugging around my laptop is a pretty big deal for me. I got a keyboard case to go with it of course, but that isn't relevant to this review\n\n-It is fast, I can run multiple apps all day long with no problems at all. searching the web, making documents, playing games are all flawlessly quick.\n\n-Battery life, Did I mention I use this all day? No problems with the battery so far. I just make sure I charge it every night and there are no problems all day long. on the off chance I do forget I plug it in while I am doing something else and it charges reasonably quickly.\n\n-Look and feel. This is a pretty decently built device. It doesn't look or feel cheap. Also the size (8 inch) is perfect.\n\n-Screen clarity and resolution. The screen resolution is the one complaint I have seen on here, but I honestly don't know why. It looks good, and for all of the things I use it for, it is perfect. Sure this isn't an ultra high definition screen, but so what? To each their own I suppose.\n\nCon's\n\n-If I think of any, or anything changes I will edit this review. As of now, literally no complaints.",

                "review_body": "Picked up this tablet recently when the price dipped one evening to about $130 for use as a FPV and telemetry display for flying my Solo quads.  I had been using my Samsung phone, but I wanted a bigger image to help compensate for slightly over 30 eyes.  The 8\" size is perfect, although a tad heavy and about the max that fits in the controller mount.  I had initially tried an older 8\" Lenovo tablet that I already had, but it was incompatible with the app I need to run.  The Tab A is one of the tablets tested to be fully compatible with the app, so I figured I'd just buy one, especially given the price, even though the technology is getting a little dated.  Interestingly, when I'm not out flying, I find myself using this tablet more and more for email, reading the news over coffee in the morning (not CNN or MSNBC fake news!), web searches, Amazon shopping, etc.  It's plenty fast enough for these purposes, the display is sufficiently bright and pleasant to look at, and the battery holds up well for many hours.  It also comes with very usable Microsoft Office apps, although I've so far only found the need to use Word or Excel a couple of times.  The only negative as a FPV display is that the image could be a tad brighter for outdoor use.  But with a sun shade or by standing under a tree to get out of the direct sun, it works pretty well to see where you're flying and to keep track of down-range distance, altitude, flight battery charge state, etc.  For the price paid, this is a really nice tablet in a size that's perfect for me.  Oh yeah, one nice surprise I wasn't expecting: shortly after I started using it, the operating system updated to Android 7!",

                "review_body": "Tl;dr Acer Predator Triton 500 (PT516-52S-73YD) has quality control issues.  Heat dissipation from the GPU goes through the w,a,s,d keys on the keyboard making for VERY uncomfortable gaming unless you use an external keyboard.  GPU started glitching after a week of use.  Acer warranty support technicians couldn\u2019t fix it after 3 attempts and 6 weeks of back-and-forth with their repair center.  The technicians damaged the laptop during the repairs.  Acer Corporate Support tried to replace it with an inferior machine (Acer Nitro 5 with lower specs), which I refused, and Acer has so far refused to issue a refund.\n\nFull story:\n\nMy Acer Predator Triton 500 (PT516-52S-73YD) worked well for about a week.  The keyboard, especially under the w,a,s,d keys, would become uncomfortably hot while playing games.  It seemed all the heat from the GPU was dissipating through some of the most popular keys used in gaming keyboard configurations.  This seems a questionable design choice for a gaming laptop.\n\nAfter about a week, games started to distort, especially in games that utilized fading, video playback, or parallax effects.  Horizontal lines and visual artifacts began appearing during game rendering.  It even affected games with less demanding requirements (e.g. Terraria) and demanding but less visually intense games (e.g. XCOM: Enemy Unknown). The problem became progressively worse over time, and eventually became so bad that games were unplayable.\n\nI sent the laptop back to Acer for repair.  They sent it back unfixed (they just updated the drivers and re-installed the OS, which I had already tried myself).  Immediately sent it back, telling them it was likely a problem with the GPU and explaining exact instructions on how to reproduce the issue. They sent it back unfixed (they replaced the mainboard this time).  Immediately sent it back a third time, this time including a video showing exactly how to reproduce the issue.  They sent it back unfixed (they replaced the mainboard again and the LCD display, damaging my laptop lid in the process).  This whole process took 6 weeks.\n\nI called support, they said all I could do is send it back again.  They said there was no way to escalate the issue or otherwise complain.  I just had to put up with their process.\n\nI ended up calling the Acer corporate number.  I was eventually connected with a \u201cCorporate Customer Support\u201d rep.  That rep tried to offer me a new laptop, a Nitro 5, and tried to pass it off as an upgrade because it had a 2TB hard drive and more memory.  Sure, a bigger hard-drive, but the memory was DDR 4 vs DDR5 and the Nitro 5 they offered had a significantly smaller display resolution and slower refresh rate compared to the Acer Predator Triton 500 I originally purchased.  Plus, the Nitro 5 has a cheaper construction quality (more plastic on the chassis; heavier components; thicker, less portable body; etc).  I declined their offer and asked for them to commit to sending me an exact replacement for the model I purchased (Predator Triton 500).  All I wanted was a commitment that they\u2019d do this, but said they could not make this commitment in a timely fashion, so I requested a full refund.\n\nAs of the time of this writing, it\u2019s been a week since I requested the refund, and, despite multiple calls to corporate customer support, they have so far refused to commit to issuing a refund.  I\u2019ve filled out the forms they requested and have provided the proof of purchase they requested.  To be clear, I understand it takes a while for an actual refund to be issued.  All I\u2019m looking for is a commitment that they WILL issue a refund, which they still refuse to give.  The rep I\u2019m working with says that it\u2019s in \u201cthe finance department's hands\u201d, and that I have to wait for them to make a decision on whether or not my machine qualifies for a refund, which the rep says could take \u201cweeks\u201d.  When I asked if I could escalate the issue, the rep said no.\n\nI have given Acer 7 weeks now to make this right and to stand behind the quality of their products.  They\u2019ve so far refused to do so.  In the meantime, they are holding the money I spent on this laptop hostage while I\u2019m left with a broken gaming laptop that does not play games.",

                "review_body": "Since there's no way to award stars in half-point increments, I would round up my rating for the Acer Chromebook 315 from 4.5 to 5. The advantages this model offers are plentiful (especially at this price point), and the functional issues are relatively few. Some of my personal gripes are unfortunately inherent in all Chromebooks, so it seems unfair to penalize a product for simply being what it is. Any cons I list will therefore be restricted to those that I consider deficiencies or limitations in comparison to other Chromebooks--and again, I didn't find many. Even the ones I did find, I wouldn't classify as insurmountable.\n\nDisplay:\n\n>The HD display seems to earn its name. Graphics are crisp and free of distortion, and the 15.6\" display makes even the tiniest icons visible for people with average-to-good eyesight. The display is very aesthetically pleasing overall.\n>I don't personally fall into the \"average-to-good\" eyesight category, unfortunately. I've been extremely nearsighted for most of my life, and developing astigmatism in my teens and mild farsightedness around age 40 have done me zero favors. But I'm also not considered seriously visually impaired, so I don't necessarily expect to have difficulty adjusting my display to make my devices optimally functional. While the Acer 315's display settings can certainly be changed and are fairly straightforward to access, the default settings were so very small that it took me more time than it should have to navigate to the menu where I could adjust them. Even then I had to get uncomfortably close to the screen to make sure I was adjusting the correct ones. I realize this won't be a problem for most users, and I wouldn't remotely consider it a reason to avoid buying this particular product, but for people who fall into a similar \"gray area\" it could come as an unpleasant surprise. Some may even want to have help on hand during setup.\n\nSpeakers:\n\n>Audio quality and options are probably not going to meet the standards of serious music enthusiasts or gamers, but sound quality is better than average, and will suit dedicated Chromebook users just fine. The upward-facing speakers help with projection as well. In fact, you can produce a surprising amount of volume with them, even on lower settings. I also didn't find that audio quality declined in any appreciable way as volume increased.\n\nSystem/processing speed:\n\n>Processing speed seems good, even quite fast at times.\n> I've experienced a few unexplained crashes, although not many, and I was never able to determine whether it was truly an issue with hardware or due to a specific app or operating system error (or a need to update either). Most device users recognize that outdated software can be pretty buggy, and even up-to-date apps are notorious for having issues, so those seem far more likely culprits in occasional crashes. I wouldn't blame any type of hardware, including the Acer 315, without compelling evidence.\n\nBattery life:\n\n>Battery life has so far been excellent. Even under heavy use, a full charge can easily last 4-6 hours, if not more (I haven't ever pushed it to the limit). It also charges quickly and loses very little charge in sleep mode. I haven't timed it exactly, but I've left the Acer 315 in sleep mode with numerous tabs open for 3-4 days at a stretch, and have lost no more than 10% charge in that time. My regular (older) laptop, along with an older, inexpensive Acer Chromebook in my household will both drain to zero and power off if left sleeping for a comparable amount of time. Hopefully this performance won't decline with age.\n\nKeyboard and touchpad:\n\n>The keyboard layout is pretty standard for a Chromebook; the only real variation is in scale. The keys are comfortably large and appropriately responsive. They also seem to have a surface treatment that makes them slightly rough in texture, and thus resistant to oils and dirt. The coating does that job quite well, which is a point in its favor. However, I've found that if my light source hits the keyboard at just the wrong angle, it renders the labels on the keys all but invisible. This is more of a nuisance than anything, but sometimes changes in brightness or light angle are quite subtle, and it can be quite startling to look down after you've been intently focused on a project for some time and realize that you're momentarily unable to orient your fingers to your keys. Even a slight shift brings them right back into focus, but sometimes even slight positional shifts aren't easily obtained in certain environments. (I did verify this effect with other users in my household to be sure that it wasn't an artifact of my own subpar eyesight. It wasn't.)\n>I didn't find the default settings for the touchpad to be intuitive. It was almost *too* responsive, but seemingly only in certain regions. This led to a very frustrating series of unintended exits from various apps, some of which caused me to lose work or progress. Since the options for adjusting the touchpad are quite limited compared to my laptop, it took numerous trial-and-error attempts for me to optimize its function. (And by \"optimize\" I mean that I no longer want to tear my hair out when I use it, not that it's been modified to my personal ideal.)\n\nDesign:\n\n>The entire unit is sleek, lightweight, and highly portable. The keyboard and screen are easily twice the size of the older Chromebook model, but the Acer 315 has a slimmer profile and weighs about the same. In fact, the way its weight is distributed actually makes it feel much lighter. Even the charging cable, while a bit cumbersome, isn't especially difficult to fit in a standard 14-16\" Chromebook case and doesn't add much weight.\n\nOverall, I would consider the Acer 315 a very good value. You can certainly find cheaper Chromebooks that will perform the same basic functions, but if you'd prefer one that looks and feels more like a traditional laptop (or one that offers a little more punch for people who enjoy gaming or music at a hobbyist level and would appreciate the ability to translate some of those activities to a Chromebook without a huge loss in experiential quality), the difference in price between the least expensive models and the Acer 315 is neither extreme nor out of proportion. The primary draw of Chromebooks in general has always been the functionality, mobility, and reduced expense offered by cloud-based systems. The Acer 315 seems to represent a sensible and appealing middle ground for people who find that those systems suit their needs well, but don't want or need to go completely bare-bones to get them.\n\nI received this product in exchange for a fair and honest review.",

(They provide good instructions and whenever I got stuck there are plenty of resources online to help walk you through it.)\n\nThis is perfect for bringing to conferences because it is so lightweight and I actually prefer it now to my regular laptop for most things because it seems to operate more quickly and with fewer delays.\n\nI receive this through Amazon Vine for review purposes, which is the only reason I ever ended up trying out a Chromebook, but now that I've gotten used to it, I find myself preferring this to my regular laptop.\n\nFor the price, I think it's a very good product!",

It's fast and responsive. Does all of the basic tasks you might want it to if you don't need to load special software onto a machine for anything specific. It's not small, at 15\", so it's not your lightest or most portable chromebook option, but it'll fit into most adult backpacks (how I usually carry my stuff) or laptop bags. The screen is decent, and sound is good (it can fill a small room with sound fairly well). It has a built-in MicroSD card reader that I really wish was a normal-sized SD card reader, which I find more useful. The ability to charge via a USB-C cable, from either side of the computer, is handy. I do also wish it had an HDMI port for easier connections to projectors and such. Pretty sure the USB-C port can output the signal if I had the right adapter, but I don't (yet?). Plenty of apps are available from the Play store. Though not certain ones I had hoped for, like my kindle app (Amazon and Google don't get along in Chromebook-land, I guess; I found a workaround in the Kindle cloud reader). Anyway, this is a cheap way to get a fast and useful internet-connected device that does a lot of things well.",

It's not going to be the most amazing chromebook out there, but it's under 300 dollars people!  One of the major pros to this chromebook is it's 15.6 inch screen. This is alot larger than most chromebooks that average about 11 to 14 inches.  It also offers 1080p which sounds great but stretched out across the 15.6 inch screen it does make some graphics and fonts a little bit  blurry. The product page on Amazon says Acer say the battery life lasts up ton10 hours, I'd say that definitely depends on what you're doing. Watching my daughter play on it, I'd say that it lasts at about 7 hours but that's mostly playing games. Another cool feature is the two upward facing speakers that flank both sides of the keyboard, and the touchpad is a rather larger size. This particular chromebook is not a touchscreen screen, but you are able to use the play store which isn pretty awesome being able to use some many apps. It has USB c ports and a headphone Jack port as well. It does come with a web cam, and the outside of the computer is a nice silver.  Overall based on the price point I think this is a great chromebook for kids!",

It is a large laptop which may be good or bad, depending on the person.  The keyboard isn't cramped at all, it has nice-sounding speakers and usb/earphone ports.  The best part is considering what laptops cost, getting this one is within reach of most students.  My daughter and I talked about the cost - I bought my HP laptop with Windows 10 a couple of years ago as a refurbished one at the local computer shop and it still cost me $600 - new, it still, today, is retailing for $1200!

The key board is more spaced out then my work one so although likely better for some that are used to that (for example my wife's power book has similar key board spacing) it throughs me off some because I use my work laptop every day where as this one I use less often. One other thing about the keyboard is that it does have the Home and end keys. If you are a regular user of these keys like I am it can be a bit annoying. I haven't really put it through any major stress, but it seems powerful enough to proforma the tasks I'm using it for.

This is much more user friendly for those who are used to the app setup on a laptop then those of us who grew up on the Windows OS.\n\nI do love that you can get whatever you need on the App store, there is so much cost free technology to dump on and use. The keyboard is wonderful, and silent. I love the screen size, and the clarity is pretty good, but not perfect. It isn't the ideal machine if you are looking for solid graphics and resolution. The speed of the machine is pretty good overall for what we use it for.\n\nYou do need a Google account to setup the machine. IF you have a Samsung phone, you already have one, or if you use a Google calendar, etc. Not hard, just another step (but cost free) if you don't have a Google account.\n\nBasically this is a good student machine.

I also like Acer products.  We own both Acer desk top computers and Acer Chromebooks.  We basically use the Chromebooks for internet browsing, social media and Netflix viewing.  Obviously, those things can be done on cell phones and smaller devices, but we prefer a larger screen.  This Acer Chromebook 315 is a very nice Chromebook.  It is a definite upgrade from the Acer Chromebook N3060 I purchased earlier this year.  (It also costs more.)  The first thing I noticed was how sleek looking it was; I love its brushed silver finish and its nice, large screen.  I also noticed that it powers up and operates quickly, has good resolution and has good speakers.  I thought it might have a backlit keyboard, but that is on the touch screen versions (CB315-2HT), which are a bit more expensive.  (There are currently 6 different versions of the Chromebook 315 on the Acer website.)  For those who have not used a Chromebook before, be aware that Chromebook does not utilize Microsoft Office; it runs on Chrome OS.  However, Chrome OS can edit, download, and convert the Microsoft Office files in Google Docs, Sheets and Slides.  In addition, a Chromebook does not have a CD/DVD drive, but an external drive can be attached.  Bottom line, we like this Chromebook:  It looks good and performs well.\n\nThat basically sums up my personal viewpoint.  However, this Chromebook offers a lot, more than the usual Chromebook, and the above paragraph doesn\u2019t address all of that.  Here is some additional information taken from the Acer website:  \u201cThis impressive Acer Chromebook 315 is an ideal replacement for a desktop. Its large screen and upward facing speakers make it perfect for watching videos and video conferencing.  It is Acer\u2019s first Chromebook powered by AMD A-Series Processors with Radeon Graphics.  The processors enable customers to stream video, run the latest apps, play web games and browse the Internet effortlessly.  It also supports millions of Android apps on Google Play for entertainment, productivity, connectivity and more.\u201d\n\nAlthough I use a computer and cell phone daily, I am not one for technical data/specs.  For those who are, the following information was taken from the Acer website.  (More information is included here than on this Amazon web page.)\n\nOPERATING SYSTEM\nOperating System:  Chrome OS\u2122\nPROCESSOR AND CHIPSET\nProcessor Manufacturer:  AMD\nProcessor Type:  A-Series\nProcessor Model:  A4-9120C\nProcessor Speed:  1.60 GHz\nProcessor Core:  Dual-core (2 Core\u2122)\nDISPLAY AND GRAPHICS\nGraphics Controller Manufacturer:  AMD\nGraphics Controller Model:  Radeon\u2122 R4 Graphics\nGraphics Memory Technology:  DDR4 SDRAM\nGraphics Memory Accessibility:  Shared\nScreen Size:  15.6\"\nDisplay Screen Type:  LCD\nDisplay Screen Technology:  ComfyView; In-plane Switching (IPS) Technology\nScreen Mode:  Full HD\nBacklight Technology:  LED\nScreen Resolution:  1920 x 1080\nMEMORY\nStandard Memory:  4 GB\nMemory Technology:  DDR4 SDRAM\nMemory Card Reader:  Yes\nMemory Card Supported:  microSD\nSTORAGE\nOptical Drive Type:  No\nFlash Memory Capacity:  32 GB\nNETWORK AND COMMUNICATION\nWireless LAN Standard:  IEEE 802.11ac\nBluetooth Standard:  Bluetooth 4.1\nBUILT-IN DEVICES\nFinger Print Reader:  No\nINTERFACES/PORTS\nTotal Number of USB Ports:  4\nUSB Type-C:  Yes\nSOFTWARE\nOperating System:  Chrome OS\u2122\nINPUT DEVICES\nPointing Device Type:  TouchPad\nKeyboard:  Yes\nBATTERY INFORMATION\nNumber of Cells:  3-cell\nBattery Chemistry:  Lithium Ion (Li-Ion)\nBattery Capacity:  4670 mAh\nMaximum Battery Run Time:  10 Hour\nPOWER DESCRIPTION\nMaximum Power Supply Wattage:  45 W\nPHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS\nHeight:  0.8\"\nWidth:  15\u201d\nDepth:  10.1\u201d\nWeight (Approximate):  3.97 lb\n\nIn conclusion, this Acer Chromebook 315 is an excellent Chromebook, more advanced than previous models.

Because it doesn\u2019t have a disk drive, it boots up very quickly and she really likes this feature. It is lightweight and small with a 15.6\u201d screen. She also mostly uses it to surf the net and check email. This device is good for users that have only these basic needs. Be aware that you will be operating within the Google environment \u2013 Linux-based Chrome OS, Chrome browser, Gmail, etc. The Google OS will not recognize MPG video files, unfortunately. The device has 2 USB-C ports and 2 USB 3.0 ports. The worst negative feature is the screen resolution. There is no way it is high definition, the way the manufacturer states. The so-called \u201cComfyView\u201d HD \u2013 1366 x 768 provides a viewing experience that really strains my mom\u2019s eyes. Beyond the crappy resolution, you have to look at the screen head-on to be able to read anything because the viewing angle is so narrow. I couldn\u2019t figure out a way to permanently enlarge the text on the screen for her. This really would be a great device for seniors if it had decent screen resolution. I can\u2019t even imagine trying to watch movies on this thing.",

                "review_body": "I'm not a computer expert and this review will be strictly from a layman's viewpoint. I had another Chrome Book a couple of years ago and it died on me within weeks (battery issues that I had to have repaired repeatedly) so I've been using this for a while to make sure it actually kept working (it has).\n\nThere's a slight learning curve if you're switching to a Chrome Book from a traditional laptop or desktop computer. This doesn't have nearly the same amount of pure function; yes, there are apps available through the Google Play store for just about anything but it still won't help this machine edit images and videos like a laptop or process documents like a Windows-based system. It's a basic computer for basic tasks like watching Netflix or Hulu (great screen resolution), surfing the internet and document processing via Google Docs.\n\nAs far as performance, it's good for what it is. There are a number of things I'm still having a difficult time with: the keyboard is smaller than usual and it takes me a bit each time to get my hands in the right place so I'm not typing gibberish; the touchpad is kind of a mess - sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't and the right-click has to be done with a great deal of finesse and two fingers pressed on a very specific (occasionally random) place on the pad. The entire thing freezes up on me sometimes and I generally don't do much beyond basic word processing, a little web surfing and organizing files.\n\nFor its price point, this is a fairly decent choice if you aren't married to the idea of a Windows laptop. I will always wish it had more function but the truth is, I don't do the same kinds of things on a computer that I used to (gaming, photo editing) and this will probably be more than enough.",

                "review_body": "First, this is not meant to be a laptop.  As a Chromebook, the primary function of this device is to work through the Google/Chrome interface to accomplish what you need to do.  As such, RAM needs are smaller than a laptop's (not running anything but a browser or Android apps) and the hard drive doesn't need to be that large (though if you want a lot of apps or a lot of media to watch or listen to offline, you will need a microSD card).  It also relies primarily on being connected to the Internet.  You can do things offline, but its strength is working online.  So, knowing what this is, and how it's intended to be used, it works as expected.\n\nBecause this is 15.6 inches, the keyboard is full size and is comfortable to use.  However, the lack of page up/page down keys or a delete key is a frustration for working in a document.  Because this is a Chromebook, though, you get some extra keys for working in the browser that are nice to have to make a mouse less necessary.  There are keys for back, forward, and refresh, as well as full screen and going back.  There are also volume up, volume down, and mute keys.  Again, working through a browser (or an Android interface, these are nice.  The screen is easy to read at its size, but like many reviewers say, it's not as sharp as you would expect.  It falls into that \"good enough\" category.  I work mostly with documents, so I'm not worried about my hi-def video experience.\n\nIt has two USB-C and two USB-A (the rectangular one we always put things in upside down in) 3.1 ports, so connecting peripherals is no problem.  The Chromebook also charges through either USB-C port.  There is also a microSD slot for that oh-so-necessary offline storage.  It worked just fine with a 256GB SanDisk microSD card I tried.  Battery life runs about 7 hours so far, though I know after discharging and recharging a few times it may go up a little.  Size and weight are very good.  It's less than an inch when closed, and though the specs say 6 pounds, it feels lighter than that.  Built-in webcam, microphone and speakers (which are surprisingly good) make this good for video chatting as well.\n\nAll told, this is very nice machine for performing the basics.  I experienced no lag on videos (from the drive and the microSD card), and the few apps I loaded were snappy.  I didn't do any gaming, but this should work pretty much like an Android tablet for that, so if it runs well on a tablet, it should run well here.  It's not a fully loaded laptop, but it's not meant to be, and for what it is, there are no complaints.  Older adults or school age children will find it more than adequate, and even other users will not be disappointed in having it do what it's meant for.",

                "review_body": "I won't get into Chromebook vs tablet vs laptop--- that's outside the scope of a product review, and I'm writing the review based on the assumption that you are definitely in the market for a Chromebook.\n\nMy bottom line is that the 315 is a good buy. It isn't perfect but for the price it offers a lot.\n\nFeatures including several USB C ports, an A port, and a microSD slot, which is a good thing to augment the rather vanilla 32 GB internal storage. It comes with 4 GB of RAM, which is fine for nearly all Chromebook uses. The screen is just over 15 inches with HD resolution in 1920x1080 native. The built-in keyboard looks lost in the body of the unit, but it's full-size for the most part. Upward facing speakers run down each side of the keyboard. The touchpad is truly enormous.\n\nThe unit uses a dedicated charger though it appears you could charge it more slowly from a USB charger with less current capacity. You can charge through any of the USB C ports, which is very convenient.\n\nWifi is 802.11ac (and lower) dual band. Very fast, and it's today's standard.\n\nSet-up is trivial. Connect to wifi, log in to your Google account, let the software update and that's it. You'll surely want to adjust the touchpad speed and some other things, but that's easy enough. There is an online manual (as usual these days, very little documentation comes in the box).\n\nI had no objections to the display, although it seems not everyone likes it. I thought the colors were good and the resolution quite good enough. Yes, there are other devices with higher resolution. For most internet and media consumption, you'll do fine with this device. You aren't going to be editing 4k videos with it, but it never was sold for that.\n\nPerformance is fast and snappy. You can install Android apps very easily and most (not all) work as expected. There is also a Linux subsystem feature, which gives you even more options, but that isn't yet fully developed.\n\nThis unit doesn't have a touch screen. I consider that a feature rather than a lack. This isn't a tablet and the touchpad lets you do everything you want without having to lift your hand and poke at the screen.\n\nThe keyboard is okay. The tactile feel is good enough if nothing special. There are some compromises --- you have to fool with an auxiliary key to get function keys, the arrows are half size, there is no explicit page up/page down and many others are missing, but there are combination chords available for some of the missing things. Still, this is probably the weakest part of the ensemble. Given all the real estate available, this could and should have been done much better.\n\nBluetooth works as expected with no issues; just be aware that it's on by default. Turn it off to save a little on battery if not in use.\n\nBattery life is easily 6 hours, depending on usage, and can be as much as 10. It's enough for a day's intermittent work or a longish flight (okay, not L.A. to Paris, but still).\n\nThe unit has a beautiful brushed aluminum finish (must be back in style again?). It is heavier and larger than I might like, but you can't get a 15.6 inch screen into a small case, either. Definitely buy a sleeve for this so the aluminum doesn't scratch.\n\nAs to build quality it seems quite sturdy and well made.\n\nThis is a very good deal on a Chromebook. There is a lot here for the price. It is not perfect, and I do take one star off for the keyboard and the weight. So four stars as my bottom line.",

The hope was that our school aged child could use the computer for school work and entertainment, and that the adults could use it for surfing the internet, streaming media, answering email, and doing some work related tasks and projects.\n\nPros:\n\nIt is light and sleek, with a hard durable case.\nWe have been able to watch movies and shows on Netflix, Hulu, YouTube, and Amazon Prime with no problems.\nWe use this computer in the kitchen to look up recipes.\nThis computer was great when we needed to watch a how-to Netflix video for a DIY appliance repair. It is better than continually consulting our smartphones.\nWe use this computer to stream podcasts and audio books. The sound is a little tinny, but decent quality.\nThis computer is fast to start and load webpages.\nWe use this computer to watch videos and shows when we are exercising at home.\n\nCons:\n\nThe touchpad and keyboard don't feel very intuitive. The touchpad feels more sluggish than others we have used. You  can hook a mouse up to the computer, which helps a bit.\nFor a fast typist, this is a frustrating keyboard to use. It slowed us down and we made more typos than usual. It is not a great computer to use to type out a long email, or update a google spreadsheet or work on your novel in a google doc.\nThe screen is pretty awful. Text on webpages looks small and a little fuzzy. I'm a 40-something adult and have to constantly zoom in to make the text bigger on every page and then I still feel like I'm squinting and getting a headache. Ideal for a kid doing a quick homework assignment. Not ideal for a far-sighted adult working on a writing project, reading long news articles, or answering more than a few emails.\nVideo quality is disappointing. It satisfies the child who wants to watch cartoons, but an adult trying to have a quality video watching experience is going to be disappointed.\n\nVerdict:\nYou get what you pay for. For the cost, $300, this computer suits our basic home entertainment and web surfing needs. It is an easy computer for a child to use. If you are a college student or professional who needs a computer to do actual work on, this is not going to meet your needs",

I can't even use Zoom with everything else closed, and it's NOT my internet service because everything else I have works fine.  It also feels cheaper than the other one i have - the body is very plastic feeling...well it is plastic so what else would I expect.

I wanted to build my own but did not want to pay the current market inflated prices for a video card.\n\nAfter researching the brand (MSI) for its products (motherboards and video cards mainly), I compared this offerings against the open market (brick and mortar stores and online computer sellers) for turn-key systems from the main name brands and some of the boutique makers.  This unit was the best 'value' and price for what it actually offered (DDR5, 12th gen i7 CPU, RTX video card, and m2 SSD 3Gb/s hard drive, liquid cooling).\n\nThe box was well packed (no issues with damage in delivery) and everything worked at boot up time.\n\nIts VERY fast - I installed benchmarking software (PassMark) and it scored in the 98%-tile overall.  Being a former hardware builder and tweaker, I fiddled with the overclocking software - very easy to use and had gained a modest bump.  Even in stock settings, it plays the newest games with all settings maxed out (at 2550x1440 resolution, 144hz) with a very high frame rate.  It supports 4k but I cannot afford a 4k monitor.....\n\nI have been very impressed and would recommend.",

However, two hours in I got a \"Watchdog Violation,\" and the computer blue-screened. When it turned back on it would only load to BIOS and no longer recognized that the M2 drive was installed in the motherboard. Nothing I tried would get it to load to the boot drive. I contacted technical support and they told me to return it which I did. I have since ordered a new one directly from the manufacturer, because again, prior to the blue screen it worked fine. I give it one star here purely because I cannot excuse a 2-hour lifespan...hopefully if you decide to get it the computer it will live longer. If possible, I will update you with how the direct from the manufacturer version goes.\n\nEdit:\nAfter returning the one from Amazon, I ordered a new one directly from the manufacturer. The one from the manufacturer took a week to arrive, but so far (about 5 days in) it works great. It runs fast and cool. I updated the star rating from 1 to 4 stars because I expect a version even from Amazon to work just as well as one directly from the manufacturer. Although I have not run the highest spec games on it so far, however, I have run CPU intensive games usually do not get the CPU above 50 C and only has a CPU usage of about 40%. RAM is DDR5 and has run fine, most of the time only 50% of the 16GB is being used. The MSI center runs a little weird and seems like it is trying to base GPU numbers on the integrated graphics and not the 3070ti, but Nvidia can give you numbers on the GPU. Hopefully, this computer lasts a while, glad to know I got a year warranty from MSI.",

Either the motherboard is warped, not mounted properly in the case, or the I/O shield is not stamped properly, and cables cannot be plugged into several of the rear ports.\n\nI noticed that another Amazon customer had the same problem, and posted a photo before returning the system.\n\nThe photo posted to Amazon looked so much the same as mine, that I thought it might be possible that the defective system had been sent back out to me, until I searched the web, and this appears to be  a common defect and is happening a lot to MSI customers.\n\nRather than rip this thing apart and diagnose the problem, I called Amazon to replace it.\n\nAt first the Amazon rep said that, because this is a high dollar item, I would have to return it for a refund and repurchase it, effectively losing my black Friday discount. Then he called this a minor defect, and I corrected him that not being able use use some of the important ports of a new system (LAN, keyboard USB, mouse USB) is NOT a minor defect.\n\nHe said Amazon could not replace the system because it was a high dollar item, and could only refund it. I told him that this was not acceptable, and he checked with a supervisor. He then said that they could not replace the system because they didn't have any more in stock. I am pretty sure I verified that they had some in stock before I called Amazon, but I checked and indeed it was out of stock.\n\nI asked if I could get it replaced by MSI since it was a new system shipped with a defect. He brought a MSI customer rep on line by the name of Hank to see if MSI could replace this defective system. Hank said that, since the system was sold by Amazon, MSI could not replace the system. I could send it in for warranty repair, but I would receive a refurbished system to replace my new, defective system, and that is not acceptable.\n\nWe finally agreed that Amazon would replace the system if they got a replacement in stock before my return window closes. I offered that I would not boot or initialize the system to make it easier for MSI to process the return and repair the defect, and the Amazon rep thanked me for that.\n\nI am waiting for Amazon to get this product back in stock so I can keep my black Friday discount. I noticed that there is another vendor that has this product in stock for the same price as my black Friday discount with good reviews on Amazon, but searching reviews outside of Amazon I found many complaints, and I also found complaints with the Better Business Bureau, some of which seem to be unresolved, so I have decided not to purchase from them.",

I do photo editing with photoshop and lightroom and this alder lake processor is fantastic. Smoothly loads high resolution images. Gaming performance is stellar and i believe the 3070 TI is the best value for ultra 1440p gaming and moderate 4k gaming as well. I got the PC at around 2000 during a brief sale so i got very good value but even at 2100 its still great value for the kind of performance you get.\n\nSystem runs cool and I'm a big fan of the somewhat understated design of the case. I like RGB and all but the fact that there is a button on the pc that can cycle the different light schemes and turn the RBG off is very practical and welcomed feature. I chose MSI because of their reputation for quality and quality is what i got. No regrets",

Interesting, that according to HP, the warranty began on March 31, 2021 and expired March 31, 2022. Wow! So the warranty started 2 months before we bought the device and ended THE DAY BEFORE IT DIED?!?! That is exceedingly convenient for HP. BEWARE!

                "review_body": "I had a problem with the first generation of the Surface Book where the battery of the tablet portion would refuse to charge. Between hardware improvements and firmware updates, this seems solved now. So I highly recommend this laptop.\n\nPros:\n\nThe detachable tablet mode is great. If you want to view a recipe in the kitchen, read a book on the screen without the weight of the base - tablet mode is great and easy to use.\n\nThe Surface Pen is mostly great. They sell a pack of interchangeable tips on the website. I've done some light drawing and various activities with the pen and the touchscreen - all input modes are great.\n\nPlenty of ports. Unlike some competitors (Apple) this Surface has plenty of USB \"type A\" ports which makes it compatible with your existing peripherals.\n\nCons:\n\nThe second generation is notably heavier than the first. My wife finds it to be fairly cumbersome, and prefers the Surface Pro for weight reasons.\n\nFirmware is still iffy. I did have a battery charging problem at one point, caused by bad drivers. The laptop battery was at 0% so it only worked connected to the base. I researched online and found out I had to uninstall the battery driver, and restart the system, to resolve it. If my base battery had been dead, the laptop would have been dead. Microsoft is not perfect yet, but they're a lot better than they used to be.\n\nOverall:\n\nA lovely laptop. Expensive, but feature-rich. As a great mobile laptop, drawing tablet, or general-purpose laptop this is a great choice.",

                "review_body": "I have a Microsoft Surface tablet, so this is a bit of leap-of-faith.  I did not like the Surface tablet due to its light integration with the keyboard. This device however is solid.  It can be fully used like a laptop on your lap, as well as a tablet when it is disconnected.\nLike the Surface tablet though it lacks access to a sizable amount of apps that an ipad or an Android app would have, so impacts its use as a tablet.\n\nHowever as a laptop, it\u2019s pretty decent.\n\nITS SPECS\n**** Intel 7th Gen Core i5\n**** 8GB RAM\n**** 256 GB Solid state\n**** Intel HD Graphics 620\n**** Display resolution max: 3000 x 2000 pixels\n**** 13.5 PixelSense Touchscreen with pen input\n**** 17 hour battery life\n\nWHAT YOU GET:\nThe Surface Book itself which is a tablet attached to a keyboard. This is a well integrated connection, that makes you think of it as a 13\u201d laptop. Detaching the tablet is a simple button push.  Reattaching it is as simple as pushing the two pieces back together.  This is an electronic release and relatch, and amazingly the laptop does not have to be turned on, to detach or attach.\n\nLIGHTING KEYBOARD\nThe keyboard, is a lighting keyboard and I have noted when using it on your lap it can be hard to see the symbols on the keys, at the initial setting. . The contrast of the key color to the symbol color is quite low at the initial setting of the keyboard lighting.  So I have found myself in a fairly well lit room having to turn up the keyboard lighting, or turning it off entirely. Simple enough, but it concerned me at first. Once I tweaked the setting, it was fine.\n\nPOWER CABLES\nThe power cables which are in two pieces.  One from the computer to the transformer, which is the magnetic catch type seen in the Surface tablets.  The other is the transformer to the wall plug. This is a pet peeve of mine.  Here you have this elegant lap top solution and this big clunking transformer block.  You can slip this beautiful computer into a nice case, only to have this behemoth block, you need to find space for.  Granted it has sleeker lines that others, but it would be nice to have it a whole lot slimmer and an easy way to wrap up the cord\n\nSETUP:\nSetup is your typical Windows PC setup. This one like the tablet includes face recognition which is nice. Lighting can confuse it and you might have to repeat this process, but it is worth it. Sometimes too when it is looking for you, you may not have the top fully open, so the camera can\u2019t see you.  Then you just put in your pin.\n\nUSAGE:\nI\u2019ve written all this review on this system, which isn\u2019t that much typing, but being a touch typer, if the keyboard was set funny would have me swearing by now.  I once had an iPad keyboard solution that moved a few keys for size.  Drove me batty. While you don\u2019t think you use a comma much, go ahead and move that on your keyboard and find out. This keyboard is nice and has the right feel.\nBattery life is great. I\u2019ve used it for hours and hours and plugged it in only after I noted it was in the 50% range.\nLap use. One thing that makes a laptop nice is its portability and this one with the 13.5\u201d display makes it like a small laptop and it is  light and easy to carry around. . Even though the tablet is a heavier display, it does not cause balance issues on your lap when using as a laptop.\n\nOTHERS OPINIONS:\nI brought this device into work, to show two much younger colleagues that were enthusiastic to see  what it could do and how it was set up.\nAfter playing with it for a day, I learned a few things.\nYou can charge the tablet separate from the keyboard, there is a slot on the side of the tablet.  I had never looked but this makes sense.\nI thought the default display size for a browser, seemed small. But, being as I\u2019m older did not trust that. They are in their mid twenties (both UI people) and they thought the size was small too.  Whenever you go to change this it gives you a warning and that other apps might be blurry but you could optimize for this. It kind of bothers me that the default is in the range of less usable.  We found the display default was 200%, we preferred 250%.\n\nBoth of them were unsure this product would have a use for them.\nOne had a PC desktop at home and a Mac laptop with a Mac laptop at work, so he was versed in both PC and Mac, but had no use for a laptop of this type and since this was a Windows tablet it\u2019s appeal was limited.\nThe other had a Mac laptop at home and at work, but regularly does Microsoft app training, so was versed in Microsoft products. He felt the heavier screen since it was a separate tablet, made it unbalanced as a laptop.  Though he was a graphic designer, the removable tablet that you could draw on, had no appeal.  While he indicated this device was the best example of a 2 in 1 laptops, he was not sure he had a need for that type of device in retrospect.\n\nTheir joint concern was similar to mine in that usage as a tablet is limited by the available software. In order to give this device a fair shake, I was going to investigate what type of software for use in a tablet was available for this device.\n\nSOFTWARE FOR THE WINDOWS TABLET:\nI spent some time looking around on the tablet for Software. There seems to be a decent amount of Free pen drawing software (as well as ones you can buy) and a range of productivity software that is both paid and unpaid.  I don\u2019t see a tremendous amount of games and that would typically be my use in a tablet form, along with maybe drawing.  So again, and like my colleagues this is a very limited tablet relative to an Apple or Android one.\n\nOVERALL OPINION\nFor my own opinion, this is a PC laptop and not much of a tablet, unless I can find Windows apps to use.  As I noted above, I did find ones for the pen. But I can\u2019t play the games I typically play on my ipad or my Android phone, because they are not on Windows. I have heard that Microsoft is coming out with a Microsoft Surface phone that is Android based. As much as this might irk Microsoft using a competitors OS, this would address the lack of usability of this tablet.\nMind you, if you would to buy a 2 in 1 laptop of any kind it would have the same issue.\n\nRelative to PC laptops, if I put the specs into Dell or look online, this Surface book is priced comparable to a 2 in 1 laptop, except it specs for the display are 2X what the competition offers.",

                "review_body": "As a Vine reviewer, I am in an interesting position \u2013 I can compare this 2019 13.5\u201d Surface Book 2 (SB2) to its larger cousin from 2017, the 15\u201d Surface Book 2. You might be thinking: why is it called the same thing when it\u2019s 2 years apart? Well, it was late 2017 and early 2019, so it\u2019s more like 1.5 years, and I guess Microsoft just wanted to do a CPU refresh and not a wholesale overhaul. So you will be able to tell which is which by the CPU \u2013 Microsoft and Amazon call them the 7th Generation Core i5 and the 8th generation models, respectively. Pay close attention to this label, as often it is the only thing distinguishing the 2019 refresh from the 2017 original.\n\nThe SB2 model I am reviewing is the 8th gen Core i5, with 8gb of RAM and a 256gb SDD storage drive. GPU duties are handled by the Intel HD620 chip, which is included on the same die as the CPU. I am comparing it to my 15\u201d SB2, with a 7th gen Core i7 CPU, paired with an nVidia GTX1060 GPU and 16gb of RAM.\n\n*Productivity*\n\nThe 8th gen Core i5 and 8gb of RAM are more than powerful enough to make regular PC tasks like web surfing and word processing smooth as butter. You will not bog this machine down no matter how many browser tabs you have open.\n\nNow that we are in e-learning and zoom meetings for work, I have found that the Surface Book cameras are really terrific. They look better than everyone else's we see in our school meetings. Pen input is also really useful for school assignments, both coloring and writing.\n\n*Gaming*\n\nCurrent 3D gaming is not really feasible on this unit. By this, I mean resource-intensive games like Hitman, Injustice 2, or Batman Arkham Knight. Both Hitman and Injustice 2 had to be reduced to quite ugly settings to run, and still stuttered quite badly. Arkham Knight wouldn\u2019t even load. So you need to manage your expectations for Intel HD620 performance. It\u2019s not equivalent to a modern GPU (like the SB2 15\u201d model\u2019s nVidia GTX1060). With that said, older 3D games run fine (like Portal 2 at high resolutions, The Talos Principle at middle resolutions, and even Skyrim on slightly reduced settings), and the CPU and display perform quite nicely on games like Civilization VI, Pac-Man Championship Edition, Braid, and Pinball Arcade/Pinball FX3. So it\u2019s not a \u201cgaming laptop\u201d per se, but it can do some light gaming on the side.\n\n*Drawing*\n\nI do a lot of drawing on my 15\u201d Surface Book 2. It has an nVidia GPU to help with rendering speed, so any difference in performance is something I am keenly interested in. I can report happily that the drawing performance on the 8th gen 13.5\u201d SB2 in programs like Autodesk Sketchbook, Fresh Paint, and Medibang Pro is typically excellent for Surface products. I detected no differences between this unit and my SB2 Core i7 15\u201d model.  That\u2019s really saying something, too. Strokes are smooth and precise, and the pressure sensing is excellent. Photoshop on the i5 model does start to bog down with large brushes, but the pen performance is still good. All Surface models perform better with the pen while plugged in - running on battery seems to reduce jitter correction.\n\n*Build Quality*\n\nThe 3000x2000 display is truly beautiful. It is every bit the equal of the 15\u201d display, just slightly smaller. The colors pop but are not unnatural, the blacks are inky deep and do not shift at all when viewed from off angles. The resolution provides more than enough detail for a 1080p video. It is a bit below 4k resolution, but can provide almost all of that detail as well. Text is crisp and clean with no visible stair-stepping or pixels. At full brightness, it can compete with sunny room reflections. All in all, a total home run for a 13.5 inch screen.\n\nAudio is quite good, with two front firing speakers located on the tablet portion. It is loud enough to fill a small room if you are watching a movie or listening to music, and there is no distortion at high volumes. There isn\u2019t a whole lot of bass response, but it doesn\u2019t sound tinny. There must be some decent psycho-acoustics at work approximating the bass elements of a particular audio presentation.\n\nThe keyboard and track pad are arguably the best in the industry right now, equaling the Macbook\u2019s old keyboard (and far outclassing their recent butterfly keyboards). Key travel is wonderful and satisfying, and the track pad is precise, with a good firm click, and gestures that just work.\n\nThe unit itself is admirably thin. When placed on a table, the hand can hardly feel the body of the keyboard, it is so slender. The hinge functions without a hitch, releasing the tablet and reattaching it with a satisfying click. The tablet is certainly more manageable than the 15\u201d, but still feels kind of ridiculously large compared to an iPad or Android equivalent.\n\nThe port selection is moderate, with 2 full-size USB 3.0 plugs and a full-size SD-card slot on the left, and 1 USB-C port on the right. The headphone jack resides on the tablet, unfortunately placed on the top right.\n\n*Battery Life*\n\nThere are two batteries in this laptop, one in the keyboard base and one in the tablet. Both batteries are listed separately in Windows 10\u2019s tool tray battery display. I did a run-down test \u2013 watching a 1080p movie via YouTube at half brightness and half volume, some light gaming, and web browsing, and the combined battery life between the two units was quite nice \u2013 a good 9-10 hours should be easily achievable at these sorts of moderate settings. The tablet alone will only get 3-4 hours, though.\n\n*Who is this for?*\n\nThe question you need to ask yourself is if this unit is right for you. There are better gaming laptops to be had for equivalent money, certainly. And if you just want web browsing, you can get a very nice laptop from Dell or HP for about half the price. To me, the unique selling point is the Surface Pen and flippable tablet function. Turning the tablet around and closing the lid makes this a heck of a nice drawing pad \u2013 something I use frequently, but you might not.\n\nThis 13.5\u201d Surface Book is also quite a bit more portable than the 15\u201d, weighing significantly less and monopolizing far less bag space. But then, it\u2019s not as portable as the Surface Pro with keyboard cover, which performs just as well as a drawing pad. So it\u2019s kind of in a weird spot.\n\nIf you want to game relatively seriously and draw at home, then the 8th gen 13.5\u201d sporting a GTX1050, or the 7th gen 15\u201d with the GTX1060 are probably better bets for you. They are way more powerful to game on, and the 15\u201d has more surface area for drawing on the screen.\n\nOn the other hand, If you want to draw and browse on the go, then the Surface Pro is probably a better fit. I was very seriously considering buying a smaller Surface tablet to have a more portable drawing slate. The Surface tablet with a Core i5 CPU/8gb RAM/128gb storage runs for about half the price of the 8th gen SB2 at around $700. That difference will buy you a lot of accessories, such as the Surface Pen, a keyboard cover, and a nice beefy SD card to augment storage. If you go with the SB2, you get a terrific keyboard but still have to buy the pen and any additional storage.\n\nPlease don\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 the Surface Book 2 is a whale of a laptop, in whichever iteration you choose. It\u2019s beautifully designed, in the way that, say, Apple\u2019s best machines are. I just kind of think these mid-range iterations are a bit underpowered for the price, and that you can easily find smaller form factors or more powerful graphical muscle for less money. As such, I think it\u2019s a 4 star machine. If it included the Surface Pen and had more storage for the price, I could probably be persuaded to go with 5 stars.",

                "review_body": "For starters, since Amazon mixes everything together, here are the specs of the Surface Book that I'm reviewing:\n\nSurface Book 2 13.5\" screen\n8gb RAM\n256gb storage\nIntel Core i5-8350U CPU\n\nHaving both a 2018 Macbook Pro (from work) and this, it's easy to see that Microsoft wants to target Macbook customers. Build quality is very similar. The Surface Book feels solid and its magnesium body feels great. It's a little warmer feeling than the cold aluminum used in the Macbook. And, like the Macbook, it's beautiful. It's not as svelte as a Macbook, however, but that's just the nature of the beast. When you pack all of the electronics into the screen, it's just going to be thicker, and the clever hinge is engineered in such a way that it can hold up all that weight. It's very cool looking too - like an accordion, it cinches up on itself as you close it and expands when you open it. It makes for a thicker hinge area, though, so even though the \"clipboard\" (screen/tablet) portion just a little thicker than 1/4\", when folded over on the keyboard section (which also includes a bigger battery) it's pretty close to 1\" thick.\n\nThis Surface Book was going to be a secondary computer, as I have a big Alienware desktop that I use, but almost immediately I found that I simply enjoyed using the Surface Book much more. It's not even about portability, as I use it most often at my desk plugged into a monitor. It's that the Surface Book is fast and nimble in ways my 5 year old Alienware machine is not. I also prefer the keyboard - it's close to the great keyboards Apple used to put in the Macbooks (several years ago) and is far superior to the \"new\" low-action keyboard in the current Macbooks.\n\nThe touchpad is Apple quality, seriously. I'm shocked, actually, because I've never found any non-Apple trackpads to be particularly nice. With the gestures built into Windows, I'm pretty closely able to recreate the way I work on a Macbook trackpad.\n\nOn the left of the keyboard you'll find two USB 3 ports as well as an SD card slot. On the right is the Surface connector port and a single USB-C. The clipboard houses a single port - the headphone jack - so forget connecting a drive to the clipboard. But the Surface charger will connect directly to the clipboard, if that appeals to you. It really feels as if Microsoft doesn't *really* want you to use the clipboard by itself.\n\nI use this computer for pretty much everything now. I'm an amateur photographer and pretty bad artist, so I use Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom a lot along with Sketchable (available in the Windows app store.) Photoshop is a demanding beast. It will take around 5 minutes to open on my Alienware box but on the Surface it opens just about as fast as on my Macbook Pro, which is around 20 seconds or so. For normal tasks like lightly editing a photo it works fine (and Lightroom equally works well for photo edits.) Some of Photoshop's complex brushes, such as the textured Kyle's brushes, push it to its limit and you'll find yourself waiting a moment for the results to catch up on screen. I don't typically use Photoshop for painting, however, and in an app like Sketchable I find that drawing and painting is fluid and extremely smooth.\n\nBut about that painting and drawing...\n\nMicrosoft seriously needs to stop being stingy. The Surface line is *always* advertised with a Surface Pen. They are meant to be together and the Surface Pen really complements the Surface. I knew going in that Surfaces don't include that great Pen, but it doesn't diminish the sting of having to buy one to get the most out of the device. Of course, you can work on the Surface just fine without one, but then it's basically just a touchscreen laptop. I don't know about you, but the appeal of the Surface for me is that I can use multiple methods of input depending on what works best at the time. It's short-sighted and cheap of Microsoft to continue making the Pen an extra charge.\n\nThat said, with the Pen, you can write and draw to your heart's desire. The Pen works beautifully, bested only by Apple's Pencil on the iPad, and they're very close in feel.\n\nThe trick to the Surface Book is that the screen, called the \"clipboard,\" can be removed. It can be used on its own, as it has a small battery inside, but you'll only get a couple hours out of it that way. The main battery is found in the keyboard base and you'll need it if you want to work on it all day. The clipboard can then be flipped around and reconnected, then closed over the keyboard. I call this \"fat tablet\" mode. It gives the screen a small slope, which is nice for drawing, but most of all it lets the keyboard battery be used. This is a great mode in which to draw or take notes. It's a little heavy to hold up like this, not surprisingly, but the clipboard battery life is significantly shorter than it is with the base.\n\nOne little thing bugs me about going into \"fat tablet\" mode. While in laptop mode, you have both an onscreen detach button (found in the ^ menu in the clock tray) as well as a detach button on the keyboard. When you've flipped the screen around, for some dumb reason, the only button that is available to detach again is the one on the keyboard, which is obviously hidden away. Why isn't the on-screen detach button available in this mode? It makes things really awkward.\n\nOther little bits:\n\nSpeakers are actually pretty decent, with the caveat that these are, unsurprisingly, tiny speakers. They're quite loud and clear, but lack bass, which is not shocking.\n\nThe screen is beautiful. Great colors, very sharp, and the touchscreen is very responsive. Now Microsoft just has to match it with a better tablet experience in Windows.\n\nBattery life so far has been excellent. Microsoft's blue-sky estimate of 17 hours is probably not realistic for any actual humans, but in my use so far it's easily enough battery for going all day without a charger, unless you're going heavy on the Photoshop where you'll need to boost the battery for \"best performance\" (or else Photoshop performance will be seriously hindered.) The charger is the typical Surface charger with the proprietary magnetic connector, and the separate housing for the charger includes a USB for charging other devices. Makes you wonder why Microsoft couldn't just include a dock that could connect to your monitor and other devices, doesn't it?\n\nAll said and done, I really enjoy this computer. It's not cheap, I know, and I know you can find faster computers for less, but they also feel like \"less.\" It's important to know what you really want and need out of a computer. For me, I wanted Macbook-like build quality and I've got that here. I also own a Surface Pro 1 that is nearing 6 years old and it still works great, so I have had good experiences with Microsoft devices. I have read of some issues on Surface Books but mine so far has worked flawlessly, and I hope I don't have to change that - but if something happens, I'll definitely update this review to reflect that.",

The keyboard is backlit, and now has a USB-C connection. It is super fast. It\u2019s also perfect as a little movie theater for travel. Set-up was a breeze. The only consideration is that it is a little heavier, which is to be expected with a bigger screen.

Oh, and it looks hot as heck!",

The Surface Book 2 is more powerful but also a lot heavier and bulky than the Surface Pro.  Still, considering the power, responsiveness, and versatility, it it rather light.  The touch screen is surprising useful and very responsive and precise.  The screen color and brightness are excellent, with videos and photos jumping out at you.  The screen is detachable/reversible, which is consuming media content.\n\nThe Surface Book 2 is also more snappy and has a better screen than our new 2019 MacBook Pro.  While the MacBook Pro has kept the same confined design for years, Microsoft has stepped out and created an innovative, useful, functional laptop with lots of speed and zip.  Our new favorite laptop!  The Surface line is amazing.",

I traded in my Macbook Air for this computer and I honestly wish I had saved my money and kept my Mac.  I've had this Surface Book 2 for just about a year and it's working slower than my Mac, which I had for 3 years.  The touch screen is nice and it's cool that it turns into a tablet, but it works so incredibly slow that I cannot open Word and Chrome at the same time because it will crash and turn off.  I am a student, so I mainly use my laptop to do research, write papers, and take notes.  The tablet was a good feature to take notes on, but the processing speed is so slow that it is not worth it.  I take very good care of my computer and it has never been dropped so I don't know why it is acting the way it is, but I was told it would be comparable to my Mac and it is definitely not.",

                "review_body": "This is intended to be the best of both worlds - part tablet PC and part laptop. Unfortunately, the result is that it doesn't do a very good job of either.\n\nTablet features: The screen can un-dock from the keyboard, and re-dock in reverse to make using it as a tablet a bit easier. But the screen is so bulky, that I rarely actually use it as a tablet. I wouldn't think of walking around with just the screen (due to size), and reversing it in a meeting to make note-taking easier is awkward. It is a beautiful touch-screen, but since I use it mostly as a laptop, I rarely use it. The Microsoft Stylus is probably the best on the market - but it costs quite a bit extra.\n\nLaptop features: This is almost as good as a standard laptop. Except that the monitor opens only a little wider than a 90-degree angle. So if you actually want to use it on your lap or on a plane, you may be frustrated.\n\nIn my opinion, you'll be better served purchasing a standard laptop and/or tablet.

                "review_body": "Honestly, this has been a great device for just over three years. Three years being the limit for their responsibility.\n\nThat is the issue though. Last week I noticed that my touch screen was acting weird. On top of that, my batteries began to die very quickly. This week I noticed that the laptop wouldn't close all the way. On closer inspection today, I can see now that My screen is bulging out. The entire top part of my surface book has begun expanding. There are multiple pressure points around the edges of the display and even the metal frame is warped like some sick smile (very noticeably the entire top of the frame is curved).\n\nSo I have had this device just over three years, and because I was a little too late to call them I'm out of luck. This is a known issue with this device and several other surface devices. Do a quick search for \"surface battery swelling\" if you would like. Instead of letting owners know about the potential fire hazard stored in their homes/car/office, they've hidden this info so as to prevent as many as possible from getting it fixed. I cannot afford a new device right now... especially not with both mine and my wife's hours being reduced due to Covid-19.\n\nI called support to see if they could do anything for me and they were willing to send me a refurbished device for $600+tax. When I explained that I couldn't afford that I was told that there were other options I could explore online. I asked where to do that and was directed to Microsoft's home page. I asked for clarification because I was still under the impression this person was trying to help me. They told me to click \"Surface\" in the menu at the top of the screen. I did and it took me to the sales page for their surface line. \"There are lots of options here\" they told me. How in the hell are these \"options\" if I cannot afford the $600 fee for your defective battery?!\n\nNeedless to say I am pissed. My device is in mint condition but I missed the cutoff by a couple weeks for this known and potentially dangerous issue. Microsoft support has washed their hands of me and sent me off with a big middle finger to purchase a new device.",

It still isn't working well with CentOS, but Kubuntu works awesomely, and I also have Kali running.  I've got a tripple boot (with Windows as well) set up, and the whole thing took about 5 hours to set up.  If you're looking for a laptop to run Linux on, that is light and has a great battery, the choice is this one or the XPS.  The XPS (my friend has one) doesn't run touchscreen, but it is lighter than this one and gets even better battery...\n\nOverall, this laptop has a great battery, a great screen, and runs Linux with very little effort.  The only downsides are the requirement to have power connected in order to detach the screen (yes, the button does work in Linux), the fact that all ports (USB, SD and charging included) are on the base (so in tablet mode it can't charge, can't read an SD card, and can't use a USB device), and the fact that it is so sealed that you can't upgrade or repair it yourself.  Those are the reasons I dropped one star (personally, I'd drop 4 stars for all that, but I know most people wouldn't).",

                "review_body": "First, there seems to be some question as to what generation i5 processor is in this model.  It is an 8th generation processor.  I already have a Surface Tablet with the 7th generation i7 in it and I can\u2019t tell any noticeable difference even though this in an i5 instead of the previous generation i7.  My tablet also has 16gb of RAM whereas this \u201cBook\u201d only has 8gb.  Again I have yet to have a problem while running any programs including Adobe CS and third party filters.  I am very impressed with the overall feel of the unit.  I have heard some people express concerns with the keyboards ability to hold up under heavy use.  However, it seems pretty good and the feel of the keys is near perfect to me.  I usually take very good care of my computers so I doubt if I will ever have a problem with it.  However if you are looking for something along the lines of mil-spec hardware built to take anything you can do to it then of course this is not it.  The 13.5 inch screen is bigger than the tablet I have gotten use to using.  On the other hand this PC is much smaller and lighter than my current laptop and that is a good thing.  I ordered a leather case for it and even with that is will be a laptop I would not think twice about taking on the road, which I never do with my big 15 inch laptop.  If I want I can also easily detach the screen from the keyboard and use it as a touch screen only tablet.  I never put much stock in advertised battery run time since so much depends on how each person uses their PC and actual run time can differ significantly between users.  I can say already though that it seems to run significantly longer than my old Surface Tablet and I am happy about that.  I certainly do recommend this laptop.  If you can afford it I would still suggest you max out the processor, RAM, and storage if you feel you may have need of something more powerful.  But if you don\u2019t plan on using it for heavy gaming or other power hungry stuff then the i5 with 8gb RAM should suffice.",

                "review_body": "This surface book is an extremely great device to have. First thing I would say is this is a great laptop. It is a bit on the thicker side compared to many other laptops but with the amount of power it has I see no issues with it. It uses the traditional power brick charger as the surface pro 4 however the actual brick is a bit bigger than usual. The surface is very quick on boot up and does have facial unlock. One of the things I would say about this is that in order to charge it you actually need to have it plugged into the dock and keyboard. You cannot charge the tablet separate from the actual dock. The dock/keyboard itself has its own battery as well as the tablet. You can easily charge the keyboard and dock while using the tablet. I would be careful on how far back you push the screen as the hinge will only go back so far. I would say from the 90 degree it can move back an additional 15 degrees back before it stops. Do not force the tablet screen back any further or you will break it. Another thing is if you are planning to use this on you lap, be careful when opening and closing as the hinge has gaps that your hair or skin can get caught in if you have it on your skin. The external surface is very easy to scratch so I would recommend that you get a skin to protect it or get a laptop case for it. The tablet itself is locked to the keyboard and the only way to remove it is to either detach it in windows or just press the detach button on the top right. It does take a few seconds but you will know it is safe to remove when you hear a click. The tablet can be rotated around and put back into the dock and closed. This makes it nice to turn into a tablet as well as protecting your keyboard. The touch screen is super sensitive as well as accurate. It does not come with a pen however if you are an artist or writer then I would recommend getting one. The facial recognition is great and makes it easy for me to unlock my laptop without needing to type in the pin. There is a front and back camera that will record at at least 720p. I would not really record an event with the camera however it is nice to know you have that option. The microphone also is very clear and I have not had any issues with any sound issues. It usually does not pick up surrounding noise and focuses more on voice. On the tablet itself, there is a 3.5 port to plug in headphones/microphone. It does have dual band wifi built in and no issues with speed.\n\nThe tablet itself can last about six to eight hours on its own and an additional eight or so hours plugged into the dock. The overall charge time depends but it can take up to a full night to charge both the tablet and the dock to 100% from what I can tell. Normally a full night will last me until dinner time the next day which is pretty good, but you can probably shave the time off with adjusting brightness. One minor complaint about this product is that it arrives 100% battery drained. So if you have this device and it does not power on then just leave it plugged in for 30 minutes to an hour and try again. It has a really fast boot up being less than ten seconds to boot up and it can be set to automatically scan and detect your fast to unlock. There is 8 gb of ram which is pretty standard for most laptops nowadays that work well with most of the application. There is really no lag between application. There is also plenty of storage space however I would recommend to just use an external hard drive to store pictures and videos as 256 gb will run out pretty fast. It has two USB 3.0 ports on the left side as well as a type c on the left next to the charging port. The transfer speed is quick depending on the usb device you have. There is no usb port on the actual tablet itself unfortunately. The speaker system is pretty loud and the heat from this unit is not bad. It does get warm on the tablet and the keyboard when it is in use but that is normal. The edges of the keyboard are slightly slanted down and there is a magnet on the tablet top and the bottom of the keyboard to secure the book closed. The processor is an i5 which is good enough power for what I need it to do. It can play some games but i would say not at the best quality but it can play some at low settings. The processing speed is really fast and it works really well for what I need. You can connect this to a dock or monitor however you will need a type c to hdmi or a usb 3.0 to hdmi adapter to get the video output. It can handle two screens if you have the right adapter at pretty good resolution. Overall this is a great laptop to have and I would suggest you to get this surface book if you want something that is powerful but still have the tablet option.",

                "review_body": "Right off the bat let me say I really love this Surface Book 2. It's the best laptop I've ever had, and I've had quite a few. It has entirely cured my latent MacBook Pro envy, to the point where some of my coworkers now have Surface Book2 envy. That said, this is only possible because I run Linux on the machine instead of Windows 10, and not without some issues. Allow me to summarize:\n\nThe Good\n========\n1. You can run Linux Ubuntu 19.10 on this machine with nearly full support\n2. Laptop size, weight, screen resolution - all top notch\n3. Carrying this thing around, you will be super cool\n4. Touchpad, touchscreen, detachable screen, wifi, audio, etc. all work great\n5. Battery lasts all day\n6. USB-C port drives monitor and charges laptop battery simultaneously\n\nThe Bad\n========\n1. You must install one specific patched version of the Linux kernel\n2. The built-in camera won't work under Linux\n\nThe Ugly\n========\n1. You need to keep a dual-boot system running Win10, for firmware updates\n2. Bluetooth support is, well, meh\n\nTo clarify, here are some specific observations:\n\nThe Kernel! First of all, this machine only runs Linux as well as it does thanks to the hard work of the guys who put together the \"jakeday surface linux\" repository on Github. Google it, follow the simple instructions, and all will work well. But this patch-set only runs on Linux Kernel version 5.1.15, which is now, i.e. 10NOV2019, somewhat behind the latest Ubuntu 19.10 (5.3.0-19) distribution. Doubtless it will get updated at some point, but as of this writing it hasn't been updated in five months.\n\nUbuntu! You're pretty much stuck with using the Ubuntu distro. Some intrepid hackers have forked the jakeday patches for ArchOS - good luck with that. Or if you prefer jakeday gives instructions for building on any Debian-based system - again, good luck, because the base linux kernel repository no longer goes back to stable version 5.1.15, meh. As a side note, hitherto I was a Linux \"Mint\" user, so the switch to native Ubuntu has been an adventure.\n\nThe camera, blech! Forget it, the patches will not get the camera working. I have a cheap external camera I use for video conferencing when necessary. Someday maybe someone will get this patched, but I wouldn't hold my breath.\n\nBluetooth! It works, don't get me wrong, but it's flaky. Sometimes I have to reload the bluetooth drivers to get devices to work right.\n\nDual boot! If you want to do firmware upgrades you need to keep Windows 10 installed on a partition, as a dual-boot option. No one I've found knows how to update the firmware outside of Win10. This wastes about 50GB of the precious 250GB SSD drive space.\n\nFast, fast, fast! Geekbench4 clocks this thing at 4662 single-core and 11449 multi-core. It's the fastest machine in my office, running our Cypress test suite half again faster than anyone else. I'll post the geekbench4 link in a comment.\n\nWifi, touchpad, touchscreen, detachable screen, wifi, audio, sdcard, USB-C dock! All that stuff works great. Touch-Ubuntu is fun to play with, but to be honest I never use it. I'm more of a full-stack software engineer than a casual note-taker.\n\nUSB-C Docking Bay! One Single-Cable Connection! I use the SB2 to drive a gorgeous 38\" ultra wide Dell monitor at 3840x1600 resolution. This is with the simple Intel video chipset and not the special Nvidia version. At the same time the SB2 is driving the Dell monitor through the USB-C port, the Dell monitor is charging the SB2 battery through the same cable. This means all I have to do is set my laptop down on my desk, attach one single USB-C cable, and I'm done. All connected, no power, no nothing else. One wire. The Holy Grail has finally been attained - this is the setup they'll hand out at orientation in Heaven.\n\nRetinal Display! The resolution of the internal laptop display is 3240x2160. The Intel chip can drive it simultaneously with my external 3840x1600 display, as a dual-monitor setup. This works fine, but unless you have a magnifying-glass vision you'll want to configure Ubuntu to drive the laptop display at a scaling level of 150% or higher. This is a simple button-click GUI operation, so no worries.\n\ntldr; get this laptop, set it up for dual-boot to Ubuntu 19.10 running the \"jakeday surface linux\" kernel. Apart from the camera everything will work, and you'll be the envy of all your friends.",

                "review_body": "Disclaimer: I walked away from Windows years ago and jumped to the Mac world. This is my first venture back.\n\nCosmetically, it's a good looking unit. Built sturdy. Seems durable. The screen is big and bright and appears to be very sharp when viewing photos or videos. And the thing seems quite fast. Web pages load quickly (I did testing without the built in apps so I used Chrome and other third party software) and overall setup was pretty easy. Although I've been away from Windows for almost eight years the environment hasn't changed that much and I was pretty much at home pretty quickly. I even found my way out to DOS (you remember DOS, right?) without any issues.\n\nBut I really don't like the keyboard. I do a lot of writing that ranges from the typical email to editing a non-profit's monthly newsletter and everything in between. I tried to like this keyboard. I couldn't. Things just seemed to be just slightly in the wrong place. I don't think I'd enjoy working on this one for any length of time.\n\nThe big feature of this device seems to be the screen that detaches and can serve as a tablet. I can see where that would come in handy since I use my iPod for things like client demos and when I head out to hang in coffee shops. I'm not sure I'd do that with this screen. First, it's a bit large and ungainly. While the size is nice for those of us with aging eyes, it just doesn't seem comfortable in my hand and I have the overwhelming fear that I'm going to drop the thing. But that's not my biggest issue with it. All of the ports are on the keyboard. I couldn't, as an example, take this with me to a meeting and charge it if the meeting ran long. If I was going away for a weekend I'd need to take the whole kit with me. If you're looking for the convenience of a tablet this might not fit the bill.\n\nSo I'm still playing with it. I picked it up because I still have friends and relatives using Windows and I've been out of practice when it comes to answering their questions. I thought it might be fun to test the waters after all these years. It was amusing, but maybe not fun. If you can get your hands on one for testing I'd make a strong suggestion that you do that before you commit to making this your main machine.",

                "review_body": "We have a number of surface tablets in our house, and this was my first surface book. I got it hoping for some increased performance for using with my landscape CAD program, and I did notice a difference in the smoothness when working with CAD on this device as opposed to my other comparable surface tablets. The better performance only works when it is hooked up to the keyboard, which is fine for CAD work.\n\nI also like to use this as a tablet for photo editing work related to my business, and here I noticed my number one complaint about this device, which is that the tablet part itself does not have the little foldout stand that all of the other surface tablets have. I guess they think that you will just connect it to the keyboard, but sometimes I want it to be as flexible and lightweight as a regular surface Pro tablet, and while you can unhook it from the keyboard and use it as a tablet, it feels more bulky and the lack of stand makes it less flexible in its use than the surface Pro tablets.\n\nOne thing I did notice is that you can connect it to the keyboard backwards and use the keyboard as a stand that way, however that does not bend to the same angle as the tablet stands do on a regular surface Pro.\n\nI also think that the battery life is a lot less on this one than on the surface Pro tablets. Even when not connected to the keyboard and the increased computing performance that you get from that, it seems to wear down its batteries on tablet mode in about 30 to 45 minutes of photo editing. When I worked on my surface tablet in this fashion, I feel like I got a little less than two hours before having to recharge.\n\nOverall, if you plan to use this primarily plugged in as a laptop and only occasionally as a tablet, the increased performance from the attached keyboard make this a worthwhile choice if you do gaming or more high-powered computing. However, if you are primarily using it as a tablet or in places where battery life is a critical consideration, I would suggest the regular surface Pro tablet instead.\n\nIn terms of accessories, I use the surface pen constantly, but haven't reached for the other accessories much at all. The surface pen makes it so smooth to make notes on photographs to convey ideas to people, and is great for photo editing.",

                "review_body": "I thought this was a great idea at first.  It updates when it wants to.  It downloads gigabytes for each download stealing your hard drive space.  It seems like every time I have an important job to do in a hurry this thing is automatically updating.  I made modifications in the code to stop updates well they updated and removed my modifications.  It is also a spy machine.  It uploads everything to Microsoft.  Why do they want my kids pictures all of my files it sends an image of the entire operating system.  I do my taxes on it and fill out PDFs with private information it just uploads everything and you cannot stop it.  I even tried putting this thing on airplane mode so it can stop downloading gigs worth of updates.  That does not work.  The thing will slow down what I\u2019m doing so it can download gigs worth of information as well as upload gigs of info.  This is crazy. This is the worst investment ever.  If they are going to rely on my information to make money why isn\u2019t this thing free?  So u charge me 2 grand for the thing to spy on me then you make even more money with my info.  Stay away.  Also it downloads stuff On it\u2019s own my desktop always has some new game some new program they want me to try.  Why are they downloading stuff in my computer.  The privacy policy is tricky and I studied law.  It links you to places with broken links.  It wants you to login and the information is in so many different websites it\u2019s ridiculous.  If I could get my money back I would.  It also has a tablet mode that is useless.  You go in tablet mode and everything disappears? What? It could have been alright if it never had windows 10 and their spyware. If you buy this make sure you get the one that has a huge hard drive and get huge SD cards.  The updates will eat up all your space mine is full am using it because I had an extra sd card good luck giving away your privacy to someone who is selling it.",

                "review_body": "Overall: The newest surface is a phenomenal product and it keeps improving every year. The screen quality is truly impressive and this is a tablet/laptop is a generous size to easily accomplish goals and multi-task. The computer is very fast and easily processes your multi-tasking. There are a few minor things that made it slightly less enjoyable but these did not detract much from my enjoyment of the system. The computer is really a powerhouse or beast of a system and replaces the need to have both a laptop and a tablet. This makes it a very convenient choice for professionals because it showcases presentations but can also be used personally.\n\nPros: The screen is absolutely gorgeous and that is one of the best features. It is perfect for streaming movies/TV shows, checking emails, playing games, etc.  It is also easy to switch into work mode and get a lot accomplished on Microsoft Office products / Adobe / Internet (Chrome).  It runs multiple applications very well with it\u2019s 16 GB memory and has a lightning-fast processor for most basic tasks of the common user.  Even when doing a lot of processing, the computer runs quiet and does not run hot which are important features. It\u2019s fairly easy to switch between tablet and laptop mode just by clicking it in and out.  There is a button that shows the eject on the keyboard.  You will then be prompted on whether or not you would like it to be in tablet mode or stay in tablet mode. Another amazing advantage is the battery life. It easily lasts twice as long as a standard laptop and I\u2019ve gotten very long life spans out of it as it easily makes it past 15 hours.\n\nCons: One strange thing that I noticed is that when the battery is low, it will not allow me to detach the tablet from the keyboard.  This is unusual because I can charge it either on the keyboard or on the tablet directly. It\u2019s surprisingly heavy for a tablet, due to it packing a lot of processing power.  It is noticeably harder to manipulate in the hand compared to more standard tablets when using it in tablet mode. Also, while the product page shows some of the connected devices like the pen, wireless mouse, etc. it does not come with any of those so they must be ordered separately. It only arrives with the keyboard stand.  Another aspect that I have noticed is that on occasion it glitches in tablet mode and the keyboard does not pop up when I am filling out forms or attempting to type.\nBottom Line-  It is a wonderful choice and you really are getting the definition of versatile.",

                "review_body": "Let me start off by stating this is not your typical Surface.  The Microsoft Surface is a tablet, which may or may not include with it some sort of soft felt/leathery keyboard connected to the tablet via bluetooth.  The tablet also has a kick stand that helps it stay upright.\n\nThe Surface Book is a laptop.  It opens/closes and feels like your typical laptop.  But it's not your typical laptop.  With the touch of a button, the Tablet screen detaches from the solid, back-lit keyboard.\n\nHow does this work?  The connection is maintained by what feels like two electromagnetic tabs which embed into the Tablet screen about 10-15mm.  There are also 3 multi-pin connections which I suspect provide power, video, and USB connection to/from the keyboard section.  These are all hidden when the Tablet is docked to the keyboard.  The keyboard section provides the Tablet with a second battery, two 'standard' USB 2.0 ports, one SD Card Slot, one USB Type-C slot and a power slot.\nHere's a few random notes on the keyboard: the keyboard section feels like it actually weighs more than the Tablet when separated.  The button to release the Tablet looks like a standard key on the keyboard, next to the Del key, above the backspace.  The hinge is also unique in that it's like a C-shape.  The laptop won't close at a perfectly straight angle like most laptops.  Despite this fact, there don't seem to be any weak points in the hinge.  I personally would think that the weak points are the shallow tabs that connect the keyboard and Tablet together.  They don't seem big enough to withstand a whole lot of tug/pull, so I am careful not to handle it too rough.\n\nThe Tablet is amazing.  When detached from the keyboard, it is lightweight and ultra-responsive.  It responds very well to third-party 'electric' pens that allow me to create hand-drawn designs just as if it were pencil/paper.  However, there are a couple of notes to this design:\nThere is a single port on the tablet.  However, instead of going with the industry standard USB Type-C connection, Microsoft decided to go with its own weird connection.  It is the same connection which is used to provide power to the Keyboard.  Thus, the same power cable used to power/charge the Keyboard also charges/powers the Tablet.  I also read that there are data cables that convert this weird connection to USB Type-C, which theoretically could provide data transfer ability AND power straight to/from the Tablet (without the Keyboard).  However, I don't know if the port on the Tablet will allow video/data to go in/out without the Keyboard attached.  The cable descriptions state \"Doesn't support data transfer or video output, only be used for charging your Surface.\"  You can search \"Surface Connect to USB-C Charging Cable\" on Amazon if you are curious.\n\nDespite its few drawbacks, as long as you view this as a laptop that turns into a Tablet instead of a Tablet which turns into a laptop, you won't be disappointed.",

                "review_body": "The Surface Book 2 with an i5 8250U processor is the third Surface Book I've owned. I had an original i7 with a dGPU, a Surface Book 2 i7 with a dGPU, and now this i5 8250U without a dGPU. (If you're curious, I returned the SB2 i7 because the screen weight made it too wobbly.)\n\nThe first thing I noticed after installing all of the patches available, was how zippy the system was. I've stuck with i7 CPU's for the past few years, because you can \"feel\" how slow the i5's are by comparison. In this iteration of the Surface Book 2, the i5 8250U mostly (MOSTLY!) seems to give the i7 8650U in my ThinkPad Yoga X1 a run for its money.\n\nOnce you really start to put it through its paces, you'll start to notice that it isn't quite a modern i7. But to that end, I'm talking about moving large projects back and forth in Photoshop and Lightroom, or rendering video. For the vast majority of average use, you probably wouldn't notice the difference between the two processors -- except the Surface Book 2 doesn't give you the same kind of fan noise you'd get on a ThinkPad Yoga with an i7.\n\nAs for the rest of the system, it's just about everything you've probably read about Surface Books. The display is gorgeous, and has a wonderful aspect ratio for getting things done. When it comes to 15\" laptops, I can't think of a single one where I'd say the display is universally better than what you'll get in a Surface Book 2.\n\nSimilarly, the Surface Book 2 offers some of the cleanest sound I've experienced in a non-gaming laptop, and despite what ThinkPad purists may say, the keyboard is as good or better than just about any ThinkPad Lenovo has made in the past 4 - 5 years.  (Oh, W520... how I miss your awe-inspiring keyboard...) And of course, you get all the benefits of a display than can be detached and / or flipped, though I think the 15\" model is a bit big for using as a tablet for extended use. Pair it up with a Surface Pen (or Wacom Bamboo Ink, if money's really tight) and you've got a lovely setup for art, sketching, and document markup.\n\nIt's a lovely machine, but I wouldn't buy it. And here's why:\n\nAs of summer 2019 when I'm writing this, this specific i5 model is kind of like a Surface Book 2.5, since it was recently updated. Yet, Microsoft still hasn't quite figured out how to make the hinge stronger or display lighter, such that it doesn't wobble incessantly if you're a... \"spirited\" typist. Frankly, I was disappointed to see that this hadn't been addressed, as it's been a known problem for going on two years.\n\nSecond, unless you absolutely must have a detachable screen and can't come up with the money for a dGPU model, this is a pretty awful value. You could save tons of money on a Surface Laptop 2, if you're just using this as a laptop and don't have very specific criteria.\n\nThird, holy wow, is this heavy. I hadn't realized how spoiled I was with my ThinkPad Yoga X1, or even my regular Surface Pro 5. You're almost certainly going to want / need a decent laptop bag for this, which is probably going to annoy anyone who hasn't moved towards laptop folios for going back and forth between home and work / school.\n\nSo, it's not that this is a bad laptop. It definitely isn't. But unless you have a perfect combination of needs and available cash that has you looking at the i5 without dGPU, I'd either put more money toward a dGPU model, or consider a different model like the Surface Laptop 2, Surface Pro with a keyboard cover, or a convertible like the Lenovo X1 Yoga or Dell XPS 2-in-1 series.",

                "review_body": "This is a hybrid computer that can be used as a laptop or a tablet. The external dimensions of the computer are 13.5\u201dx10\u201dx1\u201d; the device weighs 3.8 lbs. Actual screen dimensions are 12.5\u201dx8.5\u201d. The keyboard has a standard Windows layout with no numeric keypad. Below the keyboard is a touchpad. The screen can be detached from the keyboard and used as a tablet since it is a touchscreen. The battery is integrated with the screen and is not removable. The battery takes a complete charge in a few hours and is rated to last up to 17 hours. On the left edge of the keyboard are 2 USB A ports and an SD card slot. On the right edge are 1 USB C port and a charging port. Power and volume buttons are on the top edge of screen. There is a front camera with microphone at the front center of the screen and a rear camera in the top corner. The computer comes with a charging transformer and cable; all other accessories like a stylus are sold separately.\n\nThe processor is an Intel i5-8350U running at 1.7Gh. The device comes with 16 Gb RAM installed. The hard drive is solid state with 238 Gb of useable space. Both the screen and keyboard are sealed, so the memory and hard drives cannot be upgraded or replaced after purchase.\n\nI am very pleased with how this device works for portable computing. It boots up quickly, the keyboard is smooth and easy to type on, and the ability to detach the screen and use it as a large format tablet is really slick. The screen has a very clear display, and the touchscreen is quite responsive. Unlike many other laptops that I have tried, the 16 Gb of installed RAM means Windows and applications run quite well without getting bogged down. The SSD hard drive is also much faster than you would get with a mechanical drive. On the other hand, the Intel i5-8350U processor is not screaming fast, so this is no high-powered gaming machine. Still, for most professional office or student purposes, this computer will do just fine. The 238 Gb hard drive is big enough for creating and storing office documents. But if you do media-heavy creative work (like serious photography), you would probably want to store your media on an external drive rather than the small drive that comes with this machine. The computer comes preloaded with Win10 and Microsoft Edge (browser). If you want to use other Microsoft software (like Office, Word, Excel, Powerpoint, etc) on this computer, you either need to purchase a subscription or purchase the software outright. (There is no optical drive on this computer, but you can connect an external optical drive, sold separately, if you wish).\n\nThe only design issue that I have found with this device is the location of the ports. I find an external mouse much more comfortable to use than a touchpad. But the USB A ports on this device are both on the left side. So my right-handed mouse cord has to snake around the back of the machine. Meanwhile, my external hard drive has a USB C cable, so it needs to get connected to the right side of the machine, where it gets tangled up with the mouse cable. If only the USB C port was on the left and there was a USB A port on the right. Or\u2026if the ports had just been on opposite sides, with USB C and charging on the left, and USB A and SD card on the right, cabling would have been so much simpler!\n\nThese minor design quibbles aside, this device is excellent for mobile computing. The battery seems to last forever\u2014all day and the next as well. The screen is beautiful, and the computer has enough RAM to support Windows 10 running multiple applications at once.",

                "review_body": "I want to point out the difference!  Because, not long ago, detaching the screen or monitor from your computer or laptop meant that the screen or monitor turned into a tablet that only worked with apps.  That is NOT what's going on here!  I'd guess that this is not news to most who have grown up with the latest and greatest in technology.  But for others, who are more isolated from what's new, this might cause some confusion.\n\nI got this Surface Book--a laptop with a detachable screen--because I wanted to run Corel software on the detached screen.  Programs such as Painter, PaintShop, CorelDraw and more, install, load and run smoothly on this Surface Book.  Removed from the base with the keyboard, I can draw right on my lap, or flat on a table.  Turn the screen around, attached but facing away from the keyboard, I can draw on an angle, on a slight incline.  I can use the Surface pen with my Corel programs, too.\n\nWhile I fully appreciate, and am somewhat in awe of, the fact that sophisticated, large and intricate programs run quickly and smoothly on this screen--apart from its mother board--I have noticed just two things that prevent me from awarding this a 5-star rating:\n--It runs hot.  While I want to hold it on my lap, the heat makes it uncomfortable to do so.  The heat is distracting, too.\n--The screen does not hold its position firmly.  Put a bit of pressure on the screen and you'll lose your angle.\n\nThe touch screen is sensitive.  I suppose that is both a positive and a negative.  The Surface Pen does not come included, but it is a worthwhile--almost necessary add-on.  So, for the price point of this Surface Book, I'd think they could include it in the package.  The pen is magnetized and will attach itself to the Book, but I don't ever count on it staying in place.\n\nBattery life is good.  I do appreciate the magnetized \"plug-in\" to the base.\n\nScreen color is bright and sharp.  No complaints there.  It provides pretty, pretty visuals.\n\nI hate the Microsoft eye recognition.  Sometimes I wear glasses, sometimes I don't.  If you want to utilize the eye recognition feature, make sure your glasses are either always on or always off.  I'm glad to say that you don't need to use the eye recognition if you don't want to--it is a preference that you can turn off.  But logging into Microsoft, which is a choice on other makes of computers and laptops, is not a choice here.  You must have a log-in or a Pin to gain access to your Book.",

                "review_body": "Being a generous person, I let my partner try out the new Surface Book that arrived at our house. Here's his review. He's\n\nAbout a year ago I decided to switch from Mac to Windows for my work computer needs. I started with a generic (but attractive) ultrabook, then acquired a Microsoft Surface Go to reduce weight. Even though it's underpowered, I found the Surface Go's hybrid (laptop/tablet) usage model really attractive. I got a Surface Pen, and experimented with using the Go as a regular tablet, replacing my Android tablet. [Note: not this device]\n\nAnd then I had the opportunity to use a Surface Book 2, which I'm now reviewing. 15 inch model, Core i5 (so no discrete GPU), 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD, 3000x2000 touch screen. So what's it like?\n\nFirst, it's heavy. Three and a half pounds, heavier than any laptop I've used for the last 6 years. Which means that it's not going to replace the Surface Go, it's going to spend most of its time on my desk. That's fine; I know that I'm still waiting for the perfect device.*\n\nSecond, the screen is gorgeous. Color gamut and brightness are superb, touch registration is unmatched. My previous benchmark was the Huawei MateBook X Pro, and the Surface Book 2 beats it handily (albeit subjectively).\n\nThird, Windows Hello (face-based login) is blindingly fast. I was used to this feature from the Surface Go and my OnePlus 6T phone, but it's almost instantaneous on the Surface Book 2.\n\nFourth, the build quality is as good as it gets. Which means that it overshadows the latest from Apple, and it's about the same as the Huawei MateBook X Pro. (And NO MORE BUTTERFLY KEYBOARD!!!)\n\nAll of the reviews that I've seen have divided the intended audience for the Surface Book 2 into two. The professionals will pay a crazy price to get the Core i7 with the GTX 1060 and 1TB, and they'll have a portable video editing powerhouse with over 12 hours of battery life. The artists won't be able to afford all that, but they'll get the entry-level Surface Book 2 because of the ability to unplug the screen and use it as a tablet with the Surface Pen.\n\nThe configuration that I got is aimed at the second group, and I'm not really an artist. So I don't really fit the target audience, and all I can do is to review the unit as a well-built, slightly over-weight business laptop. And It fits that use case surprisingly well. The screen fits nicely just below the big curved monitor on my desk; I run all of my productivity tools on the Surface Book screen, and do my real work on the external monitor. Once or twice a week I flip the screen around into what Microsoft calls \"Studio Mode\", and use the Pen to sketch software architecture diagrams.  The lag is not perfect, but it's acceptable.\n\nOverall, I like it. Great screen, nicely balanced keyboard, decent performance, great usability, excellent battery life.\n--\n* Speaking of perfect, if Microsoft would put a decent processor into a Surface Go, bump the RAM to 16GB, and include the LTE modem, while keeping the weight under a pound and a half, they can come and take my money right now.",

                "review_body": "So far, I'm very happy with this laptop. Bought the Surface Book because the detachable keyboard allows me to read magazines and graphic novels in portrait mode as a large tablet (via Kindle app), and they render in vibrant colors. The laptop mode (w/keyboard attached) works just fine. Note that it's a bit heavy for the size, but I think this is due to the 2nd/helper battery in the keyboard. The extra weight doesn't bother me at all, but might bother someone shopping for more of an ultrabook class (I got the 15\" model; maybe the 13\" is a lot lighter). All said, I'm very happy with this purchase so far.",

(Just pushing on the toggle button without pushing in the drive doesn't work at all.)  Fortunately, I don't have to use the CD/DVD drive very often.  I don't do gaming on this computer; just basic business application stuff. However, I do have a lot of applications open at once, and the amount of RAM seems sufficient for this: the speed/performance is fine.  I am pleased that the touchpad includes separate buttons for left and right click (a previous version of HP computer tried to combine this into the touchpad and it was extremely frustrating and difficult to use).

It ran quickly, booted fast, ran the games that I needed it to, took the notes that I needed, the whole nine. It was perfect for what I was doing as a college student. I had it for eight total months before it started to get louder. Then nine before I started receiving messages that the fan was malfunctioning. I took it to my school's IT place and they said it looked like a screw was missing that was holding the fan in place. I don't know anything about it or if the screw was even there since I'm too scared to open up my own laptop. I don't know how to do this stuff and I wasn't going to mess it up more. They cleaned the fan, but they couldn't fix the loud clicking and whirring noise coming from the fan. Now a little further down the line almost 1 year and it's shutting down randomly, taking forever to start up, freezing, won't stay on if it's not connected to a power source, and the clicking is constant and makes it difficult to use the laptop. I can't even take it with me to class anymore to take notes because of it. I won't say not to buy it, because I loved my laptop in the beginning, but be warned that, even brand new, you're probably going to have to replace it within a year or two. However, if you don't just have 600 dollars to burn on a laptop, then pick something else or invest in the warranty. You're going to need it.",

This laptop will last a couple hours on battery with light use. The bloatware affects performance slightly, I will likely do a clean install at some point, but its not a major issue.  Now, I don't know why hyper threading is disabled in BIOS OOTB but it is, and I noticed right away when MEmu would not load a single instance, yet once hyper threading was enabled, started right up. Maybe hyper threading is disabled for the same reason the go carts at the theme park are throttled: so nobody gets hurt. Maybe enabling hyper threading will make your laptop melt or light on fire (doubtful). Either way, mine has hyper threading enabled (in BIOS) and it is a fairly ambitious multitask er for any average user. In the 450-550 price range, this feels looks a good deal, on paper.  remember, only 3 USB ports 1 reg 2 SS, no USB C no touchscreen, it comes with a disc drive that MAY come in handy. The laptop does not open fully flat, so be careful. SO, enable hyper threading in BIOS (at your own risk) as in my case I would have been 100% a dissatisfied customer if this laptop couldn't run multiple instances of MEmu to a greater degree than the aging i3  I still use everyday. So don't complain it is slow until you try a clean install with hyper threading enabled. Oh, and the screen is, a laptop screen, i guess. (I assume HDMI out works fine)  its all white washed out compared to my PC monitor. I guess that's how laptop screens all are. I assume. Don't forget to disable all the \"occasionally show tips\"  settings in Windows 10 to bring the process usage below 100% when doing nothing (long unfixed Windows 10 bug). When properly configured, this is a fast laptop in the i5 8th Gen arena. So Far So Good",

At a nearly 4k price point with an insurance plan I expected it to be better. It constantly runs at high temps when utilizing the gpu but still functions. The high temps have caused an aesthetic hinge cover to come loose, but still functional, the 4k screen seems to be slowly warping upwards on that side because of it. The battery life with the 4k screen is longer than normal but that still isn't a lot of time away from a charger. The main concern is the lower casing, its too flexible and when showing work to others the touchpad isn't consistently useable due to physical  issues with the bottom housing flexing from its own weight. The whole housing should have been metal and even with the 810g rating, a dent in that bottom case could keep the touchpad from working forever. Repairing the hinge when contacting msi is understandably an out of warranty repair. At its price point  and considering you are paying the 1200$ premium over a gaming laptop with similar hardware specs, the build quality should have been higher.",

                "review_body": "I work at a public middle school, I am also a Linux enthusiast. After playing around with the Chromebooks the school district bought for the students to use during  class, I became really interested in this platform. When I read that the Chrome OS now supports not only Android apps, but Linux apps I decided that I was going to buy a Chromebook.\n\nOverall, this Chromebook works well and I am very pleased. Granted, I did use some Amazon points and a gift card I had received for Christmas so the out of pocket price was significantly lower than the $500+ HP was selling the machine for. In other words, I may not have been so happy had I paid list price.\n\nThe Good:\n1. The machine looks cool and feels very sturdy.\n\n2. The 64 gigs of hard drive space (not counting the 20 or so gigs taken up by the OS) are aqueduct - most mobile apps are fairly small. Some Linux apps can be a bit large, but provided one does not go wild installing apps the provided hard drive space should suffice.\n\n3. On a related note, Google does give you 100 gigs of storage free for one year. Additionally, I was able to mount my NAS in less time than it took me to write this sentence. So, at least at home, I have more space than I will need to store files.\n\n4. The Chrome OS found my networked HP printer and setting the printer up on the Chromebook was very easy.\n\n5. I don't use Gmail, but Chrome allowed me to \"install\" a web app to my email provider's web interface which works pretty well. Personally, I would rather use a stand alone email app. Using flatpak I was able to set up Evolution. Unfortunately,  I was not able to get Evolution to save my password - retyping the password each and every time I wanted to check mail may be a good security measure, but it gets on my nerves at home so I attempted to install Thunderbird. I received an error that I need a newer version of flatpak to run Thunderbird. The command line option to update flatpak returns the notice that no update is available. I settled on Claws mail which works well. I should make clear that these limitations have nothing to do with this particular machine, but seem to represent the state of the OS and Linux integration at the moment.\n\nThe Not So Good:\n1. While back-lit, the silver color of the letters on the keyboard make viewing the letters extremely difficult. This would not be a problem were the keyboard to mirror most other laptop keyboards I have used. Something is different and I can't quite put my finger on the problem. What I do notice is that on my desktop PC and my Linux laptop I can type without looking at the keyboard. I consistently hit the wrong keys on the Chromebook.\n\n2. The screen has a lot of glare.\n\n3. The speakers work fairly well when the Chromebook is in the position of a traditional laptop. When you fold the screen over to make a tent for viewing a video, the speaker sound becomes muffled due to the speakers being blocked by the screen. Ear buds solve the problem.\n\nStill, overall, the Chromebook works very well and feels solid. The more I use Google's OS the more convinced I am that this is the future for non-gamers.",

At just over $400 its tough to beat. The Asus C434 Flip is arguably a better Chromebook but costs $100 more for the same specs. The X360 is really great value.\n\nEither of these two Chromebooks will meet most peoples needs with a solid aluminium build quality, convertible into a tablet. This X360 Chromebook runs the Android Play Store apps well which is what I got it for to be able to run Skype, which it does flawlessly.\n\nThe Chromebook does support the new Google Assistant, not that I use it much. I'll talk to a dedicated device, not so much to my laptop/tablet. I'm using Amazon Echo throughout the home so I suppose that's why I don't use the Google Assistant very much.\n\nSo glad HP went with a USB-C charging cable. HP sensibly put regular USB ports on the device as well. As with most laptops now, no HDMI port, so to connect to an external device you'll need a dongle. The charging cable is a standard laptop brick, shame they didn't go with a travel charger.\n\nThe lettering on the keys is fairly light with low contrast which at certain angles can make it difficult to see which key is which. The back-lighting works well.",

I let it fully charge for hours and for some reason it still won't turn on I don't really know why. It's a shame because the look of it is super cool.\n\nThe pros about this is it has a very decent specs inside, the metal is super high end looking. Just opening the lid up is just it's a really nice experience. The keyboard is not bad I personally prefer the number pads on the side but this is a smaller laptop and there's really no room for it. I feel like they put a lot of effort to make the entire experience nice but for some reason it won't turn on and I don't know why. I'm hoping that it's only me that has this issue because it looks so cool.\n\nI personally am a big fan of name brand laptops so I honestly was trying to give this a try hopefully I can figure out what's wrong and get it working but for now it doesn't turn on at all. I charged it overnight same issue it just won't turn on.",

Upgraded to Windows 11 with no problem.  However, there are a few things to note:  1) the price has gone up about $100 in two months, 2) you cannot upgrade the RAM, 3) there is no hdmi port, 4) there is no SD card reader, and 5) there is no ethernet port.  I have not actually taken the back panel off and looked, but it is my understanding that the RAM is not upgradable on Acer Swift 3's.  I am using a USB-C hub for an hdmi port, SD card reader, and ethernet port.  With the Thunderbolt 3 port, the right USB-C hub works great.  My hub has hdmi 2.0, so I can run my monitor at 4k @ 60hz.",

The Mic won't work when a headset is plugged into the male/female plug. If you press on the computer casing near the plugin..all of a sudden it will work..but as soon as you release the pressure the mic stops working again. I believe it is an issue created when the company upgrades the memory (as I had them all upgraded). I wouldn't buy from this company either: Oydisen Electronics. Couldn't speak to a live person and even after emailing several times and explaining the issue they just sent me a canned response that addressed none of my concerns.",

You can't put links to websites like I did for him on windows with a good description of each. You can't set it to log on without prompting for a password, which for him is almost a deal breaker. I had to guide him to type his password in if websites forgot it. To do it every time would be murder for him.\n\nThose things I could talk him through, if he never got used to the convenience of windows. But here's what happened the first hour of use to me setting it up for him, checking all things out. In YouTube a video was playing, I was trying to delete some old bookmarks. The whole thing froze, no response, sound of the video was like a broken record. Then after 100 presses of power it did shut off. When back on, no sound. Had to reboot it to get the sound back. This is the first hour, of the first day. Be sure you all know what these are. Limited, clearly less stable than windows. Android, but not Android. I got a launcher, but couldn't link sites to it, or make it my main desktop. Facebook Android app wouldn't load, though in chrome it works fine.

The B&O sound system is nice I guess, hope your are not buying any Chromebook anticipating awesome sound quality.\nThis was purchased to replace an Acer model 720 which I have used for 5 years.  The user interface is nearly identical. My Acer suffered from battery bulging as I left it plugged in all the time. No laptop especially ones with non-replaceable batteries should be left continuously plugged  in to an AC outlet.\nI really like to have a Chromebook around usually use by bedside, also when my Windows desktop is under going a 3 hour update right when I really need to get something done.\nThe  price on this model changes daily I paid  $299 the next day it was selling for 259.

To damn controlling and the forced updates that mess things up and always when i start it up because i don't use it much anymore so i might as well pour a cup of coffee and sit down for a while. Google is questionable as to how android is going, so i figured it would try a cheap chromebook. I do not care for the operating system at all. So stripped down, and everything software side sucks. have to get root access to be able to have reasonable access to file system, mouse support is crappy, and i will stop cause i could go on for awhile. Guess it is good if you only want mail and internet access. Have to hope you can  find an extension or app on the chrome store.\nupdate 12/7/18: i really really don't like Chrome OS. Access to the app drawer is a move your mouse around to get to the drawer with two clicks instead of opening by clicking on the drawer button.  Finding files is a hit and miss deal. I installed a video downloader and only the app finds the files. Does not show in the Chrome file app, nor in the ONLY app for this in the chrome app store. Shouldn't have to go to Play store to find such a common app. Need to root to get access to files and that erases all your data on the chromebook. Updated this morning, and it took about 15 minutes before it would restart. I was freaking out that my new laptop was dead. Some warning upfront that it would take that long would be nice. That is one of the reasons I wanted to get away from Windows, and now it is starting to be the same with Chrome. So unhappy with Alphabet/Google. Maybe i need to start considering Apple.....",

                "review_body": "We've had three different \"budget\" Chromebooks, the Acer C720, Acer Chromebook 14 and this HP Chromebook 14 G5.  Of the three, the C720 has lasted the longest. We have young kids who are hard on the machines and only the C720 lasted.\n\nThis one only lasted one year. The trackpad is caput. It felt sturdy and of similar build quality to the C720 but ultimately it couldn't stand the test of time. Even the Acer 14 seemed to be more fragile despite it's aluminum body but that one we got two solid years of use out of.\n\nI have to say we're disappointed with the longevity of the HP 14 G5. I was hoping it could permanently replace the C720 but it didn't.\n\nIf you don't have young kids who abuse your electronics then this is probably a fine option. It had the juice to run Android apps and we never felt it was underpowered for general web surfing, Google Docs or remoting into a work desktop with Google's remote access tool. I'm sure if it were better cared for it would have lasted much longer.",

                "review_body": "This review is for the NON-touch screen 14-ca040nr.  Reviews get lumped together, so it's good to know which product you're reading about.\n\nI'm a semi-retired IT technician, so this review comes from that standpoint.\n\nIf you're not familiar with the Chrome operating system you may want to do some independent research before purchasing a Chromebook.  While they are designed around Cloud computing (with most data being saved in Google Docs rather than locally), it's quite possible to work with the machine offline.  You can specify in Google Docs that files should be available \"offline\"; a copy of the file is kept locally and syncs back to the Cloud when WiFi becomes available.\n\nGoogle Docs (word processor, spreadsheet, presentation software) all come with your Gmail account and is the \"base\" set of applications used by most folks on a Chromebook.\n\nI've enabled Linux on the HP, and installed LibreOffice - primarily because there's no database application in Google Docs and I do a bit of work in databases.  Linux works very well on the HP for that purpose.\n\nLinux also allows the installation of GIMP, which is a PhotoShop type image editor.\n\n[EDIT 9/30/18 - I should note that Linux documents (such as you may create in LibreOffice) should be kept within the Linux folder structure.  Keeping such files on an SD drive doesn't work - Linux can't \"see\" that drive.  There may be a method to guide Linux to the proper folder.  If I take time to figure that out I'll update the review.  In the interim, plan on using a bit of the 32gb of internal space for LibreOffice docs.  The upside is that, of course, such documents are totally independent of the Cloud, just like they would be on a Windows machine).\n\nI've enabled File System For Windows (another app) which allows me to contact to my Windows 10 Pro machine and transfer files to and from while on the same network.  Chrome RDP allows me to take control of the Windows machine while on the same network and Chrome Remote Desktop allows access to the Windows machine from wherever there is an Internet connection (without direct file transfer - if you need to swap a file, just drop it into Google Drive).\n\nIf you're a DropBox user, you can install File System for DropBox on the Chromebook.\n\nMicrosoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, OneDrive, Outlook, etc. are all available from the Microsoft web applications.  Microsoft Access is not available on the web apps.  There are also Android apps for Microsoft (which I don't use, I use the web apps).  If you have encrypted Word or Excel files the M/S web apps can't open them.  You can install the (free) WPS office suite and it can open password locked Microsoft documents just fine.  If you enable Linux, LibreOffice can also open encrypted Microsoft documents.\n\nSplashtop for Business works using their web app, and from that I can log into remote Windows machines (including  Windows Server 12r2).\n\nAs you can see, quite a bit of work can be done using a Chromebook - it all depends upon your needs and the setup.\n\nThe HP has a decent, but not great, keyboard.  Battery life is excellent.  Be advised - there's no dedicated \"delete\" key or \"caps lock\" key.  You can remap the \"search\" key to emulate a \"caps lock\" key but that affects cursor movement if you're working in Google Docs.  If you haven't used a Chromebook before, Google for how the keyboard works.  Takes a little getting used to, but it's doable.\n\nThere's a micro-SD card slot (I'm using a 32gb card, but it will accept larger cards if need be).  Remember that, while Chromebooks are fairly secure, the card is not encrypted by default.  There are encryption apps available for locking down the SD card.\n\nThe screen (the non-touch version) is O.K.; it doesn't come close to the Pixel screen but it costs only 1/4 as much as a Pixel.\n\nThe charger (included) plugs into either of two USB C ports - one on each side of the machine.  The machine also offers two USB A ports.\n\nThe touch-pad is good - it doesn't get in the way when typing.  However the \"mouse clicks\" on the pad are 'way too hard and loud.  In a library setting it would become annoying very quickly.  Better to use the 'double tap' on the touch-pad rather than click the corners.\n\nThe speakers, for this size of machine in this price range, are excellent.  (I'm not an audiophile, but they sound pretty good to me).  Unlike many lower priced units the speakers are on the Chromebook surface, not underneath or to the sides.  [EDIT 9/30/18 - Using the on board Bluetooth I was able to successfully \"pair\" the HP with an Amazon Echo.  Playing .MP3 files from the SD card using the on board Audio app works fine.]\n\nPrinting is still a bit of an issue with Chromebooks - if you've not used Chromebooks before, do some research on printing lest you be surprised.  Remember that Chromebooks don't accept \".exe\" programs (so you can't load M/S Office from a DVD) and you can't load printer drivers (there are work-arounds but you'll have to look 'em up on your own).  Google Cloud Print is supported.  Still, most printers aren't 'plug 'n play' by simply plugging in a USB cable.  I'm printing to a Samsung, a Kodak 7.1, and an old HP4050n which is hooked up to a Windows 10 machine via Ethernet.  It may take a little more effort than you're used to with \"plug 'n play\" Windows.\n\nThere's no Ethernet port on the machine, but you can get adapters that use the USB C ports and have Ethernet connections.  Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are, of course, supported by default.\n\nThe power switch is above the \"backspace\" key and not likely to be hit accidentally - an improvement over my last Chromebook.\n\nOne note on Cloud storage - Google offers a 100gb \"free\" upgrade for two years (after that if you use more than the 15gb that comes with a Gmail account you have to start paying).  You can Google that - but be aware that if you have multiple Chromebooks (as I do) assigned to one Gmail account, you can't \"stack\" or extend the 100gb offer.  It's 100gb total for each account.  IMHO Google should change their policy on this and, if a new device is purchased for the existing account, the 100gb offer should be extended from the new date of purchase.  YMMV.\n\nYouTube videos seem to play well - I don't play games or watch Netflix on the machine, it's more of a workhorse for me.\n\nOut of the 32gb total internal storage, after Linux and all other apps that I use are installed, I have 18gb free space (not including the SD card).\n\nFit and finish is good (although the machine is basically plastic) and it weighs about 3 pounds (again, the non-touch screen version).  It is, for me, a true \"laptop\" machine in that the bottom doesn't get too hot to hold when it's in my lap.\n\nOverall I'm really pleased with the HP 14-ca040nr.  I've read reviews that say that Chromebooks don't work offline, or don't offer software - and those reviews are wrong.  You just have to set the machine up properly.\n\nHTH\n\nRegards,\n\nJim",

The setup rebuilt all my files and apps, login's and passwords for me. Too easy.  I use it for Gmail, Facebook, maps and news feeds.  Seems to last as long as I need it to daily. I also enjoy reading books on it.  Turned to portrait position, It's just about the size of a book page.  Yu can enlarge the type and it keeps up with where you are.  Nice tool. I split time in tablet mode and keyboard mode.  Touchscreen and mouse pad are fine.",

The Tab s2 9.7 is great at what it is - a Tablet for media consumption, email and web surfing. Don't try to make it what's it not and then hold it against it. Also - the 4:3 aspect ratio on a screen this size really helps make icons pop, and the interface big enough to click.",

Bought a Samsung original charger at Best Buy and that solved the problem.

There is only 1 and it is on the side, not even front facing. I get they did this to reduce bezel and width, but I felt like they could have added at least another speaker on the other side to give more a stereo effect.\n\nOther than that this tablet is great.

Hardware powers through websites and apps without a second thought. The screen is gorgeous, deep colors and crisp blacks. Its difficult to look at my new LG G4 phone after looking at this screen; it just pales in comparison.\n\nBig gripe, though: the battery on this thing... well, it sucks. Its really bad. It will not last more than a 3-4 hours of a lazy afternoon's heavy use (browsing imgur, a video here / there, web browsing). I have to turn it off whenever I'm not using it, otherwise it has to be tethered to it's charger.\n\nLastly, the thumb print scanner is not functional. Not worth the headache of setting it up. It fails no matter how carefully you replicate your initial placement. Would be nice to have an update where it continued to learn your print in the future, to make the scan more efficient.\n\nAll said and done, this is very likely the best Android tablet on the market.... for now. Google's Pixel C tablet comes out soon and I need to figure out a way to swap this Samsung for that new beast.",

So, if I get messages when the sound is off, I don't know that they came in.  It also doesn't seem to have a vibrate setting, so notifications are either muted or noisy.  Having a Galaxy S5 phone, so I expected a USB3 charging port on the tablet, but it just had a regular micro-USB port.  The battery lasts a long time, and I've often charged it over night, so I'm not sure how long it takes to charge, or if having the USB3 port would make it charge faster.  Overall though, it's a great tablet.  I'm very happy with it.  I'd recommend it for sure.",

Watching HD movies is not a bad thing, but you will notice that there is some wasted space. Apps, now when you star your device there are a bunch of choices to pick from. Yes there is pre installed software but most of it was things i was going to use anyways. there are two app stores to chose from but i normally just use the google one. The cameras, while not the best, I find that I dont normal use the cameras for much more than when I am video chatting with friends. I find that I normally use the tablet for a few hours at a time but never have to plug in unless I am going to sleep. I dont have battery issues so i guess I got lucky. The storage is never an issue bc you have the 32 or 64 gig and than you also have the option to add an SD card too.\nAll in all I find myself enjoying my new tablet and turned the slower one into a media device.

I have owned a Nexus 7, Galaxy S5, Galaxy S4, Nexus 5, Nexus 7, iPhone 6, and iPad Air 2.  The Android products are what I choose to use at home and for personal use.\n\nI debated for a long time between getting an Android tablet or a new iPad for my own personal use.  Based on my experience with Android devices, especially Samsung devices, I was concerned that the user experience and operating system would not be smooth.  My Galaxy S5 and S4 both experienced glitches and flaws that would sometimes frustrate me.  But Apple products are just so much more expensive and not easily customizable.  When Black Friday rolled around I was able to snatch up this tablet for $340; if the product turned out to be a dud I could always return it using Amazon's excellent return policy.\n\nI don't know what Samsung did to resolve their issues but this tablet operates very smoothly; much better than my previous experience with their devices.  First there is absolutely no lag when swiping or loading apps; everything transitions smoothly and provides the kind of experience you would expect from an iOS device.  Secondly the device is very thin and extremely appealing; I chose to get the white version.  The battery life is excellent, I watched 6 hours of Netflix and still had plenty of battery life left.  Thirdly it is very customizable which is of course one of the primary reasons users choose Android in the first place.\n\nYou should get this device if you are on the market for a tablet and not obsessed with the idea of owning an Apple device.  I have a hard time imagining a better tablet on the market right now and especially for the price point.",

I have been super happy with this product. I did A LOT of research before finally deciding on The Samsung Gallaxy Tab S2 with a 9.7\" screen and have not been disappointed with the performance of the tablet except for one thing...The charging port. I don't know if I got a defective port, or if this is a weak point for this product, we shall see.\n\nI purchased this tablet about a year prior to the problems with the port. At the same time I purchased the tablet, I did purchase a two year protection plan through Square Trade for $40. Unfortunately, the warranty through Square Trade would not kick in until after the Samsung warranty ran out. I spent a very frustrating morning looking for HELP through Samsung regarding their warranty on the tablet and what to do when something went wrong with it. I found NOTHING. I looked online, made a few phone calls that lead no where. I thought it would be so easy, but it wasn't. Samsung needs to fix this. If you're going to offer a warranty that comes with your product, include information with the product so a customer may follow through with help in the event there is a problem. The information included with the tablet, gave me nothing but dead ends. I called the numbers in the booklet, and the numbers were not up to date and with no help whatsoever to resolve the issue.\n\nMy partner could see my frustration. I wasted time, and energy leading to dead ends, and he suggested I call Amazon for help. I thought there was no way Amazon would be able to help because it was an issue with the warranty through Samsung. NOT TRUE. Not only was my problem SOLVED, but Amazon sent me a REPLACEMENT tablet in TWO DAYS and gave me 30 days to send the tablet with the defective port back!\n\nAMAZON STANDS BY THEIR PRODUCTS. GIVES THE MOST AMAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE SO THE ***CUSTOMER*** IS HAPPY WITH THEIR PURCHASE AND CAN PURCHASE WITH UTTER CONFIDENCE!!!!\n\nI would NOT want to purchase items ANYWHERE ELSE if I can purchase them though AMAZON. I ALWAYS check Amazon FIRST before I purchase ANYTHING. The prices are competitive, the customer service is OUTSTANDING and without a doubt STELLAR!\n\nThank you AMAZON for turning around a very frustrating situation into an experience that ended up being RESOLVED painlessly.

Good battery life, likely to last you all day from average use.  I like the screen, both in output and dimensions though others may crave a 16:9 ratio I like the 4:3 more myself.  I love the expandable memory; just dumped a bunch of movies on there on a 128gb microsd card.  Very responsive performance, no percievable lag or slowdown at any point.  Worth the money.",

I like my iPhone but I played with a couple of android tablets at best buy and decided that was what I wanted for a tablet I use for reading comic books, books, and watching movies.\n\nI bought a Fire HD 10 recently but the screen resolution and os stability was off, stuff worked but not very well.  I ordered this 9.7\" model after playing with a friend's 8.0\" model and it's just impressive.  It's fast, no stutter, the apps work, the screen is beautiful and it's light.  Even with a cover attached, it's still light.\n\nIt was kind of more expensive than I would have liked but I'm using it heavily and it's just great.",

                "review_body": "Before I purchased this tablet, I owned the Tab A 9.7 and loved it, except the lower resolution. Finally, I decided to step up and upgrade to the Tab2 S 9.7 and I am so glad I did as I state the reasons why below:\n\nPROS/SPECIAL FEATURES...\n\n+ Size/Weight/Ease oh holding this S2 9.7 - I had the Tab A 9.7 and before that Tab4 10.1. Both of my old tablets were THICKER and heavier compared to the S2. This tablet is feather light for a 9.7 and more comfortable to hold and to carry in my purse or backpack.\n\nScreen Resolution, Brightness and Other Info \u2013 The resolution on this is 264 ppi compared to 132 ppi (pixels per inch) of Tab A 9.7. This is more than double the resolution. And note that the colors, pictures, videos, everything is so sharp and clear. The screen just pops with color! And I find it easy to read eBooks, watch videos, etc on this tablet. Even at a higher price for this tablet, I find that the tablet has been a wonderful purchase.\n\n* The screen aspect ratio is 4:3 vs the 16:1 type of screen. For me, I like this 4:3 screen because I found that the webpages are easier to read and clearer, I did not have to scroll to the right. Also I found that the pictures on a website were easier to view. I compared this tablet with my older Tab 4 10.1 tablet on my frequent webpages and while I viewed this tablet, I could read the larger text better, read my eBooks much clearer, emails better etc. This is my personal discovery from my testing of this and comparing it to my older tablet.\n\n+ Battery life/Speed \u2013 Good battery life, but not quite as good as my oldercaTab4 or TabA. For me, I have found that I am constantly on WiFi (Internet). One of the reasons is the screen is noticeably brighter (Tab S2 has more brightness nits). So I had to lower the brightness.\nThe tablet I find is quite responsive and peppy with no lagging. The Lollipop 5.1.1 runs this tablet wonderfully.\n\n WiFi Connecting/Speed of WiFi and MORE - This tablet connects SUPER quickly to my home WiFi and has never ever dropped the WIFi signal no matter where I am in my home. WiFi is VERY STRONG at 144mbps, vs 72mbps on my other tablets. Also, my internet loads super, super fast in all browsers that I tried.. And even when I am far from my router I still have 4.5 bars! I went to Settings, pressed on WiFi and it showed speed on my tablets. A,lso, to test this WiFi and compare it to my other Android devices, I went to the Playstore and got the free app called WiFi Analyzer. This is a MUST HAVE app for any Android device as it gives you a visual report on the WiFi strength of your tablet, phone etc.The Wifi speed on my Tab S2 is near double of what my TabA had.\nAlso, there is 32GB Ram in the Tab S2, this is double Ram of Tab A or Tab 4. And this tablet is super fast, no lagging at all!\n\n+ SPECIAL INFO about INTERNET CONNECTION - Yes, this is a WiFi only, but when you are away from an WiFi internet hotspot location, there are ways to can get onto the internet such as MiFi and there are ways that you can purchase equipment so that you can have data when you do not have a WiFi hotspot available.\n\n+ Internet & Webpage & Video Viewing - The stock browser does a wonderful job and it opens up webpages very fast. Also I tried Maxthon Browser and this worked very well yet I still prefer the Internet App. Also, I tried out the factory installed Chrome Browser and liked it OK, yet again, I went back the the stock Internet App (this is my preference). Note that the Playstore has many very good (FREE) internet browsers as Dolphin, Opera and many more!\n\n+ EXTERNAL SLOT FOR MICRO SD CARD/Internal Storage. This is a must for me as I keep my personal files, photos, and music on my internal SD card. I installed a SanDisk 64GB SD card and it works great on this tablet and I placed my music and files on it and have plenty of space left. This tablet accepts up to 128GB SD card.\nThe internal storage of 32GB is double of my Tab A 9.7 or Tab 4 10.1 that have 16GB. Even after Android OS, factory apps, Facebook, Twitter, Kindle App and many more personal that I installed, I still have  just at 23GB of internal storage left!\n\n- + Camera / Video Camera - This has a camera of 8MP with no flash on this camera, however, in good lighting the pictures came out much better had I expected. However, I rarely use this camera as I prefer to use my Nikon digital camera for my overall picture taking...the camera on this tablet is OK for backup camera, taking pictures to send in an email, etc). Do not expect the camera on this tablet to replace your digital camera since it does not have a flash.\n\n+ Home Videos - The stock video player is OK and plays MOST home videos, however, may I suggest QQ Player (Free App from Playstore and the ONLY one I recommend as it plays every home video I tried)..\n\n+ Music Player/Sound Quality - This model has the regular MUSIC App, which plays by playlists, songs, albums and even folders. Also there is Google Music app is pre-installed in this tablet and does a fine job. However, I installed the FREE app called Rocket Player from the Playstore and love this music player! As for sound quality - The best way to really enjoy music is through a high quality Bluetooth speaker or Bluetooth headset as the sound quality is superb this way and you can walk about your home listening to your music!\n\n+ OTG USB Compatible - This tablet comes with a free OTG On the Go adapter cable. Just plug in your flash drive and you can copy files to the flash drive so easily or view files that are on the flash drive. *Note that portable external hard drives and portable DVD/CD drives will not work using OTG in this tablet because they require a lot of power.\n\nCONS:\n-  Battery life is so-so, not the best out there. In fact, I had close to 2 hours less per day on the Tab S2 over the Tab A!  But this is not a deal breaker for me as I still have enough battery time, and I always keep a spare charger in car/purse.\n\n- Cost is pricey compared to Tab A line or the Tab 4 line. The price difference us about 100 dollars more for the Tab S2 9.7, however, for me, I believe that I received a very high end tablet, so it was worth what I paid.\n\nBottom line- Yes, this is a pricey tablet, however, I believe that the old saying that you get what you pay for is true. This is a very high quality tablet.\n\nShould you buy this or the Tab A or a less expensive tablet in my opinion?  While this is an exceptional tablet, I also recommend a couple of others below....\n\nTAB S2 ... Yes you may want to consider the Tab S2 9.7 if you want a higher resolution tablet with larger Internal space, 8MP camera and other high end features and you do not mind paying about 100 dollars more for higher end features etc.\n\nTAB A 9.7... Yes if you want a good tablet for a reasonable price and do not mind lower resolution or 16GB Internal, 5 MP camera, etc, yet this is good because the battery lasted me 2 more hours daily than Tab S2. The TAB A is a wonderful tablet for the money) or Tab 4 10.1, or other lower priced tablet. A 5 MP camera us OK on a tablet for emergency pictures, 16GB Internal is OK if you watch how many apps you install on the internal storage.\nAlso, the Tab A is a GREAT BUY and excellent for someone new to tablets.\n\nIf you have questions, ask me in comments. I am kind of a techie person and will answer promptly.\n\nThank you for reading my review.",

                "review_body": "First: The included charger was very small and the first screen I saw when I turned it on tells me \"You have plugged in a lower wattage power adapter. Your system will continue to work, but may not perform at its peak.\" Really? $700 for a refurb and you cannot even send the proper charger? So I continue with the first boot and choose region and keyboard as usual then am greeted with a screen asking me for my Booking.com email address. What? I do not even know what booking.com is and there is no way to bypass this screen. See attached photos. The first screen informing me of the too small power adapter also had the Dell Service Tag number so I went to Dell to look that up. Turns out this service tag number has Dell ProSupport Plus until 25 September 2024. Wow. That seems too good to be true but I learned the machine needs a 65W adapter and you can see in the last photo the included adpater is only 45W. I might forgive the 45W adapter but I have never had a new Windows 10 machine ask me for my Booking.com email address upon the first boot. I cannot imagine what other surprises would await if I knew how to bypass that screen.\n\nUpdate 9/29/2023: Thank goodness for Dell support. I was able to download and install the factory image from Dell so this laptop now appears to be okay and usable. I have no idea what the refurbish company had put on this machine but it was not a clean windows 10 pro image. HQCapital support has been very responsive (+1star) and is sending the correct charger for this machine.",

Unfortunately, none of the review articles (and certainly not the Samsung site) will let you know that this device will not work with many of the accessories.

I didn't find this out until I had already bought a MHL/micro-USB to HDMI connection and tried to get it to work. Don't bother, it wont. If you want to attempt to connect this device to a television, there is no good way that I can think of. Apparently the 8 and 10.1 models have this capability. Nothing on the Amazon or Samsung websites point out this discrepancy. Even the older (Tab 2 models) can be connected via a dock, not the Tab 3 7-inch though. Returning my 7 inch tablet as a result.",

It was sticking \"on\" sometimes, causing the device to randomly reboot.\n\nIt's working better now.  As for quality, it's ok now but not in the same league as the other galaxy devices.

By the day after Christmas one of them was already completely out of internal memory after downloading less than 20 apps / games.  That is because over 4gb is used for the OS and other bloatware that cant be removed.  So that leaves less than 4 gb left for apps, photos, videos, etc which goes pretty fast.  My sone had 1 game that was taking up over 1Gb. Now, I thought the external SD card would solve our issue so I went out and got a 16gb card.  That's when I found out Samsung disables the option to install / move apps onto the external SD card. It's only for photos and video which doesn't help the apps problem. So 2 days after turning it on for the first time, we're already into deleting apps to make space mode. Given the price, there are other tablets that offer a better value in my opinion.\n\nOverall a decent tablet otherwise. I would rate higher if Samsung would remove the restriction on putting apps on the SD card.  Other vendors android based tablets allow this.",

Normally I would unplug it around 11am and won't plug it back in until 4-6am , with extensive use.\n\nSkype does run the battery down a bit.\nSo far the power saver feature causes freezing with facebook messenger and skype.\n\nIt's great for spanish lessons and bookclub reading\n\nJust brought my mum one for my birthday yesterday this way she could watch her favorite shows on the go.\nNo real problems, other than memory but that is a simple fix. Microsd cards go on sale around back to school deals.\n\nTry it out and see for yourself, it's a great tab for a great price.\n\np.s. you can control the font size so there's no true \"size\" problem.",

The problem noted below (Linux/USB Mass storage) turns out to be Android 4.x related, not just Samsung.  Newer Linuxes have MTP drivers that make it useable, at least in Nautilus.  Based on all this, rating upgraded.\n\nOLDER:\nI have not used the tablet yet.  But I found this out when I went to copy files:  LINUX Users beware - you cannot connect this to your Linux machine and transfer files!  The phone has Windows-only drivers on it, so you can (usually) connect it to Windows and transfer files.  Extra software is required on a Mac.  Stock Android does USB mass storage by default in my experience.  I am seriously disappointed, though I will probably end up keeping it, as I have promised it to someone for Christmas and I don't have time to do a swap.",

Quite often when I am online on this tablet all of a sudden I won't be able to bring a site up, it says unavailable check your network connection and I look and it says I am connected. I have to shut the wifi off and then put it back on again so it will recognize that it is connected and then I can continue what I was doing. I can't understand why it does this but it is not that big of a deal overall it is a great tablet the same as the Tab 2 was.

The features have been cool and have been as described thus far, however, I did note that when this tablet was compared amongst its larger versions (the 8.0 and the 10.1), the box that lists that it has the multi-window feature, was left blank. I'm not sure if that's true for every 7.0 model, but the one I received does indeed have the multi-window feature. Both cameras take pretty decent pictures. Only one little weird design with the tablet: the volume buttons do not operate in the manner you'd expect them to; to turn the volume up, you'll have to press the conventional 'down' side of the button and vice versa.\nOverall, I'm pleased with the tablet and will be posting pictures if I can.",

The 3G model is a real phone and has a Micro Sim card slot in it. For just about 90 dollars more, I got the phone part and the 3g data abilities in the Tab 3 with 3g (which is very much worth the added cost). The P211 I also purchased on Amazon and now I carry it everyday as a phone and mini tablet combo. So if you need a phone and tablet in one unit consider the Tab 3 7.0 3g as it is just one unit to carry for phone and tablet! Both my Tab 3 versions are peppy and run great!",

For under 200 bucks delivered  to my door not bad!!  2 weeks into use...HUGE  problem...the headphone jack went silent...started making a clicking sound only...now no sound!!  A common problem with the product based on my research.  You can go to wireless headphones...but me personally...I like hard wire so...I guess more EMF for my brain.?\n\nPositives:  No lag in key strokes, price is good... I like Samsung personally, graphics are clean, have'nt experienced pixilated screen with streaming video, size is perfect, SD card slot, more freedom than Apple products.  Again, you get your money's worth with Samsung.\n\nNegatives:  I believe a common manufacturing error has occurred with the headphone jack, as it started right out of the box and progressed to clicking alternating with working fine to now no audio at all from headphone jack.  Camera is not up to par with most Samsung cell phones from the same generation.\n\nI  will stay with the Samsung tablet due to freedom of controlling data etc...hopefully the next gen tab has a better camera megapixel like the S4...AND the headphone jack manufacture improves.",

                "review_body": "This tablet is good. Almost perfect size. Good size screen but still can fit in some large pockets. The stock memory of 8gb can be filled quick because some games can be 1gb in size. But the memory can be expanded easily and not for too much. Performance is good. I am still surprised by the graphics of some games. I just wish I could get or find a gimp or photoshop like app to do graphic designs on the go without having to root or basically hack the tablet. The wifi range is good if you are within your home or the same building as the router but it can get weak when  you are outside. I am looking for a way to boost its signal by maybe using an usb wifi adapter for rasberrry pi like boards and use a usb to micro usb adapter to connect it to the tablet. Should work since rasberry pi uses android and linux like this can but this tablet has to be hacked to root it so you can install linux while it comes with android out of box. I would recommend and buy this tablet again. Battery is about 12 hours with wifi off but with wifi on it can be drained in about 6 hours if you surf the net alot and can be drained even quicker if playing a game with 3d graphics while wifi is on. But with all the usb power adapters on the market I doubt that will be much of a problem for most people. I have two wall power adapters and one car adapter while only spending about 40 us dollars so i can not complain too much about having enough power for my needs.",

                "review_body": "Received the tablet just the other day and being my first tablet, it took a slight amount of  break in time.\nThe size is just right for me and I am glad I did not buy anything larger as easy and light portability was part of my buying decision.  The color quality far exceeded my expectations.  Played a newscast from NBC and it was almost as good as watching my HD TV. It is a fast device with a logical interface that provides smooth connections to the internet.\n\nI am impressed by how fast the start up and power off works..........literally a few seconds to connect or disconnect.  The keyboard is user friendly and if you purchase the optional 64gb micro sd card, you should plenty of storage space for smaller sized photos.  Apps are also downloaded with above average speed and work very well.\n\nOn the downside:\n\nStrength of Wi-Fi signal is reduced sometimes but not really a big issue as it usually shows full waves but when it falters I lose only one of them........still a reliable connection, although my laptop and notebook are 100% in the same area which is about three rooms away from the router.  When the tab is in the same room (or next room) as router it performs 100%.\n\nI know I can buy the screen protector (and I will), but fingerprints get piled up on the glossy screen quite fast.  So for now I wipe the screen with a good cleaning cloth designed for computer screens.\n\nLastly, I would rate the battery life as underperforming..........2-3 hours if high power is used.  Of course, you can adjust power in settings to save battery power.\n\nOther than these minor shortcomings, I feel that you are getting an excellent valued product for $199.  Don't think you will be disappointed at all.",

First thing I did was root it (XDA developers is AWESOME).  I left the stock rom on there, but needed root access for the Tasker app to be able to do all the things I wanted it to do.  I use an Akron dash holder to keep it mounted in my car.  When I power on the car, it boots Pandora, Waze, and other apps I want open while driving.  This thing spends 98% of it's time on my dash.  It does all these tasks admirably.  I have no idea how well it will do in the Utah summer heat though.  This is the WiFi model, I use WiFi hotspot from my phone for data while driving.\n\nPros:\n- Bright screen with decent resolution\n- Battery life is quite long (even though it is always plugged in while driving)\n- It's Android rooted, so you can do whatever you want if you know what you are doing\n- Audio is sufficiently loud (I normally have the headphones plugged in to my aux while driving but sound is good)\n\nCons:\n- Doesn't do great in the cold, even though I can't expect that; if it's cold, prepare for cold warnings and no charging, sluggish LCD refresh.\n- Menu/Back buttons don't light up on this 7\" model, sucks when night driving while trying to use it\n- Camera might as well not even be there, it has terrible resolution and horrible color.  Don't plan on using it for any reason.\n\nOverall, for a dash rider, it rocks.  Using Waze, Torque app for car data, Pandora or whatever music app you like, and Tasker seals the whole deal.  This app has a medium learning curve, but once you master it, you can make you phone do just about whatever you can imagine automatically.  8/10 would buy again.  Good for kids too at home with the WiFi.  If it breaks, oh well.  Not $500 bucks down the drain like an Ipad if it gets broken.  This thing has 200% more VALUE dollar for dollar over the Ipad.",

Plus, I can get him all sorts of childrens books that he'll have more fun reading on here than an actual real book. And lots of interactive books, which he loves.

                "review_body": "I did a lot of research before choosing to buy a tablet to use as an e-reader, and chose this one because of its size, price, and the fact I've always been very happy with Samsung products. The expandable memory allows a MicroSD card to expand the memory from the default 8GB for significantly less than it would cost to buy an e-reader or tablet with those same internal specs. The height and width dimensions are roughly the same as a mass-market paperback and are perfect for carrying it around on a daily basis and fitting in my purse.\n\nThe Android OS lets me install all the apps I need for what I read. Along with several news and magazine apps, I use reading apps for Kindle, Nook, Aldiko, and Kobo, and I'm confident I'll be able to find whatever else I'll need in the future to consolidate all my e-books in one place. Each app operates independently, so I can download reading material directly from the internet to the app or device or update my libraries with what I purchase using a computer or other device. The Dropbox app makes a good middleman for getting free books from Project Gutenberg or documents from other sources to Aldiko.\n\nThe way the tablet is set up physically makes it perfect for e-reading. There is a button on the lower left which gives different options based on the app being used, and the back button on the lower right toggles you back from the book to the library. To use the Kindle and Nook apps as examples, once the apps are up and running, you would not know you were on an Android tablet and not on a dedicated Kindle or Nook device.\n\nOf course, there are other perks to having a tablet, including being able to hook up to free wifi for internet browsing and email, games, Google maps, music, weather, other cool Android apps (which are very similar, if not identical, to iOS apps), widgets, and the front/back camera. The screen has the option for automatic brightness adjustment, so you're not always fiddling in the settings to make it comfortable to see.",

I will seek support from Samsung on how to fix the problems.\n\nUpdate 3/2/14 I followed the directions on the Samsung site of things to try and get it working again. One was to plug it in for one hour and then hold the on button down for 5 seconds. It booted up and works great. My daughter had already tried this a couple of times and it did not work for her. For now, the problem is resolved and I am sending it back to her. I am changing from one star to three (not 5 as it did stop working).",

I go to town on this thing.i can read pdf excel powerpoint presentations you have a world of apps.i dont know where this thing can go wrong. Im very careful about what I download if I dont use it its deleted.i havent saved much just still seeing how much it can manage.i did say before I started saving pictures & books I would get a micro sd card. the storage is expandable to I believe 64 gb.i can say so far the camera quality is a little ify.it may be one of those where you need bright light and a close up. Will test that more. Using the internet is just as good as the portability. and just when you think it may stall (not that its slow at all just low expectations) you see the blue processing line going across the top of the screen like lightning. So far im very much enjoying the tablet.along with this purchase I bought the tech armor anti glare & anti fingerprint screen protector (love it). I recall the reviews being ify but it was a snap for me its a 3 pk comes with a smoother & wiping cloth. I also purchased a silicone skin cover to protect from scratches. I think i will get a case. Its another level of protection it was a life saver for my last tablet. I liked to open in close like a book. One thing I wanted to mention if your looking at your screen and it looks too dark dont worry it auto adjust to your lighting. If the room has low lighting the screen will automatically dim. turn the lighting brighter then the screen gets brighter.  Oh another thing that drove me nuts was wanting to organize or remove apps or delete one of the 3 home screens. To move the apps around hold drag and drop. if you want on another screen hold and drag to either side you'll see a blue line as if turning the page. It'll go to the next screen. To delete apps hold drag and drop to the trash bin. To adjust the home screens while viewing the home screen drag your fingers across screen as if pinching the screen. the screens will minimize and you can drag and drop to the trash bin",

                "review_body": "First the good, people put down the screen resolution being low, but samsung screens are one of the best , there 1024 by 600 resoution is so much better than other screen with same resolution . Side by side with my kindle fire hd i can barely notice much difference. The tab is not extreme fast but it is not slow either, if you install  a task killer or ram manger , you can keep the ram clear and it will improve your browsing experience. People say it take 3 secs more to open apps, really 3 secs if you cant wait an extra 3 secs, its time to slow down your life.\n  I test the wifi and it works great the bars are not correct , when iam outside i get one bar but the tab work perfectly still loading pages and loading u-tube, test it yourself u will find even with 1 bar showing the connection is great.This is a perfect tab for movies and emails, the size is quite small and light fits almost perfectly in my pants pocket.\n  Since the price drop you can find these as low as 149.00 , which is a great price for the tab. The tv remote is great for using the tab to control tv.\n  Most people make fun or hate samsung touch wiz, but i love it , it has lots of useful features and mekes it easy to use the tablet, i have own the nexus 7 2013 and yes it is faster and smoother, but i like the samsung so much better, with the nexus you have to be very gental as it is very thin I was always afraid the screen would crack.\n  Like i said if you install a ram manager or task killer and keep the memory clear , you will find the tab work fine, as long as your not expecting it to be blazing fast....\n  Really the only real bad is the 8 gigs of strorage which is about 4.5 gigs useable .....",

The camera works well (even though he does not use it much). Mainly at this point he uses it for movies and music, browse web, play a few games and skype.

I'm still figuring out all the quirks. I wanted a tablet that I could carry when commuting by bike. WiFi only is fine; I have access to networks in most of the places I would want to use it. It saves paying for a data plan.\n\nThis little gadget is fast. The 7-inch screen seems quite generous, considering I would have settled for something even smaller. Now that I have it I'm glad I didn't. This one is the ideal size to fit the rack bags on either of the bikes I regularly use to commute. No complaints so far. I'll probably get a Bluetooth keyboard because it it hard to type on the virtual keyboard that comes up on screen. It's still surprisingly effective even with my fat fingers. I wouldn't want to blog a novel on it, but it will do for quick posts, email check-ins and spur of the moment searches.",

I couldn't pass up $149.00 shipped , using Prime . I have a Samsung Centura phone so I was easily familiar with the operating system and functions . Out of the box this tablet is awesome and does the things I want it to do . It's lightweight , battery life is pretty damn good around the 8/hr. mark depending on applications running and usage . It charges quickly like most Samsung products and comes with a nice Samsung-branded charger .\n\nThe only thing I wish it had , is the Multi-Window feature found in the Samsung Tab3 8\" and possibly the 5MP rear Camera of the 8\" , since this one is only 3MP . I think a fair competitor would be the ASUS Google Nexus 7\" which has a NVIDIA Tegra 3 quad-core processor and is priced in the same range . I am very happy and would definitely recommend this Tablet to first-time users and those wanting something smaller but very capable .",

This is not something that can be very well demonstrated because it can go days without locking up. I don't have the time or the inclination to try all of the various remedies suggested online. (I did a memory scan, which did not cure the problem.) So I'm going to put it on the shelf and use an old machine. Maybe after a few months I'll download the latest updates and try it again. This is really insidious because it can go a long time before locking up and then the likelihood of losing a lot of work is greater.

On the description of the unit on the AMAZON site it clearly states there is a FULL year warranty on this unit. Now TekRefurbs AND Amazon are claiming there is only 90 days!! Amazon \"CLAIMS\" the full year warranty is a manufacturers warranty, of course we ALL know the manufacturer has absolutely NOTHING to do with a refurbed unit. I still contacted them as I was asked to do and they confirmed to me that their warranty had expired in 2017, (and had been 3 years long). Still nothing from TekRefurbs NOR Amazon and now to make a bad issue worse, I had purchased an extended warranty when I bought the computer but when I contacted them they also told me the site says it has a year warranty so they will not honor their warranty because it doesn't go effect until the origional one expires! For whatever reason Amazon has now cancelled and refunded the extended warranty I had purchased when I purchased the machine!! I had NEVER mentioned nor asked them to cancel that!! So now I have NO hope of ever getting this covered. Still all I get from TekRefurbs AND Amazon is that the full year warranty is \"manufacturer\" warranty! This is a PRIME example of the beginning of the decline of Amazon. I know as much of my few thousand dollars have already started being spent elsewhere.!!",

Of course I did not receive it.  On top of that the computer once turned on and hooked up right made a loud noise over and over.  Given the fact it was late I waited till the next morning to try and install everything.  The next morning the computer was making an additional sound on top of the other clicks.  Once setup the Windows key did not work.  I restarted the computer and after I entered my password the screen would just go black and nothing would happen.  I called Amazon and they said they can only help with power problems.  With that we did a 3 way call to the manufacturer.  After having him look up the product he said that the warranty EXPIRED ON THIS IN 2014!  How is that even possible?  I literally just received the computer the day before, and on top of that I was shipped what I can only imagine is someone else return as the windows key was already taken.  Not sure if this is Amazons fault or the manufacturer.  I'm lead to believe it's Amazons as I would hope the manufacturer would not have computers that have expired warranties on their shelves.  I told them I would like to give them a second try and ship me one that has a NEW warranty and with the HDMI adapter, and the Amazon rep told me she could not guarantee that.  So basically my only option was to ship back for a refund.  BEWARE to all who buy this computer, even if it is working I would still call in and make sure your warranty is not EXPIRED! I have never left a negative review but I feel this was so bad I had to.",

We had an older Dell PC that lasted us from 2009 and I gotta say, we got our money's worth.

                "review_body": "This computer came very well packaged in one of those dedicated computer air cell packs that looks like a heavy duty pool flotation device folded over and heat sealed. The computer case had some minimal signs of prior use but nothing that would constitute what I would call \"wear\". Similarly inside the case was pretty clean although I could still see some dust and dirt buildup if I looked closely and shined a flashlight into the dark corners. It came with everything described in the listing, had open slots in the bus for a half height graphics card. No open memory slots so if you want to go up there you need to buy bigger sticks to replace the ones in there already.  The i7 processor is an older model that is capable but not very fast, not really anywhere near gaming capable as it sits.  I had to put in a graphics card in order to get a DVI output for our 27\" touch screen my son needs for his home schooling programs.  It is fast enough to stream the lectures he has to watch as well as handle the two-way meetings he uses for some of the classes, when I added a HD camera to the mix.  Plenty of USB plugs, some 2.0 and others 3.0 (I have not bothered to try to define which is which as we are not doing anything heavy enough to stress those systems.  It booted up fine and needed minimal oversight for setting stuff up.  We have had no problems in the first 3 months since we got it.\nAlthough it was not purchased for my boy to do gaming, he did try and discovered a significantly faster frame rate but still not good enough transfer rate to run modern graphics intensive games at a speed that satisfies him, so he is back over on his other gaming consoles for that.\nThe operating system is set up on the solid state drive so it boots up in about half the time of one booting from a hard drive.  And having the big HDD for long term storage is a perfect match.\nI am not sure if I would buy it again or not -- I would probably keep my eye out for a similar package but with a more recent and capable generation i7 processor and matching motherboard.  The small form-size is also a bit of a challenge if you plan on dropping a few cards into the bottom end of the bus as you have to make sure they are low profile and half height as there is some room but not a lot of room on the bus.",

                "review_body": "After reading the reviews and determining that I would either be fine, or not at all... I decided to take the 50/50 chance of receiving a decent tower.\n\nOrdered from Stalliontek along with a 1030 low profile GPU from NewEgg with hopes of using this as my 4K capable living room media PC.\nI first decided to plug it to a known, working monitor I pulled from my gaming PC set-up.  There was NO HDMI port as advertised, nor any HDMI adapter included.  Ok.. I read reviews of this happening but no worries as my monitor ALSO takes display port (which the tower had two of) and I was going to use the 1030 GPU's HDMI port when I eventually connected this to my living room TV anyway.\n\nWhile hooking everything up, I smelled the familiar smell of fresh spray paint.  Upon further investigation, I saw fresh black spots on the case where someone spray painted it black.  Ok, no biggy.... as long as the tower works I'm ok with the touched up blemishes.\n\nWhelp, after plugging everything in and using the display port from the MOBO to my known working monitor, there was no signal.  The PC turned on, but no boot, no bios splash screen nothing.  I started, restarted... plugged, unplugged... I tried it all.\nFigured, well... maybe it's the display ports that are bad on the MOBO (I tried both of them).  Plugged in my brand spanking new 1030 GPU and used its HDMI port.\nNo luck with that as well. Still no boot, BIOS splash screen.. nadda\n\nOn top of the MAJOR problem of not booting, there was no HDMI adapter, the case was spray painted AND I was unable to find/locate the windows serial number that a few reviews said was attached to the tower.  Upon inspecting the entirety of the case, I also found a poorly removed/scraped previous OS and windows key label.\n\nI build gaming PC's, but I took a chance on this one because I received $200 in Amazon gift cards recently which made this a decent buy for me for $199 out of pocket.\nI will also add that I checked for any loose connections, memory etc that may have come loose in shipping, but came up empty handed.\nThis PC was just DOA.  Also worth noting to those interested, there is no additional room on the MOBO for another SATA connection.  There are 3 total... one for Disc reader, one for SSD boot drive and one for HDD storage drive.\n\nKudos to the seller for making the return easy at least. So thanks!",

                "review_body": "This is easily the best technology purchase I have made in years.\n\nI bought it to replace my ACER laptop which I bought six years ago. This laptop still works fine but I could see that it was struggling to handle multiple open browser windows.  I often have 12+ windows open across three browsers each.  My Acer is a core i5 4300m, 6GB RAM machine - which was admittedly fast in 2012.\n\nFast forward to this HP desktop. It's super-fast with its 240GB SSD which I think makes all the difference.  The set up with Win 10 Pro was so easy.  The machine is not pre-configured to your product key but instead to some generic key. When you unpack the box, the product key is clearly visible stuck on the back of the machine.  Just write it down and save it somewhere safe. When Win 10 comes up, try and customize it - like the screen or mouse.  It then prompts you for the product key.  And you're done.\n\nWhen you set up your browsers, choose the option where they remember all your open windows.  The magic is when you restart the machine and click on your favorite browser.  All those browser windows display instantly, yes, instantly.  Opening a document or saving it is also instant.  The SSD is one of the best technology inventions ever.\n\nThis desktop practically makes no sound at all.  It's sitting on the floor of my home office.  Also, it freed up valuable space on my desk.  Previously, I had my laptop sitting next to my desk lamp.  Notice how much free space I now have.\n\nThe machine comes with sufficient numbers of USB ports that I put away the two dongle USB hubs for my laptop.  It also comes with a USB adapter for WiFi which is plug and play.  Also an adapter to convert your video port into HDMI.\n\nAll in all, I'm super impressed with the product.  Great value too, considering that new machines with this configuration cost hundreds more.",

Fired it up and started my customizations.  So far everything is working fine.  The refurbisher did try to paint over some cosmetic scratches and that's fine but what I am interested in is the condition of the system and so far its fine. Its a couple of notches above my current system so looking for performance improvement with heavy lifting tasks.  Will come back later to update but so far this seems to be good value over a new system.\n\nUpdate - 4/26/2019 - Have been using now for a few weeks and it seems to be running as expected.  My HP desktop that was failing was able to repair (CPU fan blade had splintered and it cleared) so I have two really good systems.  Since I am not a gamer, the limitation on the video adaptor doesn't concern me.  Since my old system is working again, I can phase in the installation of apps as time permits.  I have read the stories of some folks getting DOA units but mine was solid out of the box.  I am good.",

I am a graduate student who needed a lightweight computer (its super light) because I am placed many different places. I primarily use the google drive function and just surf/use for streaming. It won't run complex games, nor do you have the ability to really use as many program functions like on a pc (you don't carve a turkey with a butter knife, so don't use a chromebook to run complex programs). It has AMAZING battery life! I used to have a $1100 notebook that was lucky to survive 2 hours, this lasts all day on a single charge, easily around 8 hours of use. You should know by now that you also need internet for everything except you can edit docs offline. If you want nice leisure computer to do some light work and streaming, I highly recommend it.",

Just wanted a workhorse tablet to read ebooks on.\n\nHowever, there is no sim card / TF card slot, although the website description says: \"Card Slot: Dual Card Slot (Two sim cards and one TF card can be installed at the same time).\"\n\nOn first boot, the tablet opened directly to the home screen with a desktop background of flying birds, not to the expected Android first-time set-up screen.\n\nSettings > about tablet confirms 64 GB of on board storage, but could not find a way to confirm amount of RAM.\n\nBattery runs down shockingly fast, even when the tablet is idle. Could not find a way to confirm battery size.\n\nExtremely rapid battery drain and the lack of the promised external storage slot are dealbreakers for me.\n\nWhen I tried to return this item, I discovered that I would be expected to pay for return shipping to China, so I am stuck with a ~$70 paperweight. Extremely disappointed.\n\nCannot recommend item or seller, unfortunately.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nWas on Alibaba and saw this tablet for around half the price I paid here. Scrolled through the photos and discovered that the top of this tablet, at the camera end, is removable and reveals...SIM CARD SLOTS! At a loss as to why this information was not included in the product manual that came with the tablet, nor in the product photos on Amazon, or, indeed, on the tablet itself. But, I am retracting part of the above review, and adding a star since the product is as described.\n\nBattery life is still abysmal though, so can't recommend, unfortunately, unless you plan to keep it connected to its charger while using, which kind of defeats the purpose of a portable tablet.\n\nBut, SIM CARD SLOTS! *tiny high five*",

                "review_body": "Purchased two days ago, arrived yesterday, and so this review is NOT based on longevity (I'll come back in a month or two for that), but on features, build quality, and overall feel. Build quality out of the box is good. Body is aluminum and has a nice MacBook (I have an older Mac Air) feel to it. Not much flex when typing (I'm using it for this review), chiclet keys have a good feel to them, and not too cramped, which I like. Back-lit keys are a necessity for me (once you've had them, you never want one without) and this has silver keys with a white backlight. Very clean look. Screen looks great, full HD 1080p, which on a 15\" screen is perfect (4k just seems like overkill on a small screen). Boots FAST, shuts down fast, of course with a solid state hard drive (the future of all computers) no hard drive bottleneck. Fingerprint scanner (on right side near the \"-\" button works most of the time, but honestly, putting in a 4 digit pin is just about as fast. BIG touchpad, with great response. And finally, HP did it right with the Intel i5 and i7 (not Ryzen) models, room to expand. Yes, just pop the bottom cover off, and \"voila!\", you have a spare hard drive bay, and guess what, they installed a single 8GB stick of ram and left the other ram slot empty, so no ditching your existing ram to upgrade. Just purchase another 8GB stick of DDR4 laptop ram and pop it in, 16GB. One downside is the empty hard drive bay does not have the cable you need to go from hard drive to motherboard, and I'm still not sure where to get it. If you find one post below and let me know. Okay, that's it...with 18 months same as cash, this is a great laptop. Sell your old one on eBay! Hope this helps. :)",

It doesn\u2019t have a camera kill switch or a adjustable keyboard light, and it has an anti-skid pad across the top front which is a bit unappealing. However, it\u2019s a serviceable mid range laptop. Works in terms of not being trapped in Windows 10 S. It also has decent battery life (5ish hours of streaming on battery before dropping under 10%). Reliable, but not lightning fast. If you\u2019re interested in gaming, it can run some older games just fine; Diablo 3 ran well at typical settings, Starcraft 2 ran, but was ugly.",

After 3 weeks, the touchscreen stopped working along with the touchpad, gyroscopic driver, and keyboard. After countless hours of talking to customer service from HP and even letting them have remote-access, they simply do not want to help. In addition, they kept telling me about the raving reviews they had for the laptop. Well, looks like I'm writing the first review. After this debacle, I wouldn't recommend this product or company to any of my fellow Amazon customers. Please consider purchasing a different laptop from a different company who will actually provide decent service.\n\nPS: HP will refuse to help you unless you've purchased the laptop from HP, so this is in no means Amazon's fault. Amazon's hands are tied in this situation and HP simply sold me a faulty product and will not admit it or replace it in a timely manner.",

I don't do anything very taxing on it but it is very snappy for web browsing, word processing, and even some light photo editing. It is very thin and lightweight and has good battery life. Personally I don't find the 360 \"tablet\" mode very useful as it feels awkward to hold since the keyboard flips around the back of the screen but the mode works fine if you're into that. Only problem I've had with it was the fingerprint scanner stopped working after a forced update, but I was able to revert back to the previous fingerprint scanner driver and have no problems since.",

If it's not in your bedroom - probably not a problem. But it's bad enough for me to knock a star off.\n\nSecond - a few times for a few months after it arrived, it would hard lockup while sleeping. No input would wake it and I would have to shut it down with the power button. Don't know if it was some kind of bios or driver issue, but it seems to have gone away and haven't had to do that for quite some time now.\n\nAs for the pros - It's a beast of a machine with an RTX3070 and a ryzen processor which are kind of hard to find together. The screen is beautiful. The keyboard is functional but not particularly good or bad. Wifi and Bluetooth are similarly passable. RAM is kind of low on this model and you'll want to upgrade. Note that it contains two 8GB sticks, not a single 16GB so if you want 32GB you need two 16's. M2 socket to add a harddrive is easy to use, but the case is a little challenging to open.

Now I was coming from an all in one desktop set up called Lenovo 520, which limited me from trying many things, such as 3d but it was good enough for 1080p video editing.\n\nHowever since I was always on the move with clients, I needed something portable, reliable and strong enough to handle almost everything I throw at it, I was looking at zephyrus g14,g15, legion 5 pro and many laptops in the same class but this one stuck out to me cuz it was giving the best processor available at the time, 5900HX, and the graphic card I wanted, RTX 3070.\n\nNow even though I bought this laptop for professional creative work, this laptop is a gaming BEAST, it handles everything with so much ease, and does it really well. Almost all games are able to achieve higher than 100fps, which is insane, especially for someone like me who has played on consoles all his life, 30fps was usually the limit but theres so many possibilities with a gaming computer.\n\nAs for my creative work, it handles everything like a champ! even on battery and igpu turned on it performs extremely well and I see almost no issues, when working on photoshop, or editing my videos.\n\nHowever not everything is perfect, while this laptop is great in almost all regards, I am often really worried about its longevity. I expect to use this machine for at least 5 years, my issue comes down to how the heat is handled or how toasty it actually gets. I don't mind too much fan noise cuz I have my headphones plugged in and its non existent to me, but while I game on performance mode, which is the default profile setting for cpu,gpu and the fans, I see temperatures around 80 or sometimes even 85 while playing Witcher 3, on high settings, I bring it down to medium settings and it almost makes no big difference, and sometimes even in my creator tasks which aren't very demanding, it again reaches around 70 degrees celcius. I have however found a solution to this, and use manual profile, which does get a bit loud but the temps are great. however I do worry about the fans and their lifespan cuz of it. you can always get a cooling pad and help yourself as well. i heard people get great results from that as well.\n\nin conclusion, the best laptop I have tried, amazing performance, amazing size and fun to play on. worth it in my use case, only downside being the temperatures but you can work around the problem in various ways!",

                "review_body": "It's able to run two high graphics demand games at once while streaming, which I tested just to see what limits it might have. The only thing I feel should be pointed out is that after downloading the newest Nvidia drivers it will no longer be able to run in turbo without crashing. Be aware and stick to the Nvidia drivers that are compatible to avoid this. Version 466.11 is the latest compatible version.\n\nThe computer runs hot, but that's to be expected from a laptop trying to run the way it does. My advice is buy a cooling pad and never run it without it. Ventilate it properly -this is not a laptop to sit in your lap or on fabric. It will damage itself with the heat buildup if you don't properly care for it.\n\nOverall I'm extremely pleased with it.",

                "review_body": "This computer is a beast. What I was really impressed with is how long you can use it on battery if you aren\u2019t doing heavy gaming. You can set it to igpu mode which will let it last 8-9 hours on battery as long as you put it on silent mode. For streaming, browsing and doing documents it should last at least 6 hours.\n\nI really wanted a 1440p screen but with this screen at 300hz it\u2019s beautiful! I\u2019m not a big fan of LCD but it\u2019s a very high quality screen. Pictures don\u2019t do it justice. If I want 4K I\u2019ll just hook it up to a TV.\n\nI like that it\u2019s a very small 15\u2019 laptop. It\u2019s not chunky at all and it\u2019s not over designed. I thought I would have heat issues with a 3070 but the laptop handles the heat very well. It\u2019s not burning my legs when gaming.\n\nI\u2019ve had no problem playing all my games maxed out. A lot of the benchmarks I see for this use poorly optimized games so it\u2019s not fair to this laptop.\n\nThe keyboard is nice. I didn\u2019t want a mechanical keyboard because they get noisy. With LEDs off on everything it looks low profile. It\u2019s really easy to turn the LEDs and to customize.\n\nI really haven\u2019t seen any bottlenecks for what I use it for. This laptop is the sweet spot. In my opinion this is better designed than the Zephyrus because the rear heat exhaust isn\u2019t hitting the screen.\n\nOnly thing I would have liked to see is a numpad with the keyboard and an aluminum frame.",

Graphics card has died 8 months later after purchase. Dealing with ASUS warranty is painful and frustrating to say the least. I'm hoping ASUS will eventually allow me to send the laptop to them to either fix it or replace it.\n Update ASUS will not cover the 1 year warranty with a third party seller (Computer Upgrade Express and Amazon). Now I have a broken laptop and Computer Upgrade Express mentioned that they could repair it, but they are no longer responding to messaging. At this point I would NOT recommend buying anything for Computer Upgrade Express.",

To my surprise after hooking the machine up everything seemed to be in order and functioning.  UNTIL!!!\n\nLiterally days before the unit's 90days with me arrived, disaster.  Unit boots, black screen, BOIS.  Anytime and Every time.  Tried all the troubleshooting I could come across.  So as i gave up hope and contacted Amazon (still 2 days it it's 90th with me), who informed me they would not issue a replacement nor would they accept the unit as a return.  They instructed me to research the manufacture myself for contact info.  Way you go Amazon CS you really followed through here (Amazon CS did stay true to themselves - BECAUSE THEY TREAT ALL MY RECENT ISSUE LIKE THIS).  Long story make slightly shorter, after finally finding some link/email for manufacture but received no response  from them (1month to date).  The seller was very reluctant to offer their help it seems.  Partly due to there being no data recovery policy in place for this unit and or situations similar to mine. So far best offer to fix this is 1.)I pay for shipping to manufacture, and SUBMIT the bill to seller for reimbursement 2.)Some time after shipping unit to manufacture and submitting proof to seller, SELLER will send me a similar replacement unit as soon as they can. (NO TURN AROUND TIMES GIVEN FOR ANY OF THE 2 ABOVE ACTIONS OR FOLLOWING) 3. Instructed to remove the SSD from the defective unit and connect it to another machine somewhere to retrieve my info - Who ever thought of that procedure and implemented it in real life situations needs a vacation.

This i5-1135G7 is a workhorse. Fast. The pc works well in all demanding software i have used, and has become the most used of all i have in the minis. Fast in all aspects and quiet. No lock-ups or reboots. Nice Quality Product i am glad to have. A word on/to reviews/ers: If you don't know how to upgrade hardware,  use it like it was sold to you. i.e. Don't tear it up from inability, then give the company/seller a 1 star rating. Sure the sata cable connetions on most these minis are flimsy, like some excuses. If you want Tough: buy a case,powersupply, motherboard, cpu,ram, drives, All of good quality,, and build you one that doesn't flex here and there, and has real upgrade options. Don't forget the OS - which may cost you half of what you paid for the Bosgame i5-1135G7 that already has it.",

It\u2019s been 2 Years with this laptop all through college and airports and It\u2019s held up great! The battery is not very great and you really need to bring the charger everywhere you go unless you\u2019re just moving rooms in your house for less than an 1 and a half. It can get annoying trying to watch Netflix or YouTube and it constantly needs to be plugged in. While gaming you definitely need to plug in or your games will run half as slowly as they should be, it\u2019s a feature to save battery but it makes the gameplay horrible. I can say this laptop replaced my gaming desktop and I\u2019ve used it basically everyday for 2 years, and it\u2019s still running smooth.\n\nI would definitely recommend getting another stick of RAM for the laptop, there\u2019s a free slot already so you just need to get either an 8gb or 4gb stick of laptop ram depending on what you already have, just match it up and your games will be running amazingly.\n\nIt can easily play GTA V, Fortnite, Warzone, basically anything you throw at it if you play with the graphic settings. I also recommend buying a gaming mouse because using the trackpad can be impossible for certain games.\n\nThe most annoying thing about the laptop is that all the ports. 3 USBs, Ethernet, charging, is all on the left side of the computer so using wired mice and headsets can get annoying, and you have to loop it behind. Just the one complaint i have over the years.",

Which limits the charging to 60%/80% or full charge\n\n4) applying thermal paste\n\n5) undervolting this monster of a machine.

Good luck if you didn't pack the ac adapter when traveling with it. Pros: nice size, durable outer shell. Cons: dim backlit keys, loud fan, hard drive could be larger considering this is a gaming unit, battery life is absolutely abysmal. Laggy wifi and spotty Bluetooth.",

Unfortunately, the Ryzen 7 3850h alongside the GTX 1650 M is not enough to play games such as Fortnite at 120 fps. I had all my settings set to low except view distance and 3D resolution, and I was barely getting 80 fps, which would drop down to 50 during heated fights. During night time in-game, I would hardly see anything because of how dim the screen was.\nOverall, the device is worth the price but might not be what you are looking for. I would suggest their A15 model equipped with the RTX 2060 and the Ryzen 7 4800h for First-Person Shooter games such as Fortnite, Apex, CS GO, etc.\n\nTo conclude, the Asus fx505 is a device that is worth its price but might not be for heavy gaming because of the low specs it has and its dim screen. For 300 dollars more, you can get the A15, which is more equipped for heaving gaming.\n\nOh, and the fans get loud during games, but it doesn't bother me.",

Problem is a Zeus don't kick out any driver upgrade software. And neither does Microsoft. For all this money I shouldn't have to pay out the nose for more software.\nThe problem is is AMD has software, Asus has software, Samsung, and every other little driver. Well they all put their little storage banks on the hard drives then adds up real fast.\nI just need the driver's I don't need all this bloatware.\nThey are conflict in each other.\nI've had probably 15 blue screen of death and it's never the same thing.\nI've had to reload Windows 10 pro probably five times in the last month or so.\nI don't know a Zeus has a software program that is a program but you must have the Microsoft app to go with it which I think Microsoft apps suck and is part of the combat compatibility issue. But as soon as I load them drivers my crap freezes.\nI'm just really disappointed. I pretty much have a $1,600 brick. You must really know what you're doing to tolerate this poo. Make sure you have a thumb drive bootable. might as well put all your software on on another thumb drive too.\nI bought this for a good motherboard and foundation upgradable for reason.\nI last a Zeus notebook upgrades no problem.\nI have wanted to throw this off the third story building, and smash it to pieces I'm not upset then I realize how much money I have into it.\nAlso noticed my wireless mouse 2.0( in 2.0 port) has issues bad wont work with 3.1 drives 3.0 ports (2.0 compatible) Mouse freaks out and wont work at all.

                "review_body": "I was very impressed by the item description and read a couple of reviews and quickly purchased the ASUS TUF (2019) Gaming Laptop, 15.6\u201d 120Hz Full HD IPS-Type, AMD Ryzen 7 3750H, GeForce GTX 1650, 8GB DDR4, 512GB PCIe SSD version.  While waiting for UPS to deliver the laptop, as it needed a signature, I started reading all the reviews. I quickly became very concerned with the reviews detailing the BSOD's and black screens. I then googled video reviews, and found that almost all reviewers by professional techs recommended this laptop as a beginner's gaming machine.\n\nI have now used the laptop for approximately 12 hours and have these observations. First the negative. I HATE that all USB slots are on the left side of the laptop. There is nothing on the right side. I spend a lot of time gaming and laying down with the laptop on my belly and I have my left hand resting on the left side as I constantly use the Function 1-4 keys. The USB plug in adapter is rubbing a blister on my hand as there is no way to avoid it unless I don't use a mouse, which is unacceptable. The arrow keys are a little to far towards the middle, so I had to program the number pad keys for moving in game. Also, the F1 key starts too far to the right, so I have had to program my gaming keys somewhat.\n\nWith that said, the laptop runs smoothly, is very quiet and does not run hot at all. Now I only play Everquest which is not a demanding game for a PC, but there is no heat or noise from the fans. I like the keyboard other than what I described above, and have no idea why some people have complained about the keyboard and touch pad. The lighted keyboard does change colors, but it isn't a distraction for me at all, so I haven't tried to change it to stay at one color as of yet.\n\nSo I like this laptop. If I experience any issues I will update my review.",

However, within three months, the hard drive failed completely with without warning from the SMART system, and I lost everything on it. At that point, I reached out to Snow Bell for a refund for the cost of the hard drive, which they quickly got back to me about and everything was great.\n\nSince then, I've just had a world of problems with this laptop. The system device and display drivers kept failing, making my HDMI port unusable. Several of my keys are discolored or partially burnt out. The function allowing me to change my fan speed didn't work any longer than the first day I used it. The track pad, as some other users have complained about, is slow to respond and often rebellious against what you actually want it to do. The screen flickers like a candle when the brightness is anything but 100% when it's running on battery, and the fan on the left side rattles loudly if the laptop is anything but perfectly level.\n\nOf course, I reached out to Snow Bell again, but where their customer service got back to me in a matter of hours before, it's been days and they seem to be nowhere to be found. Even Amazon failed to connect me to their customer service call center. Maybe I just got a dud, but I'm thanking my past self for purchasing a warranty, as that seems to be my only option for this lemon now.",

Yes i believe if you have any sorts of knowledge about computers your going to buy this and be able to fix any problems you come across. Its a powerful computer that's portable for gamer's.

The product description indicates a 192gb hard drive, which is does have, however, it was received with the drive already partitioned into a c: drive of 62gb and a d: drive of 128gb. It would be expected that the drive, if partitioned at the factory, would have a much smaller d: drive loaded with recovery data for consumer to use in the event of an issue sometime down the road; giving the consumer the option to partition the drive to his/her particular desires. Though that issue can be corrected by the consumer, it is disappointing that the option is not readily available to less-experienced users.\nUPDATE: Purchased in June 2022. Trusted Amazon and HP - my mistake. This product is a toy compared to a real computer. I am disappointed in its performance but even more disappointed in the inability to upgrade the unit to make it more in-line with what I use a computer for - had no idea it could not be tweaked to improve the internal storage and memory. Basically piece of garbage - will rework my Toshiba laptop even though it is older technology and will not accept Windows 11 but that is a secondary issue - at least it is a better overall machine!!!!!!",

Says i have to first register windows, but when i try, it says it cant register my version of windows (which is listed as windows 10 and has what appears to be a valid product key), and i have to first visit \"the store\" and purchase A GENUINE VERSION OF WINDOWS. . .So i guess that means this computer came with a fake version of windows that allows you to turn it on and set it up, but wont actually allow you to use the computer and go online or anything. I cant even use Word because it too has to be registered online, which requires that i first register windows, but again, i cant. Already loaded too many personal files on it to be comfortable returning it, so i guess what i bought is a really really expensive external hard drive to store my media on, because that is the only thing it will allow me to do.\n\nI stopped buying Dell over a decade ago because their quality went way down and their stuff just wasnt worth anything to me anymore. I decided to give it a shot again cause i just needed something small and inexpensive to use mainly for writing. I wasnts expecting anything great, but I never dreamed that their quality would be so severely lacking now that i wouldnt even be able to use Word or get online to download another word processor!

I am not too crazy about the touch pad as well, so I use a wirless mouse instead.\n\nthe resolution is the biggest drawback for me, my eyes hurt after i work on my project for half hour.

I never write a reveiw and am only on here because I've wasted so much time with this product.  I'm sorry guys because I buy a lot of good products and I rely on customer reviews and always want to leave one but am never motivated enough till I've lots so much time and money.\n\nOne of the three was DOA and was sent back for a refund because the other two seemed to have Chinese malware installed and I manually removed but didn't want to do it for a third one (all gifts) after that.\n\nOf the two remaining, one is rarely used because the person said its too slow!  You will click a button and then watch it click on the system a second later and then start a really slow load.  The person using it is young and so hasn't used it much or complained but I know its just junk.\n\nThe third one that has been used for school is broke after 7 months of causal use.  The F1 key popped out 1st.  The left hinge stopped working a month ago.  Now the \"reduce volume seems to be stuck but if you press it, it responds so it must be a software issue but it's volume down icon on the screen is stuck and keeps trying to go lower.  We have tried to do a factory reinstall but it's still stuck.  Dell wants $219 to fix the F1 key and hinge and can't say if the volume down software issue can be fixed.  I paid $299 for these devices on black friday and have lost hundreds more in time trying to clean them up and maintain them out of guilt for the recipients.\n\nThis is just a truly sad product and I hope it just all came from a bad batch for Dell and their customers sake.",

When it gets like that you may as well set it on the table and leave it until it finally starts doing something several minutes later. I'm talking about basic tasks like opening a web browser or even logging on from startup. It would just get stuck. We kept it up to date and ran virus scans regularly. She only used it to check facebook, email and basic web browsing. It should have never been released, especially for $500. If it's trying to do a windows update you can't do anything else with it until the update is complete because it doesn't have the processing power to do more than one thing at a time. A $500 computer should be able to easily handle basic tasks. We will probably wipe it and give it to a thrift store. I wouldn't give it to anyone I know. I'm definitely disapointed to know Dell would sell something like this. Maybe we got a bad one but I have seen enough bad reviews to know ours isn't the only bad one.",

The hardware can seemingly just barely keep up with even the OS, so oftentimes getting it fired up can take awhile.  Add-ons from Dell like Support Assist, which seemingly does nothing useful by the way, slow down the computer even more. When it decides it wants to work, it generally works fine, but getting to that point seems to take some effort.  All I use it for is browsing the internet and it can't even keep up with that.  What you pay for here is the touchscreen and not the computer.

                "review_body": "I purchased this device as a replacement for my Dell Inspiron 11 3147. My older device was having issues with the touchscreen (as well as other hardware issues) and was no longer under warranty so I decided to find a replacement. After a LOT of research into other brands, Dell was the only brand I could find with an 11.6\" screen that had a decent processor, so I bought a newer version of my older model.\n\nThe Bali Blue is really nice. The color has more purple in it than the pictures would lead you to believe, which was a little bit of a let down, but still looks great. However, the case is very cheap plastic, think those old lunch boxes from the 90s, it feels a lot like that. This is a definite downgrade from the 3147 model, which had a sturdy metal casing. The screen also seems to be of lower quality than the 3147 had. Even looking at it straight on, you will notice that the bottom of the screen is brighter than the top. If you pull up an all black image (like the Dell boot screen) you'll notice that the top is black (as it should be), while the bottom is a bright gray, approaching white). This is not usually an issue when using in laptop mode. However, if you switch it to tablet mode and rotate into portrait mode to say, read a book,whichever side was bottom in laptop mode is noticeably brighter than the other. It makes the text appear to become boldened as you read. Also, if the book you are reading does not take up the whole screen, you will have black bands at the top and bottom, which is normal. But, with the brightness issue, if you move the tablet even a little while you read, the brightness seems to flicker and can be really distracting. (To note: it does not actually flicker, it just appears to due to the screen not appearing the same from all angles).\n\nFirst and second boot ups were really slow when compared to my older model, but it seems to be doing better now. (Probably had to do with background apps downloading updates, etc.)\n\nThe keyboard is firm and responsive and feels like an improvement over the older 3147 model. Time and use will determine if this is the case.\n\nYou cannot upgrade the RAM in this unit as it is soldered to the motherboard unlike the 3147 model. Processor also cannot be upgraded for the same reason.\n\nTL;DR: This was given 3 stars, because as a standalone it's a fairly average and inexpensive device. Compared to the previous model this should probably be a 2 star rating due to cheaper materials/hardware and cosmetic changes. Ultimately feels like a downgrade over the older model.",

My dual band router or its settings could have been a factor but I could not find a setting that worked.  The wireless speed was so bad that I thought about returning it.  However, I found a simple upgrade that allowed me to connect to the 5 GHz band and get back the wireless speed at 800-900 Mbps.\n\nI bought the following wireless card from Amazon and used the YouTube video link to learn how to access and remove the existing card.\n-- 7260NGW Intel\u00ae Dual Band Wireless-AC 7260 802.11ac, Dual Band, 2x2 Wi-Fi + Bluetooth 4.0\n-- [...]\nA minor drawback is the keyboard and touchpad.

Not true when the mother board stops working and it's outside the warranty. So now, I buy cheap ones like these and just replace them when they stop functioning correctly without it being a big hit to my wallet. It works just fine for all my needs - mainly internet use. I store all my files in the cloud now (another lesson learned) so it doesn't bog down my memory and I don't lose everything when it inevitably won't turn on one day. My only frustration with this model is that the power button is flush with the right side of the computer. Sometimes when I am trying to move the computer around, I accidentally hit the power button. I would prefer if it were up near the keyboard so I don't bump it accidentally and put it in sleep mode. The lid is ultra glossy so I am sure it will get scratched very easily. I bought a simple neoprene sleeve (amazon basics) to store it in because I don't want it to look like garbage within a short time of having it. The power block on the cord is smaller than my last one, so that's nice. It's light so easy to carry with me and does the job. I'm satisfied.",

                "review_body": "Great mid-range tablet, so far. If you immediately update the firmware and the rest of the software on it you won't have any of the automatic shut off problems other used to list. It seems Samsung has fixed the problem quite a while ago. In terms of battery life, it's surprising how long this thing can hold a charge. If you're a heavy user (i.e. movie/shows back-to-back, digital drawing, constant web surfing) expect it to last all day. I'm a light user and have had the charge last me all week. As for the included SD card, while nice, you should really opt for a 256GB one. The paltry on-board space and the included SD card will fill up fast. If you can't, be aware that some apps can't be swapped over to the SD card to free up space on your tablet. For example Amazon's Audible app and Kindle app can be sent to external storage on the SD card, but Prime Video cannot. Also since this is a Samsung tablet it's full of their bloatware that most people don't end up using and takes up valuable space, though you can disable most of them so they're at least not taking up system resources. The tablet surprisingly boasts some nice privacy options for those uncomfortable with the prospects of being tracked or giving up personal data to Big Tech. Though if you're going to use this tablet you will probably need a Google account, but at least you can decide what info you wish to give them. The tablet feels sturdy and looks to be made with quality, but you'll probably want to get some sort of case and screen protector for it. Play it safe.  It comes with your standard micro USB charging cord, and an outlet charging adapter. I may be wrong, but I believe it's a fast charging adapter. I say this because I bought a magnetic charging cable for this tablet to reduce the strain on the charging port, and the magnetic cable claims to be fast charge capable as long as the device and its outlet adapter support it. So I tried it out and was able to charge this tablet to 100% in 45 minutes. Not too shabby. It also supports capacitive styluses if you feel so inclined to use one for note taking or drawing and editing.\n\nSo if you're looking for decently priced tablet as a starter, or one for your kids, this model ain't so bad. It won't have all the bells and whistles of say, a Galaxy Tab S5E or an iPad Pro, but that's ok, I'd rather not part with $500-$800 on a tablet anytime soon.",

I've put almost every App I use on my phone on here including Netflix, YouTube etc. Everything runs fast. 16GB memory not an issue - only using half that so far. The 32GB sim card included holds all the photos and audio files I need to carry on this tablet. Thoroughly recommend - not sure why you would spend upward of $600 for a 10.1 tablet - this one is excellent. By the way, I also purchased a MoKo case for $13 which was very good quality also.

When connecting the mouse, a windows style mouse pointer appears on the screen.  The keyboard used is the Rii BT11 Ultra-slim Wireless Bluetooth Keyboard available on Amazon.

It'll be working just fine and then all of a sudden it freezes and the only way to get it to do anything is a hard restart. I work on computers doing support so I know different workarounds, but it's the computer. I don't know if this one mis faulty or what, but it's awful!\n\nI have done everything and yet it's still doing it. This is basically now a piece of garbage and I don't think they care because once you give them your money, they move on. Too many people buying from them and no accountability!\n____\n\nI was able to send this back to get repaired and wanted to update about interaction at that point. I sent the computer to be repaired and the seller had provided a label so that was free. My tracking number indicated it had been received so I waited to hear from them telling me they'd gotten it. Nothing. So I emailed them and they finally did say they'd gotten it and I should give them 10 days and they'd send it back. No updates, nothing. I'm just supposed to divine, I guess, what they're doing and hope and pray that I get the computer back working. Not happy. I mean, glad they're willing to repair this, but it would sure be nice if they would take time to update me.\n\nI have returned it twice for repairs and it's doing the same thing. And the restocking fee is $125. This is a big scame. Please don't fall for it!!!!!!!!!",

Probably why it was returned in the first place.  I spent 45 minutes on the phone with linksys support and they couldn't get it working (resetting router, updating firmware, etc.).  I did some internet research and found that the issue I experienced was fairly common.  I returned the router via amazon.\n\nI ordered another refurbished model (this time I stepped up to the EA9400) and it worked for about a day before it became stuck in a reboot mode.  Even a reset attempt of the router would not get it out of this reboot \"loop\".  Found many others had experienced the same and it required sending back the unit.\n\nI WILL NEVER BUY A REFURBISHED LINKSYS PRODUCT AGAIN.  THEY OBVIOUSLY DON\"T DO ENOUGH TO FIND THE ORIGINAL PROBLEM ON RETURNED DEVICES.  THEY SIMPLY FLASH THE SYSTEM, DUST IT OFF AND PACKAGE IT BACK UP TO BE SOLD TO THE NEXT UNSUSPECTING VICTIM...",

Connected the unit to our netwrok (small business) and then attached the USB external drive. The router started rebooting on its own. Got past that and set up the driver for access. Hung up with support, then the entiire unit went offline again. Reset it, then tried to connect to phone. Wireless strength was only 1 or 2 bars right next to the unit. Also no internet connection on wireless, but did have internet connection on ethernet. Nex day called support aagain. Began another long, drawn out process to troubleshoot, then tech stopped and said to return unit to Amazon. Hh then wanted to upsell me to the EA9500 for $160 more than I paid for this unit and buy it directr from Linksys. I said no thank you and ended the call. Complete disaster. DO not buy the EA9xxx series of routers. There is serious trouble. Do some internet searches and you will see. Buyer beware!",

I asked Dell for a refund so that I could upgrade my model but no commitment on that. Laptop have an amazing configuration in cheap price but it's not worth risk buying it with such annoying noise. I thought it's only me but there are lot's of people facing fan issues with this model.

Some about the brightness of the screen, some about the quality of the RGB color gamut range, some about the \"junk\" included with the laptop.\nI received the laptop fast with Amazon Prime, in very good packaging and good condition. Initial setting was a breeze, and immediately had a good feeling about the speed of the hardware/system. Once all windows updates were applied, I always go to control panel to remove all unwanted \"junk\". Surprised that there was not any at all. Pretty clean, and I did not have to remove anything. There was not MacAfee,  nor other annoying trial versions of any programs. Only some Windows apps, mostly games, that it was easy to remove from the store. That was very good, and went on installing my own programs such as Office 2016, ACDsee photo suit, etc. No problems. The screen quality is pretty good, I did not get this laptop for photo editing, I do that on my desktop. As far as the screen brightness is concerned, people seem to not take under consideration that a good part of it is tide to the power plan used by the user. That is very easily changed under the notification panel on the right of the taskbar, where the brightness of the screen can be control to taste. Then you can have a much brighter screen. I am not sure that it will be bright enough for \"interrogations\", however is bright enough for me.\nBottom line, I am very pleased with the laptop. It's portability is a fun aspect of its use. It is a good looking laptop, and yes, so far I love it.\nI would recommend this laptop for general and comfortable use. Please remember, it is not an $1,800.00 machine, but it is perfect for what was meant to be used on this price range, and a joy to use.\nAdditionally, it is upgradeable, so one will not have to pay that $1,800.00 price for more memory and larger storage capacity.",

This is with normal usage (normal screen brightness, browsing/using Word with no volume).\nThe touch screen and touch pad both work great. I haven't had any issues with either of these.\nSound quality is very good. The display is beautiful.\n\nThis laptop also has quite a bit of horsepower. It can process quite a few programs at once, and it boots up quickly. I'm always too lazy to close unused programs, and this laptop has been pretty forgiving in that regard.

Keys are well-placed and easy to press.\n\nThis laptop isn't the best for gaming. It can run games, but not nearly as well as something you'd get from a gaming laptop. I don't use it for gaming, so that's fine. If this laptop were $1500, I wouldn't question it. You're really getting a lot of bang for your buck here in terms of specs.

Considering the price tag, I expected it be pretty decent, however, I have had problems with this Dell literally from the beginning.\n\nFrom the first time I booted up, I was presented with a screen stating \"AC POWER ADAPTER WATTAGE AND TYPE CANNOT BE DETERMINED.\" Despite this, the laptop charged just fine, however, just two days later, the laptop will no longer charge, and when I hover over the battery icon, it says, \"(plugged in, not charging).\" When I check the BIOS at startup, it says AC Adapter type is \"UNKNOWN.\" I am using the same 45W Dell AC adapter that came with the computer. The adapter appears to be in perfect condition, and the green LED light is on. I have tried plugging it in to different outlets in my home, and I receive the same result. I tried updating the BIOS. I used Dell's online diagnostic tool for hardware problems, as well as the diagnostic tool specifically for this AC charging problem, but no problems were detected.\n\nI emailed Dell's Tech support, detailing all of the information above, and they clearly did not read my email, because they asked me to do all of the things I already mentioned. They then told me I could send it back for repairs that will take 10-12 days to complete.\n\nWhat bothers me most about this, is that if you do a quick Google search regarding this AC adapter problem, you will immediately get results regarding Dell computers, so this is clearly a problem they are aware of. I did not spend $800 in order to receive a faulty product that the manufacturer is aware is faulty. I use this unit for schoolwork, and being without it for 12 days is an unreasonable expectation. At this point, I am debating whether I want to get it fixed or just send it back for a refund. I did not want a Dell to begin with, but this seemed like a good deal. I am now regretting that decision.",

                "review_body": "I was very excited to receive this 2 in 1 earlier this week! The quality and design or the machine seems sturdy and functional. Unfortunately the machine freezes regularly and i must constantly restart. Now the track pad doesn't work at all. I had worries when the computer arrived unprotected bouncing around a big box without any documentation and without a stylus. I suspect the seller sent a refurbished model.\n  \u2022\u2022 update \u2022\u2022\nI returned the first computer and bought the same model again from another seller. So glad I did!! Thankfully Amazon makes it so easy to return! The new one arrived with proper packaging, documentation and a stylus. The previous one was clearly used before. Th is one arrived with a clean install of Windows 10 and is working great. As mentioned in other reviews the bottom gets hot. I put something between the laptop and my lap so that's not too much of a concern. This is the perfect size to carry around is very sturdy. I am enjoying being able to easily switch to tablet mode.",

I have been using this PC during the past couple weeks for internet access, word processing, minor photo editing and low level game play.  The response time for these general tasks has been very good.  There have been no problems or errors, everything is running smoothly, and the noise level is almost non-existent limited to an occasional whirl of a small fan. I believe this computer will work well as a desktop computer but lacks sufficient graphics power to play any but the most basic 3d games,  and has insufficient CPU capacity to be used as a workstation for number crunching computer programs, but for an extremely small profile computer it works well.",

It appears to be well constructed, tight seams and smooth surfaces with even paint job.\n\nThere\u2019s a total of 8 USB-A ports, unfortunately not all are USB-3, only front 4 with single USB-C port along with 4 video outs which is a combination of 2 DP and 2 HDMI on back.\n\nCase cover is constructed of plastic with honeycomb pattern, not a fan as it makes cleaning harder, along with fan intake on top and side vents. Intake opening are fairly large and no removable mesh filter helping to keep particles out.\n\nWindows 11 setup did not go through normal out-of-box experience process, like selecting preferences or connecting to Wi-Fi network, it automatically sign in as administrator. Appreciate it did not come preinstalled with bloatware which is nice, unlike some other manufactures, just standard Microsoft junk.\n\nI\u2019m able to run all my applications without issue and even able to play older game like Mass Effect Legendary Edition at higher resolution. Noticed fan continuously spins up and down even when not working on anything intensive, like web browsing.\n\nMinor annoyance, not all USB-A ports being USB-3, there\u2019s no justification for having older USB-A ports.\n\nBe mindful, device is stuck with loaded BIOS as vendor doesn\u2019t appear to have website for support.",

                "review_body": "The computer  arrived on time and was well packaged. I purchased it to replace a 12-year-old i7 tower desktop. I immediately began to test its functionality: I partitioned the internal SSD to create a small disk for onboard files. Next, Updated the OS with version 22h2 and the latest BIOS with ease. Then,  I installed basic applications from my old i7. I added a 500 gb hdd and backed up the system. Next, I created a recovery DVD on my Blu-ray and made sure the computer would start from the recovery disk. Using a docking station, I was able to access both 1080p monitors through each usb-c  port. Naturally the 2 HDMI worked well also. I was even able to boot the computer using a 16gb usb 3.0 attached to the docking station. The computer had no issues recognizing the 8 TB external hard drive, DVD drive or usb jump-drive. The internal fan is quiet and  keeps the computer mildly warm.\nI have purchased 2 Gen-10 NUC's previously and they have been very reliable. I am looking forward to experiencing the advances this NUC 12 Pro provides.\nSee Photos, attached.",

I use this system to do CAD work (Fusion 360), circuit simulations, video editing and live OBS sessions with multiple cameras.  It works great.  I was previously using a Surface Studio, but it was having trouble keeping up with the video loads and did not play well with the monitor, though that could be the fault of the DisplayPort to HDMI adapter I was using.  The direct HDMI outputs of this NUC produce an excellent picture on the 4K monitor, even when viewing subtle shading changes that I could not easily see previously.\n\nI received the NUC, plugged in a keyboard, mouse, network cable,  and the 4K monitor and fired it up.  After a few minutes of updating Windows 11 to the current release level I was able to load in my software and get going.  I have had no problems whatsoever in loading lots of software and data and running multiple compute-intensive programs simultaneously.",

It's perfect for me and I  have had no problems whatsoever with this little cute computer (fist time I have considered a computer to be cute Lol).\n\nThank you Cathy!

You will need 2 micro DP to DP to hook up the monitors and also this is something to note, you will need a USB 2.0 extender if you plan on using a bluetooth mouse directly into the PC. I contacted Intel on this one, for some reason the USB 3.0 ports are not shielded and create interference with bluetooth dongle. The extender just places the dongle at a distance far enough away so that the EMF of the port doesn't interfere. Another way around this is to connect the dongle into your monitor and run a USB out from the monitor into the PC.",

                "review_body": "Nice little device that cleanly replaces a traditional bulky and noisy mini-tower computer. I chose this particular NUC5I5MYHE model specifically because of the dual Mini Display Ports as all my computers have a dual 19\" 4:3 monitor configuration.\n\nIn addition to the base NUC unit, I purchased the Crucial 8Gb RAM kit (4GBx2 DDR3 1600 MT/s PC3 - 12800 CL11 SODIMM CT2KIT51264BF160B), a Samsung SSD (Samsung 850 EVO 250 GB M.2 MZ-N5E250BW) and Bluetooth/WiFi combo module (Intel 7265). Installation of these components wasn't difficult, especially if you have smaller hands. The one problem I ran into was that the units antenna wires that connect to the BT/WiFI 7265 module kept popping off due to their rigidity and routing within the enclosure.\n\nAll said and done, the hardware (NUC+RAM+SSD+BT-WiFi module) cost $584 dollars (plus OS software of your choice) -- that isn't any less costly than a traditional desktop (mini tower) computer, so you should only consider the NUC if you're looking for small form factor and quiet operation.\n\nI chose to install Windows 7 64-bit. On the OS/software side, the only problem I encountered was that the Bluetooth driver and software stack wouldn't work properly with my Apple bluetooth keyboard and/or Microsoft bluetooth mouse -- not until I upgraded the BIOS. On a side note, finding the proper drivers and BIOS file are a bit of a pain with Intel's site -- Intel could really benefit by learning from other tech giants when it comes to implementing a simplified \"enter your device's model number or serial number and here are all the drivers and files you need\" approach.\n\nOn the plus side, the unit runs cool, quiet and the Intel i5 is fast enough for the non-gamer applications I use on a daily basis.\n\nI do have a few criticisms of the hardware design:\n\nThe first and biggest concern of the device's design is that there aren't enough USB ports. There are only two on the back and two on the front. I'd like to see at least four on the back for keyboard, mouse, scanner and cable to feed my monitor's integrated USB hub. The two ports on the front would then be sufficient for the occasional use of my external DVD and memory card reader.\n\nSpeaking of memory card reader, I've seen others post that it would be real nice to have a SD card slot integrated into the unit. I see this as a really nice to have, but not a need to have. For the $1.50 it would cost in parts, it would be nice to see it built in to future NUC units.\n\nAlso, why Intel located the audio output jack on the front of the unit doesn't make a lot of sense to me. Why isn't this on the back like a normal computer so that I can route and hide all my cables?\n\nLastly, the design of the power supply leaves a bit to be desired. The connector to the NUC is not locking, and for reason's unknown, the barrel connector is a right angle which doesn't make a lot of sense given that all other cables (USB, Enternet, display ports) exit straight out the back. More importantly, the 'brick' plugs directly to your outlet, rather than with a lead cable -- for me this was also a problem as my power strip will no longer fit under my desk with the NUC's power brick attached.\n\nAll-in-all, I'd buy one again and would recommend these to peers -- but I'd make sure the limitations outlined above wouldn't be a problem first.",

I will quite often have all of these apps up and running simultaneously with 15+ tabs open in Chrome. It never misses a beat.\n\nIf you want a tiny desktop computer, build yourself a NUC.",

                "review_body": "Surprisingly when I opened up the bottom cover my NUC had been fitted with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB M.2 SATA hard drive. I purchased the NUC 5 Pro series as a bare bones PC. Normally this means I would need to add Storage and memory (RAM). The options for storage M.2 SATA (B key) socket and a standard SATA socket and space for 2.5\" SSD.  I messaged the company because I felt it was the right thing to do and offered to exchange it for what I had payed for. They emailed me back and thanked me for letting them know but told me I could keep it. So I purchased a used barebones NUC 5 Pro for $175 and ended up getting a well built complete system. The new price without the RAM and storage is $499. You add in the price of buying the RAM and memory which that's another $130. So yes I am very happy.  The product it's self  didn't look used it came with the peel off plastic protection on top and the front buttons. There where no scratches or marks of any kind and the it operates well. The only thing I would like to see included is a mini DisplayPort cable or adapter. That is the only outputs. I ended up purchasing  a mini DisplayPort to HDMI adapter from the local Best Buy  for about $9 just so I could get it up and running and test it. Otherwise I have no complaints. Of course I thrilled that I got more than I ordered but the product itself is like new and does what it's supposed to do. It cam with the power cord and metal mounting bracket, as well as all the original paperwork that would come in a new boxed item. Then when I contacted the sellers they were quick to respond and seemed very kind. What more could someone ask for. I would have written the same kind of review if I had gotten just the product as I had ordered it because of it's quality.",

The back fan is the only one I can tell is correctly setup.\n1) your front 3 case find should ALWAYS be setup facing inward. Meaning they are all blowing fresh cool air into your case and over your motherboard and components.\n\n2) if you can, ALWAYS, mount your AIO liquid cooler radiator on the top of your case. (And here is where they messed up, they aren't creating a negative or positive pressure system, air will just find its way out of any tiny openeings) the way this is set up you will need your fans running at 100% just to fight against each other.\nAfter mounting your radiator to the ceiling you then mount your 3 fans for a 360mm so that the fans are blowing air through the radiator and out the top.\n3) Doing it this way cool air will.be brought into your case from the front 3 fans,, as the air passed over your motherboard and videocard its going to begin to warm up as it cools down your components. What does warm air do naturally? Warn air rises. Which is why you have your radiator fans set to pull that warm air up and through the radiator cooling the radiator down and then it's really gonna be warm air. Do you want that hot air being sucked into your case and blown over your motherboard? NO, that one exhaust fan in the back will have to work on 100% just like all the others as the fans fight each other against air pressure and gravity.\n\nIt's very simple when building a PC. Hot air always rises. Your radiator is going to get warm but not scalding hot. But you don't want any of the hot air from your radiator going back into your case, do you? I'd you do just get rid of the water cooler and put a fan on your cpu and let it blow hot air all over everything.\nThe warm air coming off the radiator will rise out the tip of your case on its own. That's why you attatch 3 fans to the bottom of it and have the fans blowing air UP not DOWN like these people have it doing.\n\nThe 3 fans will pull any air in your case that's warm and push it through your radiator and out the top of your case. The rear case fan is to help blow any left over warm air out of the case as well and to help pull the air blown in from your front fans right towards rhe radiator fans as it warms up when it cools your ram etc. Whatever warm air doesn't get blown out the top of your case will exhaust out the rear of your case.\nThat's how you set up proper cooling for your gaming pc.",

First it was well packed, with a large foam insert protecting the graphics card so it didn't get banged around during shipping. It started right up. Windows said it wasn't activated and it wasn't obvious how to do that, so a quick email to support resulted in a fast reply giving me the command to find the Windows product key which worked with activation.\n\nThe keys to a gaming machine are making sure it doesn't overheat but that cooling it doesn't generate a ton of fan noise. The Mek has eight fans in it - three at the front, one at the back, as well as two on the graphics card and two on the CPU liquid cooler. I've monitored temperatures during gameplay and GPU and all CPU cores run cool, maxing out at no more than 70C. The fans are relatively quiet and not noticeable above the usual volume of gameplay. So excellent cooling with low noise.\n\nFor expansion there are two open DIMM slots and two open PCIE slots, although one of them would put a PCIE card very close to the graphics card fan so it may not be the best choice.\n\nThe only minor con I've noticed is although there are a ton of USB ports, there is no USB C. This is a nit because USB A to C cables are readily available. Also it would be possible to add a cheap PCIE USB C card if necessary.\n\nIn summary I'm delighted with the Mek, and my one minor interaction with their support team was positive.",

Spent 53 minutes on the phone with a hard to understand rep only to have them send us a new charger. New charger arrives and not only does it not fix the problem, now the computer won't even turn on.  Looks like I'll be wasting more of my time on the phone again. Next time we will be purchasing another brand, most likely saving for an Apple. We hadn't purchased a Dell in about ten years and now I'm remembering why!!",

I don't abuse my electronics, in fact I used this maybe 2-3 times a week tops so it didn't get very heavy use at all. About 6 months in, I noticed a white line on the screen, similar to what you'd see if there was moisture damage. I only ever used this at home either in my bedroom or my living room, it was never near any source of moisture, and when I wasn't using it I kept it in a laptop case. It wasn't a huge issue since it didn't interfere with my usage of the laptop, but sill annoying. Now fast forward to about two weeks ago, when suddenly I get a message that the charger is plugged in, but not charging the laptop. Also the charger cable seemed a little loose, so I just assumed it was the charger going prematurely bad. I bought another charger, and to my disappointment got the same message, so it's obviously the laptop itself. I'm very disappointed that this thing lasted less than a year of less than moderate use. I have always loved Dell products, but this one was a major dud. What a waste of $400 :(",

The video quality is great in that HD looks like HD, however when viewing video -specifically a few amazon prime videos, the video does buffer and stutter occasionally, this is not an internet speed issue as I do not experience this with my desktop. But at this price range this is expected.For gaming, I've only tried league of legends and it maintains a constant 50-60 FPS on LOW settings. At medium to high settings it can drop as low as 20 fps during teamfights, but if you are just using for light gaming such as turn based or MOBAs, this pc does the job well.\n\nPros- back lit keyboard\nHD videos\nHigh brightness\nDecent volume Speakers\nBlutooth capabaility\nQUICK startup -less than 10 seconds\n\nCONS- stutters occasionally at 1080p videos\n-average battery life",

To not see it you have to change the background to something in that color range. Then, upon trying to hook up any sort of audio device, headphones or speakers, it wouldn't recognize them and would play through the laptop speakers anyway or would output to external speakers (never the headphones) with a loud buzzing/humming noise. I adjusted every possible audio configuration in the computer to try to get it to output to the externals, I updated and installed drivers, I checked the config of the built in Dell audio software and it was all fine. So, defective lcd, defective audio in/out. I proved this by connecting the laptop to a docking station and connected the same speakers and headphones through that to a usb port on the laptop (surprisingly not defective also...) and they worked exactly as they should've. Not even going to the bother of sending it back and trying for a new one, because I'm sure half of it won't work either. So I'll be fixing this one myself. Quite disappointed.",

The speed on it is great. Everything seems to run smoothly with absolutely no problems.

I didn't know what caused it, so it had to of been though...right?  Anyway,  because of my honesty of the screen breaking following his 'up sale' attempt at the start of our conversation, n he could no longer offer me the warranty that covered accidental damage as I had stated it was already broken.  Also had more issues with dell a year later when I discovered I could in fact still use the computer streamed to my tv using hdmi ( I had asked another dell agent how to do just that, and the tech guy told me it was impossible to setup without a working screen) .  However dell rep refused to give me the BIOS bypass code because I was past my original 1 year warranty unless I purchased another warranty plan for my laptop.\n\nSummarized,  Call Acer if you have any technical problems and if you dont get accidental forgiveness as part of your warranty.. skip it completely!!\nSince the 1 year warranty came with with my order of this laptop, I believe I am allowed to voice my experience on the products review as I am.",

The camera is placed at the screen's center but the keys are laid out with the touchpad to the left of center. I hate this design. I cannot naturally find my finger placement for the keys and have to look for placement every time I move my hand for the mouse. The keys are more flush than my last Dell which also makes it harder to feel the correct finger placement. So, for normal typing, the center of the keyboard is to the left of the screen and bottom platform. It is extremely frustrating and causes me to regularly type the wrong keys, grrrr. I hope this description makes since. I simply find the bottom platform and keyboard to be a very poor design for me.\nI have deducted 2 stars because not easily finding the correct keys, for a long time computer and keyboard user, is a major defect.

                "review_body": "I researched for weeks to find a laptop under $500 and I am so happy to find this specific model! Personally the most important spec for a laptop is the screen quality, especially the resolution. This is 1920x1080 which is true HD. Many people posted in forums that you cannot tell the difference between 1366 x 768 vs 1920x1080. People can be seriously WRONG! The picture quality between these two resolution is night and day! Which 15in screen, do not go below 1920x1080. When I watch Youtube videos at 1080, the picture is very crisp and detailed.\nIt is hard to find a 1080 screen for laptops under $500. This is one of the very few on the market. This laptop has 1tb hard drive with 8gb of RAM, which has plenty of power to do every day tasks. Keep in mind that it is not a gaming laptop.\nThe one best single upgrade is to change the drive to solid state drive, which will load anything at a lightening speeds. Stick with quality brand names such as Samsung(which comes with very important software to copy your original data including Windows into the new SSD). You also need USB 3.0 to SATA III Hard Drive Adapter Cable which costs arond $10.\nOne of the best laptops under $500!",

It's hard to find anything comparable for this price that also has the same screen resolution as this computer.  All comparisons under $500 didn't have the same screen resolution, or sacrificed some other aspect, like chip, or HD space.  I was a little worried given the price but after using it a bit, it's a very sturdy, practical, do-everything computer.  Obviously because of the price there some tradeoffs.  For example it's not the lightest notebook in it's class, but it's certainly not heavy at all.  It's slim and you could easily take it places without much trouble.  The main tradeoff at this price is that you're buying a standard HD, not solid state which means the HD spins and consumes more power, thus battery life won't be as good if you're a chronic road warrior, but it will last at a coffee shop or during a flight on full charge, especially if you manage the power settings appropriately.  The laptop also isn't jammed with bloat software, which I really appreciated.  If you're looking for a great basic laptop that can handle high intensity programs, graphics editing, or video, and are on a budget, you could do no better.",

Volume half way with only earbuds is fairly loud.  The keyboard is fantastic.  The keys have a great feel and I don't think I could be without an illuminated keyboard anymore.  All programs I've tried so far load fast and operate well, including Photoshop.  The touchscreen hasn't failed me yet although I don't plan on using it often.

I am very satisfied!\nI have info pop-ups every time I start the laptop with the booting time and i takes usually about 16-25 seconds to start Windows. This is pretty fast, you don't have to wait forever for the system to launch.\nWindows 10 is OK, but you have to get used to it first if you haven't used it before.\nThe screen itself is surprisingly big - I can easily watch movies or work with 2-3 files simultaneously. Love the fact that it's touchscreen, I was concerned at first that it might start to glitch with a course of time, but so far so good. You can just swipe through the long list or zoom in our out anything in a second. Very handy.\nThe keyboard is back lit, which is pretty neat. I think you have to pay like extra $30 in other models/brands if you want to enable this.\nMaybe the only thing that I would change is USB - it has only 1 USD 3.0 and 2 - 2.0. Personally, I don't see why they didn't installed all three 3.0, but that doesn't bother me that much. It is somewhat frustrating, since I do use devices which call for USB 3.0 and here I can't use them simultaneously, but once again - can't say that this is such a big deal... Can live with that.\nHighly recommend. I doubt that you'll be able to find similar specs for this price.",

As others have said, the keyboard and casing feels really cheap to the touch, the hood of the lid is thin and hollow it would seem as it gives very easily to the lightest touch (feels thin like milk jug plastic), and the keyboard is bowed slightly (like a photo that is too large for its frame seat and bows upwards) but as a laptop, it's good.  It zips along nicely.  Just came from a Lenovo that got me to a point that I want to smash it on the shop floor.  So, having a good responsive laptop again makes me very happy.  Only had it 2 days so far, but set-up was fairly easy (took some time to load up all the programs and apps I need; like office, box, amazon, etc, but that is normal.  One thing of note, have not been able to get the printers to add-on successfully.  They load up, show as ready, then no printing.  Have tried two HP color Laser Jet, and one Canon Ink Jet thus far.  I will update as I figure this out).  It boots fairly quickly and multitasks very well.  4 stars only because of the paper thin plastics used for the casing and keyboard.",

I bought this computer because I had always heard good things about Dell and this computer was reasonably priced.  The issues started as soon as i fired it up the first time.  The computer would not stay connected to the internet when using Wifi.  It would connect for a couple minutes and then somehow magically disconnect on its own.  The only way to reconnect was to disconnect in the connection center and then reconnect manually.  When we contacted Dell tech support they were adamant it was our Wifi equipment even though all of our other wireless devices connected without issue.  When they finally agreed to send it in for service it took weeks for them to process the order only to return it in exactly the same condition.  This was the first time I sent it in.\n\nThe computer seemed to work for about a week when I got it back but  then it started to have the same issues.  We contacted tech support again and they tried all the same \"corrective actions\" they tried the first time.  We spent hours on the phone with tech support trying everything to fix the issue.  The computer then started giving me the Blue Screen of Death, I didnt even know that was a thing anymore but there it was. We ended up sending it in again to get repaired. Again, it took weeks to \"fix\"\n\nWhen we fired up the computer this time, not only did the computer yet again fail to stay connected to Wifi, the audio jack no longer worked.  Again, after hours on the phone with tech support and them trying pointlessly to fix this remotely we were getting ready to just accept that we bought a piece of garbage and just deal with it.  That was until something failed internally on the computer and now it constantly beeps loudly and it cannot be stopped.  5 beeps over and over and over.  Wont stop.  I contacted dell and said I have had enough after almost a year of broken equipment, hours and hours on the phone with tech support and months of waiting for the computer to get back from their repairs, I finally had enough and requested a refund for what obviously is a piece of junk product and inept tech support.  Dell said they will not refund and again only offered to \"fix\" the computer again.\n\nThe one thing that Dell does great is give you the run around.  They will transfer you from customer support to tech support to the warranty department and then right back to customer support.  Rinse and repeat over and over and over.\n\nSave yourself a a huge headache.  Do not buy this Computer, in fact, i wouldn't recommend an Dell computers unless your looking for some sort of boat anchor.",

We use Kodi in my house for media I installed kodi and am able to easily watch everything on our NAS with ease, 1080p content looks great on it.\n\nThe laptop was up and running within a few minutes. The back-lit keyboard is nice as I spend a bit a time using it in bed after the hubby has went to sleep, so it's nice to be able to see what I'm doing instead of needing another light..\n\nThe touchpad is ok, but I don't really use it, I've always detested touchpads so I purchased a wireless mouse to go with this, and use it instead.\n\nThe touch screen is a nice addition though I suppose I could live without it if there wasn't one.\n\nThis laptop is not a gaming powerhouse, however I am able to easily use steam to stream any of the MMO's I play from my main gaming computer, it does handle that with ease. I might handle games better with a bit more memory than what it comes with, however I've not installed any, though from reading other reviews I see it is possible to take it up to 16 gigs instead of the 8 gigs it comes with.\n\nThis laptop is perfect for browsing the internet, using Microsoft office and watching and/or streaming media. It does all of those things extremely well.\n\nI skipped windows 8 and honestly I'm glad I did I think it would've soured my experience with Windows 10, which I actually (surprisingly to myself) really like.",

It has a few good points, I like the back-lit keyboard even though there's this slight weird bulge in the middle of the laptop there, it doesn't bother me personally but its there fyi. I think the touchpad is nice and decently big, actually really liked where they put the speakers. They are on the front of the laptop and I feel like it does a good job of projecting the sound out, especially when its sitting on a table. Much better than if they were on the bottom like a lot of other computers. The sound of the laptop is pretty decent in general.\nBut that's about where my compliments about the computer end. Right out of the box it was really slow and laggy and the video driver would crash all the time. I called Dell a few times and they tried to help but mostly would just try things that didn't work for hours and then give up and tell me they were done and to call back if anything else happened. The video driver Dell makes for the integrated graphics on Windows 10 is not very compatible. Recently I have downgraded to Windows 7 and it is noticeably better, but I am noticing more how much of it is the fault of a weak processor. It still lags a bit more when surfing the web and moderate stuff like that than I think is normal. Which led me to notice that this computer is telling me it has a weaker processor than they advertised it as. This computer has an i5-4210U 1.70GHz 2.40GHz, when Amazon has it listed as i5-4210U 2.20GHz 2.70GHz. I wish I had noticed sooner and would have returned, because I feel like its too slow honestly. I had to replace the charger before I even owned it a year, so that's one thing. The last major problem I have had with it is that the disk drive has never worked on this laptop. I didn't try to use it until after months of owning it but it wouldn't read disks and no amount of troubleshooting did anything. So Dell sent me a new one to install myself and I did easily, but the very first time I went to use it I put the disk in and then it never came back out and makes this horrible noise now when you puch the button to open the tray. They refused to send another and told me I had to package the computer with my own box and send it to them so I never got it fixed. I would maybe consider utilizing the space with a better hard drive if it did not have such a weak processor. I would get rid of it, but I am required to buy a Macbook for the school I'm transferring to so I can just keep this as extra storage and to watch Netflix. I doubt it would get anything for it if I sold it anyway.",

                "review_body": "Five years ago I spent three times as much to buy my wife a Dell laptop that has less than half the capabilities of this unit.  It is amazing how quickly technology has improved and prices have come down.  After doing a ton of research, which is normal for me, I settled on this unit to handle\nall of my computing needs while on the go.  It appears that I made a wise choice!\n\nI am not a \"gamer\" nor do I multitask or use spreadsheets, therefore my needs might be quite a bit less than  yours.  On the other hand, I always try to get a bit more product than I really need to hedge myself for potential applications in the future. My emphasis is on reliability, efficiency, and portability.\n\nEvery Dell computer I've ever owned has always performed as promised. In fact, the only other manufacturer I've tried is Gateway (once) and their product was also well made.  Any problems I've encountered over the years have either been caused by my own inexperience and/or could be\nrectified by a quick call to Dell Customer Support.  The performance and efficiency of this computer is limited only by the quality of the wi-fi available.  The slight delays and pauses of some wi-fi connections can be maddening but are not the fault of the computer.\n\nAs far as portability, this is far lighter and thinner than my wife's prior Dell 15.6\" laptop. I considered a smaller screen but my older eyes appreciate a larger screen and carrying this unit around with you is simple if you use the Amazon Basics Laptop sleeve.  Anything larger than an iphone 6+ requires something other than a pocket to transport it so it's really not a hardship to have a larger screen to carry.\n\nThe product description will provide you with all the information you need concerning storage, speed, ports, and functions.  The screen is exceptionally clear, the sound is acceptable (use headphones for best performance) the keyboard is familiar, has the right haptic feel (for me) and is backlit for easier night time use. The unit overall looks well made and is strongly and attractively constructed.  It is everything that you have come to expect from a Dell computer.",

                "review_body": "The worst laptop I've ever encountered.  Hardware is so cheap and brittle that it begins falling apart from top to bottom within a year.  THIS IS A DISPOSABLE LAPTOP.  Failure begins quickly and accelerates from there.\n\n1.  Space Key Nonfunctional:  The space key is incredibly unresponsive.  I'm a touch-typist.  With the Inspirion, I type a paragraph, then find half the words ran together because the space key didn't work.  Not a problem with any other computer I've ever used.\n\n2.  Touchpad:  The touchpad on the Inspiron is one of those unified pieces with both the right-click and left-click buttons integrated into a single unit.  This frequently results in right-clicking when you meant to left-click.  It also takes major effort to do the click -- probably twice as much pressure as old Lenovo G50.  A set-up for repetitive stress injury, particularly tendonitis of the elbow.  (Ask me how I know.)\n\n3.  Windows 10:  No improvement over the functionality of Windows XP or Windows 7.\n\n4.  Processing Speed:  Good.  The Intel I5 processor is fast -- the only good part of the Inspirion.\n\n5.  Screen:  The screen is bright and clear.  The touchscreen function works, although it has one enormous defect (see below).\n\n6.  Wifi Connection:  Weak!  I can't go far from my Wifi router with the Inspirion.  The Wifi connection simply cuts out at distances where my other devices have no problem maintaining a connection.\n\n7.  Touchscreen Defect:  The frame around the touchscreen is so thin and fragile that if you apply even slight pressure to the upper right hand corner of the frame, it will depress the \"X\" on an open Internet window and close out your browser.\n\nI gave the Inspirion one star because of the nonfunctional space key and injury-inducing touchpad.  These defects taint every interaction I have with the laptop.\n\nUpdate 1/1/2017:  After many months with the Inspirion, my experience has gotten worse.  There is now a weird glitch where the icons in the lower right hand corner of the screen (sound, power, wifi signal, time and date) start flashing in and out, the cursor goes haywire, and the touchscreen acts like I'm pressing it in random places even though my hands are still on the keyboard.  The haywire cursor will even close me out of open browser sessions involuntarily.\n\nI am current on updates from Microsoft and my Norton security scans show no viruses.  This appears to be a glitch unique to the Inspirion.  I am pretty sure I will never purchase another Dell product.  This Inspirion has been a huge disappointment.\n\nUpdate 2/14/2017:  Just when I thought this laptop couldn't get worse....\n\n1.  Now the adapter plug (the part that inserts into the laptop) has become so loose that it randomly loses the electrical connection and stops charging while inserted.  I think it's charging, only to find the battery has run down.  ARGH!\n\n2.  Windows 10 glitches the printer drivers for my HP printer.  When I print a document, a \"ghost\" of the document remains stuck in the queue with an error message, preventing anything else from printing.  Sometimes Windows lets me delete the document, but most of the time it either won't delete at all or takes 30 minutes or so to delete.  Now, routine printing of multiple documents is an enormous hassle.  (And it's not the drivers -- I've re-downloaded them directly from HP.\n\nUpdate 6/12/17:  Two new problems:\n\n1.  Brittle Frame:  The plastic from which the bottom frame is made is so flimsy and brittle that the lower left hand corner is cracking around the USB ports.  I haven't dropped the machine or done anything rough with it.  The frame is simply falling apart from normal, gentle use.\n\n2.  Display Cable Defect:  The screen often flashes vertical colored lines for extended periods, rendering it useless.  I've read that this machine has defective display cables that cause this problem.  I've attached clamps on both sides of the screen because depressing those areas seems to help.  But what a RIDICULOUS thing to have to do to a laptop that is less than two years old!\n\nUpdate 7/31/17:  The HDMI port is no longer working.  I insert the HDMI cable for my second screen and get ... blackness.  It usually lasts a couple of minutes, then the screen will start flashing on and off or give me a \"no signal input\" message.  Eventually, the connection somehow stabilizes and I get a normal screen.\n\nThere is literally nothing hardware-related that has not gone wrong with this laptop.  It is the crappiest computer I've ever seen, much less owned.\n\n*****I CAN'T SAY IT ANY MORE STRONGLY:  DON'T BUY THIS LAPTOP.  DON'T BUY THIS LAPTOP.  DON'T BUY THIS LAPTOP.****",

                "review_body": "I've had this computer for nearly 4 years now and I've gotten very close with it in that time. It isn't the best for gaming, I can't even run a few games on the lowest quality settings. The screen is high quality, but you will notice bright spots around the edges when the screen is dark but still in use. The touch screen had this problem where it would activate with nothing touching it so I just turned it off permanently. The track pad is responsive and works very well, and the keyboard is back lit and sensitive. The battery on my laptop randomly started malfunctioning and did not hold a charge and any time it was plugged into the computer it would freak out and start flashing lights rapidly. There is a small spot where some pixels have died but I cannot even see it unless the screen is totally dark. A screw stripped out of its hole and I have to tape my laptop together on the corner where the hinge is because of that. Not a lot of RAM, and the CPU gets used up pretty quickly, but it is still a fast and reliable computer with a great value for its price point and I use it every day. Perfect if you want a laptop that will run low-intensity games that don't require a good graphics card. The Sims 4 works fine on low settings, OSU plays well- with occasional lag, some games are for some reason nearly unplayable if they access the internet to load up (steam games) which I experienced with Firewatch and The Long Dark. Even despite my issues with the laptop I really do love and am happy with my purchase and see myself continuing to use it for several more years to come!",

                "review_body": "First of all, this is a GREAT computer.  It's only hampered by running Windows 10, which CONSTANTLY is updating, and on the traditional disk drive here, it's very slow for updates.  The drive is 1 TB, so there's tons of space.  But it's so slow that it takes hours to manage Windows updates.  And that's not even mentioning that some Windows updates in the past have caused massive problems like lost files, never to be recovered.  It's very strange.  If this were a Chromebook, it would be a beast.  But I got it for the DVD/CD thing to transfer files from DVD/CD and to play games.  It actually can play games.  I ran Fallout 3 at around 30 FPS.  Sometimes dipping to 20s, but I certainly could play the game and have fun - it was similar to a Playstation 3 experience of the game.  So it can do that.  The display is fantastic and I never used the touch screen.  Also, the keyboard is the worst keyboard I have ever used in my life.",

                "review_body": "I have purchased two dozen computers or more in the past two decades but this one is right up there with the very best of them.\n\nIt took me a month to decide on a new computer for a new business I am launching and I decided that, short of switching to Apple, Dell has the best reviews in laptops.\n\nThe price was unbelievable, this model has everything I wanted and no bloat-ware (so happy never to see McAfee again, ever!). I especially love the action on the keyboard. The entire surface is some sort of velvety rubber-like material that is comfortable and does not show fingerprints. The keys have the right amount of firm \"crunch\", and the backlit feature works beautifully. I don't mind it going off to conserve energy -- the minute you touch any key, it comes back. Genius.\n\nThe outer shell is beautiful too with a corduroy-like finish that will resist marks and scratches. The whole unit feels substantial for a laptop (and I have had many that were either too heavy or too flimsy, in the past).\n\nSetup was effortless. Literally plug and play simple. I am no techie and really appreciated that. It did take some effort to find the place to register (I just went to the Dell main page and found it there), and I think that should be more evident in the apps or somewhere more intuitive, but that was the only drawback to getting the unit up and running.\n\nWith a few keystrokes, I synced it to my other Windows Desktops and now I can move to any of them and work seamlessly.\n\nWith one Terabyte of HD, I can download beefy software and keep data on a thumb-drive. The RAM is perfect and the processor enables fast loading of sites and software.\n\nThe best for last: I do a lot of artistic photography work and the resolution on this computer is exceptional. Brilliant, beautiful screen display. I don't find the gloss finish distracting nor is there too much glare, so I don't intend to add a filter over it.\n\nThe perfect computer. Let's face it, we don't hold onto computers for a decade any more. Most of us have to get new ones at least every few years. However, this one seems destined to last for more than most and I can see already that I will be quite attached to it.",

                "review_body": "As a long-time Mac user and a very, very reluctant Windows user, I have to say I could almost switch back to Windows based on my experience with  this Dell laptop. I was a bit worried as the whole sum of instructions consists of a five panel pamphlet about the size of a CD and mostly pictures and not words. As I was girding myself for the interminable suffering of online search for anticipated help needs because it's Windows, and rearranging my schedule in my head to carve out the time, this little Dell quietly finished the set-up and was ready to begin. Dell really did their homework and made this crazy easy right out of the box.\n\nThis laptop comes pre-installed with Windows 10, which for many may be a deal-breaker, but I found I was able to get going and navigate around the OS immediately and with extreme ease. Having read the reviews and rants, and this being my first go-around with Windows 10, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it. I easily installed some apps, got them onto the task bar and home screen (or whatever it's called) and once the housekeeping was done (connecting to the WiFi network, printers, other devices, etc.), I was off and running.\n\nThe keyboard is just the right set of responsiveness, not too touchy nor does it require a firm press. And for a laptop, the keys are spaced well enough for my hands. Someone with large hands may find it too cramped, but hey, it's a laptop and you can always plug in an external keyboard.\n\nIt's lightweight and slim enough to easily tote around all day, and indeed it did not become a horrible burden on my shoulder during a recent business trip. It starts up quickly, runs smoothly and quietly. The built-in speakers are pretty decent and getting the laptop to pair via bluetooth was a snap (like it is on the Mac). The screen is gorgeous, truly gorgeous. I was bowled over at the crisp clarity and brilliance of color. In the hotel room I really put it to the test (you know, that horrible laggy hotel Internet speed) and watched an episode of a show through Amazon Prime and whoa, it was like watching a high quality HD TV. Yes, there was some lag because I refuse to pay the $20 per day for the \"premium\" Internet service, but nowhere near as bad as with my older Mac laptop. The next day as I whisked through a PowerPoint presentation, several people caught the view from my screen and almost immediately the meeting went from an artfully arranged agenda to playtime with my new Dell. After fawning all over it, the price tag question came up and upon learning the price, everyone went nuts.\n\nThere are plenty of really good reviews about the technical specs, but if you are looking for a solid laptop for business and/or student use, this is an amazing value!! I still love my Mac, but my little Dell has earned a coveted spot on my desk too!",

It's truly ridiculous that the system files just by themselves can fill almost 30 GB, but according to the error messages this is what the problem was. I attempted many troubleshooting methods and none worked even to the point of buying a 2TB external hard drive. None of this resolved the issue.

It almost took a full minute to even open the control panel. The responsiveness of the screen was not much better. It was painfully slow or inconsistent. I eventually deleted all the bloatware and that has helped. However, despite the low price point and specs I at least expected it to be usuable to light web browsing and using google docs which was practically impossible straight from the box. Overall, would not purchase this again but not unhappy enough to return it.",

Ok quality, can't change default function keys, it ran at max temp for the first month, and now 2 months later the touchscreen has errors and registers several not real inputs, then shuts down, depending on screen position. Will not buy another. Will not recommend MSI products. Used only lightly for personal home / streaming use.\n\n8 month Update. Over all needed to return 3 times for touchscreen issues, each time being repaired, then lasting ~2 months before failing again. After the third failure I received a new unit, (different S/N) to which I am going to sell second hand as NIB. Quality of the device was over all ok for ~$1400. Still the device runs hot, uncomfortably on a lap. Speakers are worse then my 10yr old Lenovo Yoga, and the battery life while browsing and streaming is good for ~5 hrs. Overall disappointed, but I will raise to 2 stars as the exchanges and returns for warranty where very easy, and MSI covered it all no questions asked, usually only taking 6-8 days.",

                "review_body": "We bought this laptop back in November of 2022, and go figure it breaks just after the one year warranty expires!\n\nThis laptop was pretty nice for what it packed into a small package.  Sweet features with the touchscreen, fingerprint unlock, 32gb RAM.  But it just did not last.  We used this laptop lightly for travel/personal use and never abused it.\nIt started having an issue where the mouse pointer would jump to a certain spot on the screen, and then dance back and forth.  The pointer changing to a sort of crosshair look.  This problem started to happen more and more frequently and now the laptop cannot be used for more than 2-3 minutes without it happening.  Tried various forms of troubleshooting and after finally taking it in the problem is apparently the motherboard.  MSI offered to fix it... for more than the cost of the entire laptop.  This has been extremely disappointing as the issue is from the parts used to build this machine and MSI wont take any responsibility for it because the warranty just expired.\n\nOverall this experience has decidedly made us unlikely to ever purchase an MSI product again.",

                "review_body": "Bought my first Asus laptop in January 2012, and it has served me well. I still have it and everything still works, but it likely needs a new battery (only stays on when plugged in), and is running Windows 7 so I figured it was time to finally upgrade. It still starts up in under 30 second, runs quick, and does all I need it to do, but having to tape the cord to the port is a little too far in the trenches for me. Hahaha!! Although I am getting a warranty extension for submitting this review, it is definitely not in any way motivated by the incentive, as I had already made up my mind that it was going to be Asus or nothing when I started my search. The laptop is BEAUTIFUL! The screen is a great size at 16\", and it is so slim that carrying it around all day is no biggie. I am a real estate agent so being able to work on the go is essential (one of the reasons I knew I needed to upgrade), and this checks all the boxes. Harmon Kardon speakers give great quality sound while I'm listening to my music and the speed makes my daily work tasks a breeze. The ONLY thing I don't like is the placement of the 0 on the 10-key numeric pad, but that is something that can easily be forgotten once I get used to using it more. Since I bought my original Asus in 2012, my siblings and parents have gone through 2 Macbooks, 2 Chromebooks, and a Lenovo that have all conked out after a few short years (I don't think any of them made it to their 5th birthday. haha!). The price is definitely nothing to wince at, and luckily I caught it on sale, but remember that YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR. A $300 computer may seem like the way to go, but why do that to yourself when you'll be back in 3 years looking for a replacement? Asus has stood the test of time and I will not ever purchase any other brand. To me, they are truly top tier. Don't just buy a laptop; INVEST in one...THIS one!",

At this time I have not yet tried to install through the computer or go any further. I've simply stopped after reading the troubleshooting for installing app which involves checking some settings and what not.\n\nOtherwise the product seems nice. Best for probably ages 3 or 4 and up. Those who can follow instructions and are closer to understanding and mastering preschool teachings and concepts. Not as much protection as you may expect or want when paying such for a little ones entertainment so I would recommend buying any additional case/cover or whatever you can (don't forget the screen protector).\n\nNot a big choice in colors but we got the bluish teal and it's mostly a pretty summer bright ocean aqua, mixed right down the middle, not more blue not more green but nice and better for a girl I think but we got for a boy. Still nice.\n\nI think once I get the applications on it will be fine. My son is only 2 and doesn't use it very well but can still color/draw and play silly games like the Ant Smasher. Of course if I wasn't having problems installing apps I could tell you what else is there but since it uses Android you can just search here through Amazon for apps. I LOVE Android ad will stay with them.\n\nSo overall I would recommend this. Even my 7 year old enjoys it. Games for all ages... including adults!! ??",

                "review_body": "Anyone considering this tablet needs to know that this is the VERY FIRST version of the Funtab. There has been a Funtab 2 and the newest is the Funtab 3. This first version is very inferior to the new Funtab 3. And guess what, it costs $30 to $40 more! This very outdated version only has Android 4.2 and a very small 8GB of storage. And the newer Funtab 3 has Google Play Store which is FAR superior to the very limited Amazon App store that charges money for many of the same apps on GPS that are FREE. The newer F3 has Android 5.1 which is a much more efficient operating system that gives longer battery life for one thing. It also has twice as much storage at 16GB. So you can add a lot more free games from Google Play Store. Not that you'll even need to for a long time. This tablet has SO many great games your kid will be entertained for many months. And not just entertained, but LEARNING. Nearly every game on this tablet teaches something valuable. As a tablet seller for many years I can highly recommend this tablet (Funtab 3) as the best tablet on the market for ages 2-5. Even better than a Leapfrog? Yep! Leapfrog is great for ages 3-9. But for strictly preschool kids nothing beats this tablet. It's a steal at $50-$60. But do yourself a favor and buy it brand new, not used or refurbished. The price difference is only about 5 or 10 bucks. Many tablet dealers sell used or refurbished that are actually store returns and all you're getting are someone else's problems. Two other tips.....get a screen protector right away. You need all the protection you can get with kids. And don't let kids charge it. They'll ruin the delicate charging port. If it stops charging, first thing is try a new USB cable. At least half the time that's the problem. And if you happen to get a bad tablet make sure you exchange it for another right away. Remember....Funtab 3.",

Using zoom with this computer will leave you looking like a grey grainy mess, which in the current climate, means this computer is not really appropriate for anyone. Beyond that failing though, the exterior of the is awful. The edges of the base are rough and sharp in places. I end up with red marks on my lower arms and wrists after just a few minutes of typing from rubbing against them. The touch pad is also very loose, and the press locations are finicky, very hard to hold and move something, or do any sort of advanced maneuvers other than basic clicking, which even that requires precision.\n\nOverall I regret my purchase.

Then I started personalizing it, it won't allow you to add Chrome. In the other posts it says you can call tech support but I did not. The computer just for browsing was awful. Just to click you have to click multiple times because it doesn't sense it right away and when it does it clicks on other things. I wanted to like this computer but it feels very cheaply made. I had to send it back after only two days. I never even got a chance to use for school because it is set up akward. I only checked emails. Not user friendly in my opinion.

This was a perfect laptop for her first few years of college; she's a graphic design major so she was able to really test its limits. It was very easy for her to carry around in her bag to her classes. Performance-wise, it struggled a bit with more demanding programs like Source Film Maker and Photoshop but was still able to pull through in the end. The laptop showed signs of giving up after pushing it so hard with the programs her classes required, but she was able to trade it in for a new one in 2022. All in all, both of us were satisfied!",

CPU is both underpowered at 80W PL2 vs Intel's required 115W to achieve 4.7Ghz AND under-cooled causing the processor package to reach 95C at a mere 4.2Ghz and throttle down to 3.8Ghz or lower each time due to poor cooling system thermodynamics. Meaning: as tested, this laptop performs in the bottom 8th percentile of all other laptops with the same CPU across more than 1000 tests.\n\n2. The RAM is timed with a very high latency. As configured and tested, the LPDDR5 16GB memory package performs slower than 5 year old DDR4 memory. Samsung supports XMP 3 for their DDR5 with better timings and latency, but Asus has chosen to not implement to specifications again, resulting in poor memory performance.\n\n3. The A370m GPU leaves much to be desired. In short, it will aid low demand creative applications but you can forget about 3D gaming and demanding creative suites.\n\nAside from that, the screen is beautiful and bright, SSD performance is up to mark, keyboard is nice for a laptop/notebook, and the battery is great.\n\nIn general, there are a handful of choices with the same or better specs that outperform this model. Asus has impressed us with the specifications but tricked us with the reality of experience and performance.\n\nBuy something else...",

                "review_body": "The laptop comes (mine at least) with pre-installed Windows 10 21H2. This is an out of support version of Windows 10 and is out of service for a couple of months.\nMore than that, the OS comes with a dozen of HP drivers missing for critical devices like wifi card. This means that out of the box there will be no network/internet connection once the computer is turned on. Of course it still has a RJ45 port, but I am sure that 90% of people don't have wired network at home. So you will have to download the required driver from HP site to another computer, copy it to a flash drive and then install it from the flash drive on the laptop. You have no idea which exactly driver you will need because on HP site there is driver for Intel wifi card, for MediaTek card and for Qualcomm card. You will need to try all of them in order to find the correct one. Once installed successfully, you can finally connect the laptop to the internet and download all the missing drivers and Windows updates. Note that before updates for Windows are installed, the computer is vulnerable due to very old version used as mentioned above. Well, I installed Windows 11 and it, BTW, has built in driver for the wifi card used in this computer.\n\nAnd now the real problem. The battery is really worn out. The spec suggests capacity of 45Wh, but the actual capacity is 36Wh. This means that the battery is 20% less than a new one. Dear seller, this is not what I call _fully functional, and in excellent condition_. This is not properly tested and definitely not in excellent condition. I personally would prefer a couple of scratches to a worn out battery.\n\nThe good: the laptop is lightweight, good size for a kid's school computer and the screen is acceptable.\n\nAddition: despite the description, the laptop does not have fingerprint sensor. I see that this was already stated in other reviews, but the vendor did not even update the item description. [Palmface]",

First time setting up windows, it asks for your windows password - which is not your personal password. It will make you think it\u2019s looking for an admin password and that you have to contact the refurbisher - but you don\u2019t. There is no password. Leave it blank and hit enter as though you\u2019ve put in a password.\n\nAmazon refurbished support didn\u2019t know that when I called them.

This refurbished unit was in perfect condition. It was supposed to have a fingerprint reader but I contacted the vendor and discovered that they had been misinformed. They rapidly rectified the issue in days with just a couple emails.\n\nThe computer itself was clean, the display is delightfully clear and bright. The AMD Ryzen CPU is more than twice as fast as the machine it replaces. It has run everything I need with plenty of headroom (typically running less than 6% CPU. The NvME SSD is blazing fast.) The 16 gigabytes of RAM is provided by two SoDIMM which allows dual-channel, interleaved access making it even a little faster. I've used it on an external monitor and gotten great 4K results at 60 Hertz. This was a great bargain. Plus, the vendor support was excellent.\n\nI want to call out the specs on this again. AMD has an excellent line of CPUs and are comparable to Intel's latest generation. The construction of the ProBook follows the same frame design as the EliteBook which is the top of the line business machine, with fewer ports. It would be hard to match this for anywhere near this price. I've used other Amazon refurb products and been pleased at the value. Unless you're looking for the fastest gaming machine this will service any normal home or business user.",

However, the fans, clock speeds, and voltages are locked so neither overclocking nor undervolting will be possible.\n\nWhen stress-testing on Cinebench R15, the laptop's thermals are way too weak for sustaining the 4.1 Ghz CPU turbo (activates below 70 degree Celsius), but it's good enough to sustain the 3.2 Ghz turbo during which the CPU never exceeds 85 degrees. The Vega 7 integrated GPU is also good enough to run Sekiro on medium graphics, so I believe its got enough strength to run most games.",

Reviewers have criticized its mediocre brightness but the sheer screen \"real estate\" and the feather light weight are the most important factors for a mobile laptop that's easy on the eyes.  However, models begin at around $1000, and progress up to $2000 ish.\n\nAnother option is the highly rated Dell XPS with hit UHD display.

                "review_body": "So this computer is perfect for someone like me who uses it primarily for work and very little for play. It's my first with a solid state drive (SSD). Much quicker than my old Sony Vaio with the old outdated hard drive, which was a $1,200 flagship model approaching 10 years old. SSD uses less energy because it has no moving parts and is more suited for the bumpy life of a laptop. This also has wicked fast 3.2 USB ports. About 10x faster when using jump drives that are rated 3.0 or above. This means I an easily use an external drive without the lag if I need more memory in the future. I see some complained in the reviews about the screen quality. Keep in mind this is an anti-glare sceen. If you are not familiar with this type of screen expect something different. They do look different and are easier on the eyes when working for long periods of time. If you are use to bright crisp screens and eye strain, look elsewhere. This screen also has some privacy qualities because it's harder to see from the side. Another plus is there is are no preinstalled obnoxious programs. Does have a week long trial for windows 365. There is no fingerprint scan. Had some issues with the last one so I see fingerprint readers as one more thing to malfunction while trying access your computer. No touchscreen. Almost never used it on my Vaio. I use the voice commands more. One thing I would like to have seen is a USB C connection, the reason why I knocked it down a star. USB C is the future and Lenovo dropped the ball big time on this one. Has one port for a regular 2.0 USB, two 3.2 USBs (souch faster), HDMI, a card reader, and a headset/microphone jack. The internet connection via wifi is great. Bluetooth also works great as I use it for an external speaker. The speakers on the computer are a little disappointing. Okay for regular function, not great for music. With a 12 gig ram and a solid state drive there is no lag with data transfers and it starts up quickly. Haven't fully tested the battery, but it lasted 5 hours on my last use. This is a nice computer with up to date drive technology and no fluff that I wouldn't use anyway.",

If you do your settings for privacy and not sync with other devices, if not needed, it really helps with speed and connection with internet.  Either or, it still is very, very fast.  It sits perfectly on my lap unlike other laptops I have had that were too bulky and very heavy.  I feel happy and satisfied, knowing I can get online with a reliable computer.  I waited a few weeks before rating, definitely 5 star for me.\nGreat product.",

Yet, it is impossible to hold it, either in portrait or landscape, without accidentally touching the screen or the physical home/back/task buttons. If you hold it in portrait, the edges available for you to hold is so tiny that you touch the screen all the time. If you hold it in landscape, you will keep pressing the back button accidentally.\n\nThe multiple-window feature is marginally useful. But having it activated by a in-bound swipe from the right edge is simply crazy. There are so many apps who use the same gesture to turn pages. I have to disable this feature immediately.\n\nAnd I expected a tablet with 1.9GHz quadcore cpu to be fast and smooth. On the contrary, it's not fast at all when I scroll between pages of my kindle ebooks. Much slower than my nexus 5 cell phone.\n\nThe only thing nice about it is the screen.

Unfortunately the damn thing has a pretty annoying glitch. I looked it up online and apparently a few of these tablets have faulty wiring in the battery When it's not fully charged (or charging) it tends to flicker and then freeze and then restart. I didn't think much of it at first (I'm pretty thick skinned and patient) but it soon became INCREDIBLY annoying. It had gotten to the point where I had to leave the thing charged 24/7 or else it would flicker and then freeze and then restart. I highly suggest you invest in the Galaxy Tab 4 8 inch. It works just the same and the battery isn't all the way bad. This tablet isn't worth +200 dollars. It isn't even worth the metal it took to make it.",

I hated Touch Wiz, so I downloaded Google Now launcher, which is a big improvement. The battery life, however, is the achilles heel of this tablet.  If I use the tablet fairly regularly, I only get 3-4 hours out of the charge.  For example, today after playing a game for 30 minutes (Two Dots), the battery went from fully charged to 70%.  I was down to 7% by noon (3.5 hours of use).  Having had Nexus 7 2012 and 2013 versions, both of which had decent batteries, this is unacceptable.  As far as settings, the battery software says that the screen is using 50% of my juice.  However, I have it set on automatic, which keeps brightness to a minimum.\n\nIf I could go back, I would NOT purchase this tablet.

Very inconsistent, I use this for my alarm clock, but I can't trust it like this, and it's very annoying when it shuts off in the middle of a game!!\nI can buy a replacement battery kit, but it's $65.00. Kinda high when this is less than 6 months old!!",

What is annoying is the wifi will lose connection every few days and we have to restart the tablet. Keep in mind we have iPads, a Windows tablet, a Macbook, and two iPhones that connect and reconnect to wifi with no problems. So I do not believe this problem to be related to our router, but rather the tablet.  The other annoyance are the touch buttons at the bottom. Fine with holding it in portrait mode, but turn it to landscape and unless you're super careful you'll be hitting those buttons. Especially if you have any younger kids using the tablet, it is practically unusable in landscape mode for younger kids, and challenging for older kids and adults.",

It's lightweight, very thin, and has the ability for me to add on a smart card to increase the 16GB hard drive space if that proves necessary in the future. Using it for reading and watching videos and movies in tight airplane seats and while waiting for flights is fantastic.

The power down issue is not the real problem, but rather the use of Chromecast to control and cast Youtube clips to a TV. Samsung rep reported to me that \"Chromecast is not compatible with your device\". Bummed isnt the word I'd like to use. Would be 5 stars without that issue. If you dont want to use Chromecast, you can prolly be satisified with this device. It is responsive and light enough for me and I am somewhat of a geek. The battery capactity and weight tradeoffs seem ideal. You can google the chromecast issue for this device as a Google search. It is common enough. Earlier, folks report that Samsung said it was a Google issue.  Now I was told that it is simply not compatible.  Good thing to find out after the purchase ???",

One maddening error made by Samsung is the fact the tablet won't stop going into store 'demo' mode.  Checking the forums, other tablet owners are experiencing the same thing. I think this is the major draw on the  crappiest battery life, cause the demo does its thing generally ignoring your settings. Being constantly reminded of how great the screen is is like the tablet screaming 'marco-polo' every time you put it down!  Unless you put the tablet in battery saving mode, which is an extra step each time you put it down, which means you have to take it out the 'mode' each time also. The tablet tends to hiccup as it goes back to full function  I am hoping the android 5.0 upgrade takes care of this issue.  I will continue to check the forums...until then.",

I've had it for almost a month, and I still like watching the 4K sample video that comes preloaded just because its so stinking pretty.\n\nOther than the gorgeous display... this thing is a feather in size and weight.  It blows the iPad mini out of the water in how light and comfy it feels.  Much easier to hold in one hand as well.\n\nIt's lightning fast at anything I've tried to run with it, all the way up to 4K video.\n\nAnd because its such an important feature to me... I have to state that I LOVE the microSD card slot... I added 64BG of memory to mine and have all the space I think I could want.\n\nIt took a little getting used to the \"Menu\" button being gone and being replaced with the \"recent apps\" button.  However, after a slight adjustment... I'm finding that in general I like it better.",

However,  recently,  it has started to show the \"black screen of death\" without any warning.  Once this happens the entire tablet is frozen and I can't even restart it. This is happening more and more frequently.  Apparently I cannot request a replacement for this 8 month old tablet, nor can I afford to pay to replace it.  It's never been dropped,  has been extremely well taken care of.  To say that I'm devastated that a quality product from Samsung is showing performance issues at such an early stage would be an understatement.  I honestly don't know what to do.  I  believe that for the price we paid I deserve to have it replaced,  but I doubt that will occur.",

I was really excited to own this item because I did my research at the time and I wanted a tablet that wasn't too small or too big, thin & can fit in my purse as well as a rectangle not a square. I wanted it to be the size of a page in a normal size textbook because I was still at University at the time. The 7in. was too small for my needs and the 10in+ was too big.\n\nHOWEVER, I purchased a new one at Walmart in November 2014 nearing the thanksgiving sales so I got quite the discount on it. I have to say that product-wise, I love my tablet and it's going to be almost 2 years since I initially purchased mine. I highly enjoy mine and I can't bring myself to try the newer tablets by Samsung because I like this one so much. I will definitely be heartbroken when this one decides to break down on me!",

Because I have a Galaxy4 phone, I was familiar with the operating system.  I had it up and running in no time.  I got a great deal on the Dazzling White one, $50 less than the Titanium colored one. The only big disappointment for me is the fact that I cannot view Amazon Prime Instant videos on this tablet.  It's not Samsung's fault, but Amazon's.  Funny because I can watch them on my Samsung phone... but apparently they are incompatible with this tablet.  Makes no sense to me.  All I can think is that Amazon is purposely doing it so that you have to buy a Fire Kindle.  :(",

Movies play very well on it. I like being able to  add an SD card  which  really  expands the storage. No need to keep pictures and music in the cloud. I have small hands so it's  a little awkward to hold but I knew that going in. I bought a matte screen protector which takes away from the clarity of the screen  but it's  resistant to fingerprints  and smudges which  drive me crazy. :)\n\nThe battery life is pretty good ..maybe 4-5 hours which  is ok.

All of the Verizon stores didn't know anything about it, nor when a cellular version of the Tab S 8.4\"would be released.  So I sent it back because of these two reasons.  I bought an Ipad Mini which runs the app fine.  That's another story, as the Ipad isn't very intuitive, and that's what it's suppose to be from all the hype you hear. I've been in computer technology for 35yrs, owned one of the first Macs sold in Calif (1984), but these iPads take some training and getting use to.

Once you install an app for email, etc., it performs very well, and rarely has period of network drop or undue interference that impedes the overall function of network communications.\n\nOf course, more memory, higher link speeds, and higher resolution are always better, but this tablet is a great buy for someone at a lower price point. The imagery displays great on a display that is better than one would think. The increased resolution of the tablet goes beyond some desktop video cards on a typical LCD screen and will not disappoint.\n\nThrowing a fat microSD card inside will alleviate most storage bottlenecks when considering multimedia, but bloated size apps and unspecified storage locations may cause some headaches for non-power or not-tech savvy users.\n\nThis would also be a decent unit for a tween or high school student for school tasks and research.

I've added a 64 GB one into mine that holds PLEX movies and all my downloaded Spotify music\n- Finger print reader is also nice, however most company Exchange servers probably won't support it\n- Ultra fast processor makes using the tablet very fast\n\nSoftware Thing I Don't Like\n\n- I'm not a fan of Samsung's Touch Wiz interface, so I replaced it with Nova Launcher which has a better Google feel to it\n- After replacing the launcher, I discovered the Samsung no longer support lock screen widgets, this includes if you are listening to music, you have to unlock the tablet to change the song, no controls on the lock screen\n\nConclusion\n\nThis is a great tablet if you like to take media on the go with you, as you won't find many others with these kind of specs with a micro SD slot. My only complaint is Samsung's interface, which you can replace with a different launcher, but it still limits things like what you can do with the lock screen. Great tablet though!",

                "review_body": "It has been just under a year now that I've owned this product, and it has been crashing increasingly since I purchased it to the point that it hard crashes about every 5 minutes of use...most often while playing games. I am currently looking for warranty information because this device has become unusable which is appalling considering I spend $350 less than a year ago. I've tried everything I can think of to fix it, or at least make it usable, but nothing has worked. I have never been more frustrated with a piece of technology. There are a lot of positive reviews for this product, I was very confident that I would have the same experience...maybe I got a lemon, I don't know. Any time the battery dips below 60% (which is after about 10-30 minutes of use on a full battery depending how you use it) the screen starts to flash, and within 30 seconds the device crashes and restarts - losing any information you had up prior to the crash. This is sometimes delayed while using it when it is actively charging, but even then it crashes relatively often...not to mention sitting on the floor next to a wall outlet is not the ideal way to use the device. If I use this for a 30 minute session, I get about 15 minutes of actual use. The other 15 minutes is waiting for a crash to resolve and the device to restart, which occurs 10 or more times at minimum in a 30 minute period. I am extremely dissatisfied, and hope to get this issue resolved with either Amazon the manufacturer.  I will update with my progress so that others in my situation can get this resolved as well.\n\nUpdate:\nSince my device was under warranty (the original year long manufacturer warranty that came with the purchase), Samsung was able to repair my device free of charge and it seems to be working just fine now. They did not tell me what was wrong, or what they did to fix it so I cannot update you on that end. The only thing they told me was to make sure I was using a Samsung approved charging cable - which I have always only used the cable that came with the device. Unsure what was wrong, but appears to be fixed. If you're having some of the above issues, either do some symptom research online or hopefully you're still under warranty and don't have to pay for a fix. My experience with the online form found on Samsung's website was okay, it took a little while for them to return my inquiry initially but after that the service was adequate. I'll update this to a 3 star review now that I'm not having any issues with it.",

Amazon received my complaints & instantly sent a replacement. Than you Amazon.\n\nI'm so glad that I didn't change my mind about this tab because of the broken screen. I've used it for several days now and I will say I am highly impressed. I highly recommend it and I'm looking forward to a Note version of this tab.\n\nThe screen is very bright. The resolution is \"razor\" sharp and the colors are truly gorgeous. People complain about Samsung TouchWiz overlay, but I think this unit UI is highly function. On my unit, I removed some of the so called bloat software and left some on it. The MS Office program is the best I've seen on any tablet so far.\n\nPerfect for reading ebooks.\n\nThe camera lags by several seconds before taking a shot. This is a minus, but I don't rely on my cameraphone for serious shots.\n\nThe high resolution at times makes characters appear in very tiny less than optimal viewing sizes for apps not designed to take advantage of the high resolution.\n\nITERATION#1:\nI will update this review again, but for now this is my take on this tab.\n\nThe unit I ordered was received with a cracked glass. It will not power up to the home screen.\nThe low voice over instruction hums when you glide your finger over the home and back keys. The screen stays black.\nHowever the screen never comes up. I don't know if this is because of the cracked screen or a manufacturer defect.\nIt will not power up with the power up button.\n\nThis tab is so slim and portable, it's just the right size for me. In fact as soon as I saw the picture on Amazon, I said this is the tab for me. I would have even buy the LTE/GSM version but it was not yet on sale here on Amazon. SO I had to settle for the WiFi version first. Unfortunately, the packaging material is very thin and in my opinion very flimsy. As a result of this any little bump and bending from handling and shipping can get the screen to get cracked easily. I am not saying this is the reason why my own unit got cracked. But with the type of packaging used, I was not surprised to see the crack.\n\nThe packaging is sub-standard and it lends one to ask the question, \"Why should Samsung make an apparently excellent product like this and then package it in a sub standard packaging? These people really need to do something about this quality issue.\"\n\nI have used several Galaxy phones and 2 galaxy tabs without any issues, but the type of packaging I saw with this tab is in my not so humble opinion completely unbecoming. If they continue like this, then I will have to start considering and recommending other androids.",

                "review_body": "I have grown to like this tablet even more after I have had it for a couple of weeks now. At first I wasn't too sure as I bought a tab 4 - 8 for my GF at the same time and it seems almost as good for a much cheaper price. But this one does have a nicer screen when it comes to pictures and movies which is a primary use for me. But because the tab 4 doesn't have as much resolution as the S it is actually easier to read text in such apps like gmail. But I still have good eyesight so again I could deal with this as pretty much a non issue for me. So I was happy until I saw the 10.5 version while shopping last weekend and really liked the larger screen even more. I thought about it and because my primary use is around the house and not traveling, I decided to exchange this model for the 10.5. I think this version will do better as a pc with a keyboard as well.So for me the larger unit is a better fit for my needs. But if I was traveling a lot I would stay with this version as it is much easier to carry around and is a good size if you want it all (traveling and home use).\n\nPros:  Great screen for movies and pictures. The colors are very rich and the included sample movie looks great- almost 3d at times. If this is what you want to use the tablet for you have picked the best screen you can get right now for the job. Samsung got this right and even Apple falls short in this area. It took me a bit to get used to the colorful screen but now that I have, it is hard to look a laptop screen and not think it has a problem with flat colors.\n\nLots of features for geeks- file sharing with your samsung tv and also your pc. Screen mirroring with the tv as well. This was important to me but it should be noted the tab 8 can do this as well, all except a physical hdmi connection. This unit has great connectivity, just take your time to figure it out as some of it takes time to get it setup correctly\n\nCon: Only con is the price and I have mixed feelings about this. On one hand , Samsung does make a superior product,so they deserved to be paid for giving us what we want. But then they turn around and make the tab 4 series which are really good tablets at a much cheaper price (at least on Amazon). So if you want the best, the S is what you want. But if really good but not the best is good enough, look at those tablets. This is the first tablet I have owned and the pricy screen is worth it to me because it will be used as a multimedia machine.\n\nBest advice: Don't make the same mistake I did. Decide if you want a tablet primarily for home or traveling so you can get the size right the first time. If you can, find these units in your local stores so can judge for yourself before you buy",

                "review_body": "First, about the tablet itself. I would give it 4-1/2 stars. This tablet replaced an Asus Infinity T700. This tablet was everything the Asus wasn't. There was no lag time, the screen was magnificent  and I wasn't constantly getting my internet interrupted. I have a Galaxy S5 Smart phone and the learning curve was nonexistent since it felt and behaved much like my phone. My biggest complaint was that the battery length seemed to be lacking but it was a small issue compared to how much I liked this tablet overall. But.......\n\n0 stars for Samsung.\nI purchased my Galaxy Tab from Amazon on June 21 and it arrived June 24. On July 20 I used it off and on all day with no problems. I set it down on the table, came back in 15 minutes, woke it up and the screen was completely wonky. Lines and squiggles and half black. The touch had also quit working. I called Samsung and told them the problem, they had me try a hard reset...so I humored them (I'd already done that) nothing doing. They said it was still under warranty and I should send it to them. They gave me a RFR and so I did. Two days after it arrived at the repair center I got a call from Samsung. \"Unfortunately your tablet isn't covered for the damage it received. There is an internal LCD crack and we will not repair it under warranty.\" Me: \"Why?\" Them: \"Because it was not defective, the tablet was damaged. But for $159.00 we can repair it for you\". Me: Well I won't repeat what I said to them, but suffice it to say that their implication that I broke the tablet is BS. I did NOT break this tablet. From the moment I had it I had a screen protector and a case. I'm careful with my electronics. After a few more choice words I told her to send it back to me.\n\n5 stars for Amazon\nMy only other recourse  was to return it to Amazon for refund or replacement. I've never returned anything substantial to Amazon so I wasn't sure how it would go. I chose a refund. In the meantime I'm waiting for Samsung to return my tablet. Looking at replacing the defective tablet I realized that I really liked this tablet but now the exact same tablet is $100.00 more on Amazon now than it was when I bought it at $297.00. So I cancelled my return thinking I could re-return it and select replacement instead of return. WRONG. Since I cancelled on 7/28/15 it is past the 30 day return period which was 7/24 and it wouldn't let me change it. So my return was cancelled and I had no other recourse. CRAP! Now what will I do, I'm not about to just give up on $300.00 worth of tablet. So I asked Google, found a phone number for Amazon customer support and called them up. I explained the situation, after some back and forth he said that they would normally tell me to return it to the manufacture but \"this time only\" not only would they accept my return but would send me a new tablet free of charge. All I had to do was return the old one. YIPPEE!!!!!\n\nWhile I am very disenchanted with Samsung's customer service...I mean how do you break a perfectly working tablet by setting it on the table and walking away?  It seemed like all they wanted me to do was either get me to spend $159.00 to fix it or go away. I was very disappointed.\n\nAmazon on the other hand went way beyond my expectations and I am very happy with their flexible return policy and their customer service. I've spent quite a bit of money with Amazon through the years and I'm happy to see that my faith in them has been justified. Thanks Amazon.\n\nPS.  I received my replacement tablet shipped 2 day FedEx. It was ordered while I was still on the phone with customer service. Thanks again, Amazon. You are the best!",

                "review_body": "Overall, I like this tablet, but I have a few concerns. I have both android and apple products, and I'm not loyal to either.  I have an ipad 2, and I've been heavily researching tablets for the last month or two because I would like something smaller with a better quality screen. This tab s has a beautiful screen, expandable memory, split screen capabilities to run two apps at once, perfect screen size (portable but not too small like the 7\" tablets I looked at), and nice options to customize (something I miss on my ipad).  The fingerprint scanner works great. The gold bezel on the white model is really tacky. I was planning on getting the simple case from samsung, but now that I see how bad the gold looks in person, I'll be looking for a case that completely covers it. I've also had problems with lag and reloading in the email app. When I click on some emails, it will flash the picture twice, pause to reload, and pop me back to the top of the email when I've already scrolled down. It's extremely irritating and something I don't experience on my ipad or kindle hdx. I called samsung support to see if something might be wrong. The tech support person remotely accessed my tablet, had me remove my email accounts and re-add them, and also checked a few other things. Nothing helped. After doing all of this trouble shooting, she then told me it was my network. It's not. My other tablets are fine. Then she told me it was normal. Which is it-a problem or normal? And how should that happen on such a top of the line tablet? Then she later told me google is working on an update to android that should fix the problem. Story #3 as to what's wrong. I don't have the greatest faith in samsung tech support now. At any rate, I'm hoping it's just something defective with my unit, and I'm getting a replacement. I'll update my review if the replacement is better.\n\nUPDATE 7/14/14\nThe replacement tablet is also having issues with the email app.  On top of the issues described above, it is also adding white lines through some of the e-mails (they don't appear on the ipad). So, I decided to have a Samsung rep from best buy look at it (they do free troubleshooting of minor problems there no matter where you bought your Samsung tablet). Shrinking the font size to the second smallest setting got rid of the white lines. They think the blinking/reloading/scrolling issues are with the email app and certain senders. They added the yahoo email app, and it doesn't have the issues when I view the messages there (the yahoo app is very, very fast-faster than the native email app). Long story short, I either have to deal with the issues to have a combined inbox in the email app or use two separate email apps (and the gmail app is very, very slow for me). I've downloaded a couple different email apps from the playstore to try to get a faster and smoother combined email inbox, but so far I haven't found one I love (if you have a suggestion, please tell me!). Personally, I didn't like the over saturated look of the adaptive display (makes skin tones, among other things, look very unnatural). So, I changed the display setting to basic, and I prefer that. I purchased an ipad mini with retina 32 gb for a bit cheaper than this tablet, but comparing them side by side, I think I'd rather deal with the issues of the Samsung tablet for the sake of the screen. The ipad looks really washed out next to the s tab. I also prefer the customization options with android. As a final note, in case it helps any of you who also have carpal tunnel, the email apps I've used on the s tab are easier on my arm (my carpal tunnel radiates to my elbow) because you can scroll from the bottom of the screen rather than having to lift your arm every time to touch the buttons at the top of the screen on the ipad. In the end, I'm keeping the s tab and returning the ipad mini.",

But no problems so far with the Samsung one.\n\nGood screen size too.  I love being able to use a SD card to store things if wanted. I'm using a 64 gb one.\n\nUpdate: Dec. 16, 2015....Everything is great about the tablet except the battery life.  I like to play games like Candy Crush and Words with Friends, and they just drag the battery life down quickly.  I have to charge the tablet twice a day if I play my games more than a 1/2 hour or so.\n\nAlso in November I discovered that the tablet wasn't charging correctly and the battery was losing it's charge faster and faster.  Samsung paid for me to return the tablet/charging cord and they were both replaced.  Fast turnaround time.  But I'm just not happy with how long the battery lasts.  I think that if you don't play games much it's fine, but otherwise beware.",

                "review_body": "I spent weeks researching to find the best tablet, and this was the unit I selected. I ended up reselling it a few weeks later. Here's why.\n\nI bought this tablet for its display. It has the among the highest pixel densities of any tablet and possesses the AMOLED display technology, which should deliver the highest contrast of any display on the market. The display certainly does have stunning blacks. However, there's something strange about the display. It may be great for videos and gaming, but that is where the pleasure ends. The colors are a little *too* vibrant, and when you turn off the enhanced color feature, the display still appears somewhat glaring and the colors seem too blue or green or something.\n\nThe display has a reading mode, but it didn't make the display more pleasant to read. I primarily wanted this unit as an e-reader. If you are looking for an e-reader, stay far, far away from this device. While the stated viewing angle for the Galaxy Tab S is supposed to be amazing, it's not. Even the slightest tilt of the display will turn it slightly blue or slightly green. It's so sensitive to this that as you look directly at the display, the far top will be slightly hued one way, and the far bottom will be hued the other way. This is part of the reason reading this tablet is highly uncomfortable, as the colors shift as your eyes move to the bottom of a page. Further, the text area seems to have a strange haze around it that makes it difficult to concentrate on the text. Even the general text area appears to have some bizarre hazy beige box surrounding it. There is simply something harsh and offputting about this display that makes reading it an absolute displeasure.\n\nFurther, the touch-buttons at the bottom of the frame make the device nearly impossible to hold without accidentally bumping them with a finger or even with the palm of your hand as your skin folds over the edge. To use the device, you have to hold it very gingerly as if it were incredibly delicate. The slightest slip and you've exited your app or brought up the multitasking window or gone \"back\" in your app. Long-term holding of the device is tiresome.\n\nYou may think I'm overly sensitive, which I probably am, but I handed an iPad Mini (1st gen) and the Galaxy Tab S 8.4 to several friends and family members with the same pages of text. Everyone agreed that the iPad was a world better to read than the Galaxy Tab, even with its far inferior 1024x768 resolution and LCD panel.\n\nLastly, this thing has terrible battery management. I had the iPad Mini and this Galaxy Tab sitting on my nightstand. I used the iPad for reading and the Galaxy Tab sat unused. I had to recharge the Galaxy Tab twice in the span of time it took the iPad to reach 50%. Even with basic web activities, the battery drops at an alarming rate.\n\nAlso, watch out for plastic case cracks. Mine was developing cracks near the headphone jack. The frame also creaks subtly while you hold it and adjust your grip.\n\nIf you buy one, please keep the following things in mind:\n* You cannot resell it on Amazon without a verified account, authorized by Samsung themselves to sell it.\n* Demand for these devices is low on Craigslist. After a month of posting below market average, I had only one reply.\n* Returning to the seller involves restocking fees and return shipment fees.\n* You're probably going to lose 20-25% of your purchase price if you don't like the device, as I did when I finally sold it.\n\nOn the positive side, the device is LIGHTNING fast. I've never used a tablet this fast. It has reasonably good sound with stereo speakers, and is capable of running Android 6. Video is very vivid and crisp. It is VERY lightweight and I like the aspect ratio of the screen.",

As I was bracing for how big that crack would be given that there was a case that went with it . Anyway resolution horrible too bright and  even at a different mode it was to bright. also very slow charging it took forever to charge this thing. My old tablet does a faster job and it is three years old. Also the sound is terrible and it lags like crazy.  Freezing is also a problem with this model. Everything is wrong with it.

I just did not have faith in many Android tablets and was going to spring for the cheaper Galaxy Tab 4 as I really wanted something to work as an e-reader (books and comics), and movies on the go. However, I had experience with Samsung Galaxy phones (S1 and S3) and was familiar with their eventual lag and generally slow response. I also really never enjoyed the TouchWiz interface.\n\nI\u2019m glad I was able to play with one and hear a review from someone I knew, because this tablet was a fantastic purchase. Bravo ,Samsung. I left your phones, but your tabs are king of the hill right now. The screen on this thing is beautiful, it feels deliberately luxurious and pleasant to hold, and TouchWiz? Revamped, improved and downright delightful. It has some bloatware that I could do without and their welcome console that you can find when you swipe left on the home screen but nothing that really takes you out of it. For my comics, this screen is absolutely outstanding. I was going to go for the 10 inch but this is honestly more than enough; holding it, whether I\u2019m on the train or at home is comfortable, and with the right case you can prop it up and load up Netflix or any other streaming / video app in your house. Saved us a purchase for a TV in the kitchen/dining area!\n\nHighly recommend it.",

                "review_body": "Deciding which tablet is right for you can be really tough!I searched but Samsung offered a much full tablet experience than any other tablet out there in the market.I chose this tablet mainly because of its functions and features.The tablet includes:a good quality camera with flash,IR blaster(which I use alot),a gorgeous Super AMOLED display,fingerprint scanner,sd card compatibility,and a nice looking overall build.I enjoy watching movies and videos on this tablet,it just makes you love watching it more and more.Its very snappy/fast and gets every single task done with zero lag,this tablet is great for productivity!The battery life is just phenomenal,I get almost a full day with having to charge from morning when I wake up until I go to sleep at night.Additionally,one more thing concerning the battery is the Ultra Power Saving Mode which saves you battery up to 2-3 extra days without charging!One amazing extra feature is the fingerprint scanner which adds extra security to your tablet and even bank accounts.The tablet is crazily thin and slim,and the dazzling white version of this tablet with the gold rim just makes this tablet look luxurious.One discomfort would be the placement of the soft touch buttons which I press almost everyday by accident.Samsung really does create the best tablet experience and I wished they could of made the Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 with the same useful features as its predecessor offered.I highly recommend it.\nPros:*Fast processor\n*Fingerprint scanner\n*Super AMOLED display\n*sd card compatible\n*Long-lasting battery\n*IR blaster\n*Nice camera\nCons:*touch button placements",

                "review_body": "The Galaxy Tab S is the best 8\" Android tablet on the market, bar none! 8 inches is the sweet spot for portability and usability when it comes to Android. I'm typically a root and ROM kind of guy when it comes to Samsung devices because I'm not a fan of software bloat nor TouchWiz. Android really doesn't need any \"fixing\" by Samsung nor anyone else, so a vanilla Android experience direct from Google as it was intended is much preferred. Not having a wireless carrier tied to this device really minimizes the software bloat to an acceptable level. Replacing the stock Samsung launcher with Nova really helped to improve the home screen and app drawer.\n\nThere are some Samsung apps that you can't uninstall but you can disable most of them. A free year of premium Evernote and a 2 year 50GB bump to my dropbox account are nice touches. I'm not a huge fan of Samsung's TouchWiz theme largely due to the color scheme and layout but overall the experience is fantastic. At the end of the day it's about the apps, right? Some of the included features are very compelling as well. The multi-window function is my favorite feature allowing 2 apps to run side by side. Smart Detect looks for your eyes and prevents the screen from dimming if you're actively reading. Samsung's S Finder is annoying and useless, Google Now/ Search is a much better option. The finger print reader is an interesting feature but is flawed in my experience. It does work intermittently but sometimes takes numerous swipes to unlock, too many unsuccessful and you have a timeout. Hopefully they'll keep working on this.\n\nThe hardware is best in class, with a quad core CPU and 3GB RAM, more than any other tab in this space. The display is vibrant and visually stunning, really incredible. Opening and switching between apps is effortless with a large battery providing hours of screen on time. I read reviews of some pretty outrageous battery life claims which I have yet to experience. I can, however, use the tablet fairly regularly throughout a given day on a single charge with no issue. SD card expansion further separates this tablet from the Nexus line.\n\nI also highly recommend getting a Samsung Book Cover for this tablet to provide protection, a 3-position stand and added beauty. Not cheap but very much worth the investment. These products are well crafted and feel premium despite repeated rebukes of using too much plastic. It really doesn't feel cheap at all.  Samsung's continued use of a physical home button as well as reversed capacitive \"back\" and \"open apps\" buttons is disappointing and goes against the core Android design aesthetic. All other Android devices have abandoned physical buttons in favor of Google's 3 on screen buttons which is simple and works well. I bet Samsung changes this in future products unless the purpose is really only a desperate cling to maintain parity to the Apple model.\n\nPros:\n-Best in class hardware, screen, battery\n-Android!!!\n-Premium construction and materials\n-Free extras like Evernote premium and 50GB dropbox\n-Light, thin, portable...8\" is perfect\n\nCons:\n-Samsung TouchWiz\n-Some software bloat\n-Some features need to be made better like finger print reader\n-Will be slower to adopt newer Android versions such as Lollipop/ 5.0",

                "review_body": "I have used a whole PILE of tablets. Huawei, Apple, Amazon, others by Samsung (including later models like the S2).\n\nThis is still the single best tablet yet made. It is ultra-thin, ultra-light, reasonably fast, eminently hand-holdable, perfect for reading e-books, with a bright, saturated screen, the right aspect ratio to show movies large (almost as large as on a full-size iPad) but without wasting space with horizontal or vertical letterboxing.\n\nI prefer it to my 2018 iPad and my iPad Mini 3 by a large margin.\n\nIt's a crime that nobody else makes an 8.4\" tablet with this screen ratio, and a crime that Samsung left this format with the S2 and later models and went with the strange 4:3 aspect ratio that iPads use (and that doesn't match any modern media format, meaning tons of wasted space).\n\nThat said, there are drawbacks:\n\n- Battery life is abysmal for a modern tablet\n- It's a bit more flexible than a person might like\u2014thin can equal creaky at times\n- It's getting older and a bit slower\n\nBut... For the price\u2014there's still not a tablet I'd rather have. And I'll be sad when these are all just plain too old to be useful any longer, as nobody else to my knowledge is making an 8.4\" tablet, nor a tablet this thin and light, nor a tablet with a screen this awesome.",

I am a huge fan of Samsung tablets.  I have the Galaxy 2, 3, tab pro and 4.  I must preface this review by saying that I'm an older, retired women.  I am not very tech savvy, but I have learned to use tablets by trial and error.  The Samsung tablets just keep getting better and better in my opinion.  The AMOLED screen is amazing!!  It is so clear and bright, the colors are very bright and vivid.  Reading text is wonderful.  The tablet itself is as light as a feather, I can hold it for long periods of time without any fatigue or cramping of my hand or arm.  It is very fast and smooth.  Set up took less than five minutes.  WiFi connected immediately and all my info synced in a matter of seconds.  I use it for email, Web surfing, games and watching movies and TV shows and it is fantastic.  The keyboard is very nice, very responsive and easy to use.  I can't say enough good things about it.  The battery is also very good.  I went through the apps and either Uninstalled or turned off the ones that I won't use and I turned on the battery saver.  There is also a battery super saver, but it turns the screen to black and white and I wasn't crazy about it so I'm using the regular saver.  I have been using the tablet for 2 days of heavy use and the battery is at 38%!  This is my new best friend....it is perfect!  With Prime it arrived in 2 days.  I would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for either a new tablet or a replacement!!",

Within 6 months the blue screen of death occurred the laptop would not start up. When I bought the laptop Lenovo\u2019s PREMIER service support came with the machine. I contacted Lenovo\u2019s PREMIER service support.\n  The PREMIER service support agent told me I needed to pack up the laptop and send it to them for repairs. I asked for my money back since this happened so early in the life span of the laptop, I was denied. I asked for a new laptop, again I was denied. I was told there was nothing their PREMIER service could do and to send the laptop back to Lenovo. Anything but PREMIER service.\n  I am a disabled Vet on a fixed income with my spouse who is also disabled. We use the laptop daily for medical appointments, ordering medicine, bills, ect. We lost all that information.\n  I contacted Lenovo PREMIER service once again. This time I got someone on the phone who decided to help me make a restore usb image. I did this on a dell backup laptop that is 10 years old and still works, that laptop replaced a dell laptop that was out of warranty but dell replaced it. It took two days to get this laptop running. But a least I got someone who was willing to help. I guess willing is PREMIER service.\n  I spent over 1,200 on a machine that crashed within 6mo. I again requested my money back or a new machine, both denied. I was denied help, until I persisted. I then asked PREMIER service for a warranty extension since I have lost confidence this laptop will last. I was sent an email asking why I needed an extension on my warranty, I explained basically what I have explained here. I was offered a 30-day Warranty extension. 30 days is a slap in the face Lenovo PRIEMIER service.\n  I have bought office chairs, hue lights, tablet all from Lenovo. This is the first time I have has to use Lenovo\u2019s warranty service. I will not purchase anything else from Lenovo because all is fine until you need support. Or in my case lack of it. Do not buy products from Lenovo. There isn\u2019t any support if it goes bad. PREMIER service or lack of any service. Thank you Lenovo PREMIER service for the 30 day warranty extension After all my purchase\u2019s and my $1,200 purchase that crashed within 6mo. STAY AWAY, STAY CLEAR of purchasing anything from LENOVO.",

After buying this one it ran for about 2 months until the motherboard decided to quit on me and I had to get that component completely replaced. Good graphics and nice overall performance until then, but incredibly disappointed in my experience with both machines' motherboards. Noise is ok, but the 5 fans create a constant white noise and I'm struggling to understand the decision to put 3 fans in a position where they are basically pulling from an obstructed area (front glass cover). Likely won't be buying an ibuypower machine again, but it was a good starting experience and lesson as to why everyone was screaming at me to build my own.",

I got it while it was on sale, so I think it was worth the price. It has lasted almost a year with the same performance; it runs demanding games very well and smoothly. There is 16GB of RAM which seems to be the standard nowadays, at least for casual gaming, and it has been enough for me so far. I have run many games on this and performance-wise, it is definitely worth the money. As I've seen with other reviews, it can get a bit noisy but, in my opinion, it's not that big of a deal. My only beef with this machine (which is just an annoyance for me) is the designed hole on the front. What happens is the suction of the graphics card pulls in lint and dust through the big hole and the lint gets stuck on the film type thing on the card. It doesn't affect anything, however because there isn't an easy way to access the front of the GPU without removing a few components inside, it provides a visual annoyance. [Image attached] Again, it's just a slight thing that isn't too bad, just for people like me who find it a little annoying. Solution: don't live in an old house with dust and lint. Haven't had a problem with either keyboard nor mouse, both work as expected.\n\nOverall:\nPerformance for price - 5 stars, runs smoothly and lasts.\nKeyboard/Mouse/RGB - 5 stars, haven't had a problem with either one. Keyboard and PC have customizable light modes. Haven't had a problem with either.\nNoise - Decent, 4 stars, depends on what you're doing with it and how much noise affects you.\nTower Design - 4 stars, looks nice and clean, holds components tight, though inconvenient in regards to potential buildup of lint or dust on GPU film/sheet/cover thing.\n\nGreat PC, I recommend it if you are a casual or somewhat intense gamer. Probably not best for running mostly AAA games where hardware specs are required to be high, though it still runs most well. Would recommend adding extra RAM at some point, although I haven't yet. Enjoy it if you decide to get it!",

I bought the laptop with 16gb of ram and an I7 processor. The laptop doesn't seem to be that fast or efficient at performing multiple tasks which surprised me. My Macbook air is significantly quicker and is the same price point. The biggest downfall to the laptop is the battery life. I think I may get an hour and a half tops before I am at roughly 5%. My laptop is only 6 months old at this point and I am getting rid of it because of how poor it performs. I know the laptop is the cheapest price point for the power however I wouldn't recommend it at all.",

It is not exactly the model shown on Amazon; have to use Asus website app to identify drivers, BIOS, and specs.  *Major complaint is Qualcomm wireless adapter, the wi-fi reception distance is truly poor compared to Intel models.  Windows 10 is not that bad and starts up in 4 seconds.  Hardware is not compatible to downgrade to Win7, even swapping-out hard drives.  Laptop is about 5 pounds and metallic.  The AMD processor is strong, the video quality, and memory expandable to 2x8 GB, which I upgraded to.  I did also remove the 1TB hard drive and installed SSD 2.5\"",

Dealing with Asus customer service is terrible. I had to pay out of my own pocket to mail it back for service to fix the burn-in spot on the screen. When it arrived back to me- it still has the original burn-in spot and now a second one that is new. Customer service tells me I have to send it back again. Never will buy another Asus anything again !\nUPDATE:\nAfter the second time the factory attempted to fixed the burn-in spots on the screen, there is some improvement but they are still visible.\nWe were assured before we sent it for repairs, that the hard-drive would not be wiped.\nIt was returned to us with all of our loaded programs (Office, Photoshop, etc) completely wiped.

It works so well and is so nice I just ordered a 2nd one for my mom.  Also for Ubuntu Linux users,  the most resent v22 LTS loaded perfect.  HDMI works perfect for audio and video with no effort on my part. the wifi nic is only getting 2.4 not 5, but I have not looked into that yet.  YES its an older I7 but it performs very well, and as I said it looks and feels like its brand new.  My battery has a strange issue where it goes from 100% to 50% in 90 minutes then 50% to 0% in maybe a minute.  The seller offered and is sending me another battery, \"THANK YOU\" however I see you can buy a brand new battery for a very reasonable cost here on amazon.

I use it all day at school and the battery life is really good (way better than my laptop that gives me 15 minutes of battery power) Its Wi-Fi connectivity is excellent. The screen size is good and the keyboard is nice and sturdy. Setup is a breeze even a kid can do it It comes with crappy Windows 7 Starter but I upgraded it to Windows 7 Home Premium the same day i got it. I have customized the setting to my taste and it works really good. It is a great addition to your PC arsenal if you need something nice and portable. I am loving my brand new asset",

It interfaces with my WiFi 6e office network very well, the (not touch) screen is clear with good color quality, and it is fast enough for my use.  It does have limited USB ports so if you have a number of accessories to attach, you will need a USB hub.  For me, the one USB port on the right is used for my mouse (I do not use the included trackpad on the Lenovo) and the USB Type C port on the left is used for the RevoPoint scanner.  There is an additional USB Type 2 connector on the left, as well as HDMI and headphone jack, and a MicroSD card slot on the right side.  There is no built-in CD/DVD drive so will need to add that if you use CD/DVD discs.",

The first thing I noticed is the Samsung has FAR better battery life than my existing tablet. The next thing is the operating system is upgradeable, I've already upgraded to version 4.4.2 and it was a snap. Some apps and the way you deal with these apps is a little bit different. Product support is great and when needed they will walk me through a procedure. When I really need help I ask my 7 year old  granddaughter and she gets me going again. I would recommend this refurbished tablet to others.",

You can easily download the manual.  The battery was fully charged which is sort of odd, like someone had just checked it out before shipping.  It has Kit Kat 4.4.2 installed instead of the advertised Jelly Bean 4.2.  Everything else seem to check out like new.\n\nThis Tab 3 is about the same width, 2/3\" longer, thinner, and lighter than my well used old 7\" Tab 2.  It even fits in my old 7\" sleeve, barely.  The additional RAM, memory for apps, speed, and larger display makes it a significant improvement over the 7\".

                "review_body": "**UPDATE:\n6/26/15 Be sure to monitor your tablet within those first 3 months of purchase. The 3 month warranty from Samsung comes in handy. The one I had purchased had a defective battery and charging port the reason it didn't hold a charge. I'd still buy certified refurbished in a heartbeat. Just glad I had the warranty so my tablet got repaired free of charge.\n\nSometimes newer isn't always better. I decided to purchase a Tab 3 8 inch model instead of the newer Tab 4 due to the simple fact that the Tab 3 just had many more features included at a moderate price vs. the newer Tab 4 which Samsung conveniently took some of the features it offered on the Tab 3 standard and put them all on the more expensively priced Tab S 8.4 model. Many features not present on the newer Tab 4 model such as the ambient light sensor, the 5 MP auto-focus camera, the stereo speakers, or backlit menu buttons. I love this little tablet. It's the perfect size! Though I wish Samsung would consider making a 9 inch version.The tab 3 that I purchased was a certified refurbished and at the price I got it for considering it was previously used, I would have never known had the seller not mentioned it. Overall, great value. If you are considering a Samsung Tablet, look at the Tab 3 model first before committing to the purchase. The tab 4 has a faster Quad core processor vs. Tab 3's dual core processor, however, the faster processor does not make up for the fact that the newer model lacked imagination and character. A true upgrade should feel like an upgrade, not a downgrade.",

I do wish Samsung had done a couple things differently: (a) I wish it was slightly wider, so the bezel around the screen was larger, which would allow it to be held more easily without putting your thumb on the screen. (b) I wish the back was textured (not glossy/slick) so it was easier to hold.  That might also have made \"a\" not as much of an issue.  I did just order a case for it, which may make both of these issues go away, and neither is enough to make me wish I didn't get it.  It's a very nice tablet.\n\nBattery life exceeds my expectation, and I've never felt it was slow/lagging in any way.\n\nThe one thing I wish Samsung didn't do, however, is put the menu/home/return buttons outside of the screen.  It does allow more screen space to be used by apps, BUT it's not as intuitive when you use it in landscape mode, and if you flip it upside down, it's quite silly.  But that's Samsung -- they've always done this and continue to do it.\n\nIt also comes with quite a bit of Samsung bloatware installed.  Some you can uninstall, others you can \"hide\" (disable)....and some are okay apps.  Once I customized the screen / apps the way I prefer, they're not an issue, but it's just something I thought I'd mention.\n\nThe camera is okay -- nothing great, but not terrible.  Outside / bright light is better than indoors, but neither is anything to get excited about.  Video recording is limited to 720p.  I use my phone for my main camera anyway, so this doesn't bother me.\n\nThe sound through the speakers is quite good and can be turned up quite loud!  I was impressed.  The speaker placement (bottom, when in portrait mode) means you don't get the stereo effect when in landscape mode, which is kind of dumb, because that's how it would typically be oriented when watching movies on it.\n\nI find it plenty bright, and generally have the brightness set to manual (not auto) and at maybe 20%.  I hate the automatic mode....just like I hate it on their S3 phone.  It has a delay in changing the brightness when it detects a change in ambient light, and it seems like then it just switches between \"too dim\" and \"brighter than necessary\".  Since the level is so easy to manually set (in pull-down tray), that's how I use it.\n\nIf you're planning on occasionally sharing it with your kids, like I do, you can set up multiple users and make the kids a \"restricted\" user where you can limit what apps they have access to.  Just beware that, for example, if you give them access to the video player or gallery to view photos, then they can view ANY video or photo on the device.  You restrict apps, not access to locations.  (Fine for me.)\n\n(My only other comment has to do with Android 4.4, NOT this tablet in particular.  Google, for some ridiculous reason, made 4.4 such that apps cannot write to the external microSD card.  They can read, but not write.  Oddly, they can also create a folder, but then not be able to write into it.  System apps (i.e. the file manager app) that come with the device / are part of Android DO have full access to the external microSD card.  That means, for example, if I use my favorite photo editor, I have to save changes to the internal flash, then use the file manager to copy from the internal flash to the external card if I wanted it there.  Likewise for other things, such as the built in \"gallery\" can read/write pictures anywhere, but my favorite photo/gallery app can read/write to internal flash, but only read from the external microSD card.  DUMB.  But that's Android 4.4's fault, not the tablet's.)",

Very happy with this refurbished product, came with cable and wall charger, looked brand new.  Own it for 3 weeks, no issues so far.  Surprise for me...it has gps so I downloaded an app with free maps (soooo easy) and the darn thing continues talking to me in the car without any wifi!  I checkout lots of ebooks for kindle from public libraries but now with this tab I can now access more books as this supports reading any book from Overdrive.  Bought it for travelling (notused as primary computer) and it works great.  I'm a happy camper so far.",

                "review_body": "I did not get my RCA under counter tablet from Amz, but I did buy this unit never the less. And what a great idea it is indeed. The base station installs under a cabinet via 4 bolts. This base unit has a built-in counter-top light with three brightness levels as an added plus. The RCA tablet fits into a tablet-holder built into the under-cabinet base station and the RCA tablet gets its power from the under-cabinet base station.  Also, the under-cabinet base station has buttons which control the tablet i.e. volume/on-off. The tablet can be removed from the base station and used independently. Any mini-USB charger will fit the RCA tablet for charging when not attached to the base station. Having this CA tablet & base station is also like having an under-cabinet TV or media player, plus access to videos and email. When not in use, the RCA tablet can be swing up into hiding. My only problems were with the android apps that only run in screen portrait mode. When the tablet is attached to the under-cabinet base station, any apps that force portrait mode will be displayed sideways on the tablet screen. Not good. And the RCA tablet comes with Android version 10 and version 10 will lose support come September 2022. So any apps updated beyond version 10 may not run in this table after Sept 2022. This is probably why the tablet and under-counter base staten combo has dropped 50% in price lately. But until apps stop working with this tablet, this is a good under-cabinet combo.",

This tablet only has a 3100 mAh battery (my phone has 4150 mAh) and you'll never get 6 hrs of use from a charge.  A charge/dischage measuring app I use shows at half brightness and no load, the table still burns over 1000 mA.  Just sitting on standby at half brightness, it will last about 3 hrs on a full charge and you'll be lucky to get an hours worth of normal use.  I'm sure it is fine in it's dock on charge all the time, but if you're looking for something you can take with you...forget this one unless you bring a hefty power bank.  In it's defense it is a nice size, although a bit heavy, and does have enough chipset power to stream video flawlessly.",

The device that holds the tablet is mounted an inch below the cabinet - not attractive. The actual tray that swings down is great when it is down but when you fold it up under the cabinet, it hangs down a little. To fix this problem I'm buying some Velcro to hold the tablet in place when not in use. I would think the designer would've had a way to snap the tablet in a secure position.

                "review_body": "This unit was on the front porch when I got up this morning. (around 9 - it IS Saturday) I had it tested, configured, installed (and cleaned up after myself) before noon.\n\nI purchased this device to replace a 10+ year old Phillips under cabinet TV/Radio/CD/DVD/iPod dock. For some reason, the under cabinet all-in-one device concept has fallen into disfavor. My preference would have been similarly featured unit, but, if you can find one, it's very old tech or $1100. Since the current items primary uses were TV and Radio, this unit replaced the old one acceptably.  (see caveats below)\n\nPros:\n1. The unit was easy to install with the provided template, however I had to fold the template back a couple extra inches because at its default fold, the dock bumped the wall before aligning with the holes. (I had to drill twice, so I now have four extra holes in the bottom of my cabinet.)\n2. The screen is clear and bright and large enough to be fit for purpose in the kitchen, (actually almost 2 inches larger than its predecessor).\n3. The sound from the docking unit is clear and the volume can be increased sufficiently to hear above normal kitchen noise. (I wouldn't start the blender, but ....)\n4. The fact that the remote also activates the tablet is a plus.\n5. The three stage LED light is an unexpected bonus.\n\nCons:\n1. The biggest disappointment is the tilt range. The screen drops from horizontal to vertical (i.e. 90 degrees) only. This makes the screen difficult to view from up close, if you are more than 5 feet tall. I alleviated, (not solved) that by installing the device with no spacers in the front and the tall ones in the back. It helped, but did not really solve the problem. (And it looks like it about to fall off the cabinet even though it is soundly attached.)\n2. The tablet is proprietary. The ease with which it connects to the dock is due to the proprietary additions, namely the addition of a four pronged docking port. This may sound like a great idea, but eventually the tablet will wear out and need to be replaced. You will probably NOT be able to get one with the proprietary docking port, and therefore not be able to use the dock. In my humble opinion, the dock should have connected via BlueTooth thereby making it future proof.\n3. The dock has no ports. A handful of USB charging ports would have been great.\n4. The tablet's USB port is micro USB not USB-C. (Although it DOES have a standard USB socket.)\n5. The dock's power supply  is poorly designed. I have a combination 110/USB power outlet where this device is plugged in. The body of the transformer blocks the built in USB ports on the outlet.\n\nCaveats:\n1. As noted this unit was purchased to replace an OTA TV/Radio/etc. combo. This unit has neither a TV nor radio tuner.  Fortunately, it is a basic Android tablet. To address the \"radio issue\", I installed an Android streaming radio app. It took several tries to find a free one that didn't accost you with adds.  I ended up with Audials. It is somewhat cumbersome to find your local stations (have to search by call sign not frequency), but once you find and set them as favorites, they appear on the home screen and you're off to the races.\n2. The TV question is a bit more tricky. I have an Amazon FireTV Recast (PVR). It has four tuners and works with a FireTV Android app to stream both live broadcasts and recorded content. In our case, i simply installed the app and was able to get very smooth and clear, live and recorded content on the tablet. There is, however, an annoying problem with that app. The app ONLY displays in portrait mode, but the tablet is landscape. This means that you have to chose your tv station by viewing the screen sideways. We'll probably get used to it eventually. We generally only watch CBS anyway, so it will almost always be the first square in the screen.\n3. Another approach is to purchase an OTA tuner for Android (about $30). I have one on order. I'll update this review with the results.\n\nOverall, I would have probably been okay with a slightly higher cost on a device with built in tuners, but you have to take what you can get, and this meets (or could be cajoled into meeting) the minimum requirements I established. Since its predecessor was not long for this world I'm keeping this device.\n\nUpdate: TV Tuner trial. - FAILED\nDo not buy the MyGica Tuner. It cannot be installed because the driver is unavailable.",

Also said last updated in 1969 haha but amazon is sending me hopefully the correct version. other than that slight issue it's a nice combo. Love how it swivels left to right depending on where I'm at in the kitchen/dining room. slight downside to it is that i have low top cabinets so the tablet docks to low and it can't be tilted up but it's my new best friend in the kitchen. Watch my shows while cooking/cleaning!!!\nUPDATE 4/30/22: Amazon sent a replacement for the above issue (version on tablet was Android 9 not Android 10 like the product description and cant update) and once again the version is at Android 9 not 10. And version 9 doesn't even support updates or security patches. Google play store doesn't support some apps using version 9, if it was at the 10 version it would support more apps. This is an issue with me personally because 3 apps that are very important to have isn't supported anymore on version 9. But I guess that's what you get for this product to be only 99 bucks. I just don't like that the product description is incorrect and even with getting a replacement to receive the correctly described product the 2nd one was still the same as the first one.",

                "review_body": "I got this cheap on prime day....and all I need it to do is run home assistant. So it technically works for that purpose. There are some major drawbacks though.\n\nThere is NO option in BIOS to set default power state to ON in case of lengthy power outages.\n\nThe wifi chip isn't detected in home assistant (August 2023 build) however the Bluetooth is. The only way to resolve this is to compile your own Linux image which is more than I'm willing to get into to automate my Lights.\n\nThe main board is not removable....the fan is not replaceable...and the WiFi/BT is onboard, not in a M.2 slot.\n\nThe included storage is SATA.  RAM is onboard.\n\nIf you can live with these limitations it's not a terrible unit. But I would definitely look at this as a fairly disposable product due to extremely limited upgrade paths or serviceable parts. It's unfortunate because the bones aren't that bad especially compared to a Raspberry Pi 4 (which is roughly the same price at the moment) and this is much faster. If I could swap the WiFi card and pop a noctua fan in there it would be a much better machine.",

                "review_body": "There's a lot to like about this mini PC. First there's the extremely small size. But don't let that fool you, it's packed with many great features. My 17 year old desktop PC finally died and I needed to replace it. I was looking for two features in a new PC that are becoming almost impossible to find - a VGA port for old-school monitors and an RJ45 ethernet port. The Benss mini PC has both and they work perfectly. Of course, it also has two HDMI ports for newer style monitors so I can upgrade my monitor in the future if I want to. The Benss boots very quickly as you would expect with an SSD drive. It also has two USB 2.0 ports and two USB 3.0 ports for peripherals. I also liked the Windows 10 Pro loaded on the PC. I am not a fan of Windows 11, but it can easily be upgraded to Win 11 by anyone desiring that operating system.\n\nAs other reviewers have stated, the only negative is the fan - it is a bit loud, but I didn't find it a distraction. What was more annoying was the fact that the fan is constantly turning off and on as the workload on the PC changes. But I didn't find this to be a deal-breaker. With a PC this small, internal heat would be very destructive so it is reassuring to hear the fan doing what it needs to do.\n\nI also liked the fact that this PC is just that - a PC without all the peripherals. That lets you choose the monitor, keyboard, and mouse that best suits your needs. Laptops are fine because they are so portable, and I have two, but I also like to custom design my main PC that sits on my desk. The Benss allows me to do that. All things considered, I would definitely recommend this PC, especially considering the very reasonable price.",

I say this simply because just like this unit when you buy them the warranty is already expired. Which means it was activated when the machine was purchased by them and not you. Some people might say that\u2019s no big deal and maybe not unless your one of the people that has one blowup after 30 or 60 days when you can no longer use prime for returns. Yes, you can purchase and extended warranty though the manufacture, but you should not have to. Bottom line if you buy a computer from amazon you might want to buy the offered warranty plan because otherwise you may not have one at all.",

                "review_body": "As is often the case on Amazon, there are many reviews at both 5 and 1 stars that defeat the purpose of the review system; to provide real and honest experiences for other customers to consider as they decide to make a purchase.\n\nI hope this one is helpful and counters the 1 star review citing  'barely run windows 10 if at all/Ripoff'.  That is simply incorrect and uninformed.  Long story short I have a fine device for general computing at less than $200 with better / more  resources on-board than the average under $200 device commonly sold on Amazon.\n\nThe value that a machine like this has for anybody depends on what that person wants to do with it. It is certainly not a ripoff at the sale price of $127 (that was featured for a few weeks in February .)  The complaint about 'no memory' and  'no operating system' (as well 'no storage') is irrelevant as that is by design .. this is a barebones kit and is intended for a customer that can judge for themselves what they need in terms of processing and what they want to add in terms of memory, storage and operating system.  I added 8 GB of memory ($33) and a 240 GB SSD ($37).  A review of under $200 devices on Amazon will reveal that they feature less memory (usually 4GB) , much less storage (many 'too little' 32GB, others 'functioning' 64 GB or a rare, infrequent 128 GB) and all with less powerful processors (some very much less powerful) that would make for very sluggish performance.  x5-Z8350 and N3060 CPUs are frequently featured and are rated much, much lower than the J4105 processor found in this Brix. I did try a x5-Z8350 last year and had to return it.  Evaluations of CPUs are easily viewed at 'fair estimate comparision' userbenchmark.com.  One could get by with 4GB of memory, but 8 GB makes for a generally smoother experience and is not that much more expensive.  240 GB SSD is not much more than 120 and there is flexibility to go with or upgrade to more storage and or go with less expensive hard drives if that suits your needs (like storing and playing lots of local video'.)\n\nIt takes all of 10 minutes to add the memory and storage to this device and anybody could easily do it.  This mini PC works fine with both Windows 10 (free/unactivated) and Ubuntu (free.)  The only caveat that I am aware of with Free Windows 10 Unactivated is a watermark in the lower left of the screen.\n\nI am not a gamer, but if you think that your requirements are high and that high performance is paramount and your main need, then it goes without saying that you understand that this device is probably not for you. On the other hand the claim that it will barely run windows 10 is probably not based on actual experience and does not reflect reality.  I can say from actual use that it runs Windows 10 and Ubuntu just fine.  The past few years I have direct experience with a few carefully selected 'lower end' devices / processors that were used for browsing, streaming, email, spreadsheets, documents and home theater (playing my local video files) and they were all able to run windows and perform the listed tasks just fine .. as did this device.  A quick search on the J4105 processor will bring you to a number of devices that use this CPU and although those devices do have negative reviews for a variety of reasons, none saying 'the cpu cannot run windows'.\n\nI am not an employee of Gigabyte and have never purchased their products. In the past I have purchased Intel NUC kits and Kodlix (under $200 complete systems) and been very satisfied with value and function. In general my impression of Gigabyte is that they are considered a quality brand that will have more positive reviews than negative. I was intrigued by the $127 price ('can that be any good?') as I needed another home theater device so I ordered it (if, in the unlikely case it could not run Windows 10, I would have simply returned it.)  After a week of using this device I am quite satisfied with my purchase and will update this review if I hit any snags.",

                "review_body": "I have had several Dell computers over the years that have held up very well, and the laptops in particular have lasted and performed well above expectations. However, due to reasons, we had to move away from their desktops. So we moved elsewhere for our laptop and tablet needs as well. We have a Hewlett-Packard laptop similar to this one, and I was in the market for another, so I decided to try this Dell and see how it went.\n\nThis is a thin, sturdy computer that will run most daily functions for most users. Whether you're up late at night trolling a message board eating Doritos and drinking Mountain Dew, or up early drinking coffee filling out spreadsheets and doing... whatever it is people do on the stock market, this is the versatile laptop that can do those things. I didn't want to install my second Photoshop seat on it, but I tried a couple of other graphics apps on it, and they ran fine for doing things like adding text and other simple editing functions. I tried Sketchup and it ran well enough, but I really needed an external mouse.\n\nI'm getting another business license for MS Office in the new year, so I haven't tried that. I put another office app on, and that one ran fine. Going online is like butter on my favorite browser. I'm not going to try to play Warhammer 40k on this, but I was able to download Steam and play some games with lower system requirements.\n\nIt's lightweight, and the power cord isn't bulky, so it's easy to pack it and go. I can fit this into some of my purses. I have a couple of older laptops that are meant to be transported someplace and then put down in one spot for a while, and this is not one of them. You can easily pick this up and carry it anywhere you want. I love the backlit keyboard. The light is dim in most areas where I use it, so even during the day, it's a huge help.\n\nIt looks very sleek and professional. You'll feel very comfortable carrying this into an office or school setting. Even someone like me who is always eating at their computer and can't keep greasy fingers off the keyboard and screen shouldn't have a lot of trouble keeping this looking and feeling new.\n\nI love having a headphone jack so that I don't have to rely on battery powered junk that gets lost, I'm pleased to have the USB and HDMI ports, plus an SD card slot, and a security cable slot. I love the SSD 256GB hard drive; if you happen to drop it or it takes a hit, the hard drive won't necessarily fail right away. If you do artsy things with it, or you're just used to having one, the touch screen is a convenient pleasure and can be a bonus when doing those precision artsy things.\n\nI'm not as crazy about the camera and microphone, but it's there if you like to video chat. That's not my thing, so I didn't test it. There's no room here for a DVD drive, but an external one is cheap enough to buy if you need one, and most of the time you won't need it on the go.\n\nThat said, it's Festivus, and I do have some grievances. I should probably add that grew up in a systems analyst's household, which is going to affect my opinions about software and hardware. If it were up to me, I would wipe the drives on every computer we own, install Linux and be done with this madness. Since I can't do that, and since you're probably going to be using this as-is, I'm going to tell you what I think of its flaws as I dealt with them.\n\nInitial set up is a pain, mostly due to Windows, but also due to all the bloatware that I have to remove every single time I get a new computer. It takes a bit of time for some of the bloat products to uninstall, and you should plan on a couple of hours for the Windows set up and any updates. McAffee will tell you the sky is falling if you remove it, and it takes longer than the other apps because they're hoping that you'll give up.\n\nIn addition to agonizing Windows updates, Dell is constantly pestering me to do updates to its own software. I am not sure what some of this software does except badger me to do updates, aside from Smart Byte, which seems to have something to do with playing video. Over the lifetimes of many Dell computers, some of which lasted over 10 years, I never used Dell Support for anything, and all this help and contact stuff just sits on my hard drives taking up space. If any device drivers need updating, I do that myself.\n\nUsually I like to pop something like this open and install more RAM first thing. The problem with this model is that the RAM is soldered in, making an upgrade impossible. 8GB is what you get and that's the way it is. I don't build these things, so I don't completely understand any technical reasons that might be behind why this was done, but I detest being locked into things like this as a customer.\n\nThe speakers are on the bottom, which is not a plus if you want to get full volume out of them. Again, I'm not an engineer and I don't build laptops, so I'm not sure why the speakers couldn't be placed somewhere on top. As someone with ongoing hearing issues, it's frustrating to have all this sound going in the opposite direction of where I need it.\n\nThe touchpad is difficult to control for some reason; much more difficult than my HP. The cursor keeps getting stuck in resize mode on the internet and in other apps, and it's hard to get it back into regular clicky mode. Maybe this is a matter of getting used to it, or personal preference. My husband said he also thinks the touchpad on this one is temperamental compared to the other one.\n\nYou can bend this backwards until it lays flat, but I'm not sure what the point of this is. Why not make it bend all the way back so that it becomes a tablet if you're going to do that? I can't see myself doing a lot of graphic design on this because the screen is so small. Maybe you could do the basics on this and then move to a desktop for the fine detail work. This is more for taking the files on the go and attaching to a larger screen or projector.\n\nThe bottom screws on, so you can't just pop the battery out. You've got to take it apart to do that.\n\nThe power adapter slips out of the power port way too easily when I'm not using it on a desk. It's a tighter fit than my other Dell laptops, but not tight enough, and it's going to get looser over time. This may be something I'm doing as a user, but when I use any Dell laptop on the couch, including this one, the power cord tends to wiggle its way out with my movements. I don't think this is roughness on my part since I don't have this problem on the HP.\n\nIn spite of my grievances, which some users might not find so annoying, I have to rate this laptop four stars. I would have no problem buying this for my mother, sister or any loved one after having used it myself. The reason is that this laptop comes out of the box loaded with everything you need to get going. You'll only need a couple of hours to set it up (even if it is a pain), and it will be easy for most people to do. Computers are not user-friendly, and I think Dell is trying their best to make them easy to use. If you share my grievances, then you probably know how to get rid of most of them, and you'll still have a great computer. I'm happy to have another Dell.",

I'm fine with the day to day items such as surfing the web, social media, email, documents, etc. but I am clueless when it comes to understanding specs, setting up computers, getting things to print, etc. That said, this laptop was very easy to set up and start using - same day as delivery. And as I use it, I'm very happy with the speed, screen and sound quality. My husband - who is Super Techie, was almost impressed with this small but mighty laptop. I even heard a hint of envy in his voice as he said it would be a great travel computer. This Dell Inspiron laptop is replacing my Acer Chromebook which I've had for several years. I liked that computer because it was simple, easy to use and offered no unwanted extras. The Dell laptop is maybe not simple, but streamlined and easy to use. I also like the touch screen. I didn't think I'd use it much, but I'm finding that it's handy to have.",

I was so excited for the quad core i7!  This new processor is so much faster!  From the time you push the button to power it on, until you are logged in is less than 15 seconds!\n\nThe included 8GB of RAM (soldered) will be enough for most people, but if you decide later that you need more, it is expandable up to 16GB.\n\nThis combination with the SSD and the quad core i7 is a really nice setup.  It isn't going to be good for gamers, with the Intel UHD Graphics 620, but they already know that.\n\nThe screen is fantastic!  I was surprised at how great it looks.  It won't be a disappointment.  The speakers are nice as well\n\nThings I feel one should be aware of--there is no Ethernet port, which can be an annoyance.  It doesn\u2019t lay completely flat at 180 degrees, but it is close.\n\nThis is going to be a GREAT laptop for most people.  It is light, compact, thin, well made, and reasonably priced for what you get.  I highly recommend it!",

The first was  a 15\u201d Inspiron 7000 \u2013 purchased in January, 2017. The second was this model (the 13\u201d Inspiron 7000) \u2013 purchased in June, 2018. The first of the two (the 15\u201d) had a problem charging the battery. I was forced to send it in to Dell TWICE! By the time three months had past, I had only used the laptop for a few, non-contiguous weeks. After the 2nd repair, the laptop has worked well. This past June, the family needed another laptop. I fully believed that the previous experience with Dell was a fluke and had no fear in buying another. Unfortunately, it was not a fluke. A couple of weeks into the new purchase, the screen went very dim and started to flicker. I called Dell and was told that I needed to send the computer in for a new screen. The computer was three weeks old!!! So, now, I\u2019m reliving the same experience. I have owned many Dell computers in the past. Nonetheless, I would be very wary of buying the Inspiron 7000 series.

Bottom heats up quite a bit as well.\n-Sound quality is a little grainy through speakers (perfect through headphone jack).\n-Short battery life since new.\n\nTHE GOOD:\nEverything else.\n\nGreat laptop, fast and powerful for the price. Feels sturdy in hand. Screen is glossy and vivid, with good pixel density as well. Haven't had any major problems with it in the past 4 months. There are the minor complaints above, but those aren't getting any worse and they aren't real problems to general use. I've tried a couple other laptops around the same price point before settling on this one, all had major problems in the first month. This one works well, and continues to work well.",

However, when using it in a normal office environment (a few applications and browser open), I got only 3 hours' usage from the charge.

If you're doing very CPU-intensive stuff, expect it to last around 2-3 hours. 4-5 hours if normal.\n- The 256GB SSD is good, but pretty small and doesn't seem like it's possible to upgrade... (I haven't opened it, so can't confirm.)\n- The touchpad is VERY VERY sensitive and a bit off-centered. Countless times I've been typing something and suddenly the cursor jumps to the next line because the very edge of my thumb touched the touchpad. It's something to get used to...\n\nAside from the cons, I've been having a good time with this laptop and would recommend it if you're looking for something in a budget as something you're going to do some programming on.",

I did need to create an MSN account which I thought I had but I guess it's too old! The screen size is pretty good for doing daily tasks. I blog on mine as well and live tweet TV shows and the speed is great. I don't use the touch screen much but when I tested it all seemed to work well and was smooth moving around. Cortina isn't my fave, and she pops up frequently (you can disable this but it takes awhile) and the other bother is that with this windows you don't have an icon for short cuts other than the \"e' file. So, no logo pics are on your startup screen. We did look up ways around this (or at least to get an icon up) but it looks rather tedious. I have no idea why they'd not have this feature. It makes your start screen look all the same. The keyboard is comfortable and it has quite a big mouse area. Lightweight and much easier to transport than my older HP.  I use it off power cord for a few hours (7 so far) and it's been fine. The battery charges up fast.  I do wish they'd have a small lip or grip for opening when shut. It can be awkward. Speakers are good, not the best quality.  It's all back lit which is nice, and gives it a lighter 'look\".",

This PC doesn't fold flat like a tablet, so you can't hold it and draw or write with the Dell pen. The marketing is misleading, as they make it look like it can fold flat.\nDell installs all kinds of software that clogs up the computer. You'll spend half your time trying to figure out why it's so slow or why it's crashing. I had to reinstall the operating system almost a month after I got the laptop. Dell screwed up the installation of a security feature called BitLocker that left me locked out of the computer.\n\nNow after a year or so, the laptop will randomly blue screen and crash in the middle of typing. You get a stupid blue screen with an unhappy face that says \"sorry, your pc had a problem\" and there goes your work.\n\nOne of the biggest issues with this laptop is the power management. When it goes into \"sleep\" mode, like if you walk away from your computer for 10 or 15 minutes, it won't wake up. You have to do a hard reboot, and you lose anything that you were doing. This is a consistent problem that I have every day. Every single day. And since my laptop is now out of warranty, there is nothing I can do about it but deal with the issues until I get another laptop.",

                "review_body": "I love the convenience this petite little laptop offers.  It's quite a bit smaller than my 15\" HP laptop and Chromebooks, though it's not lightweight because of the metal casing.  It has a heft to it, especially for its size.  That said, it still only weighs about 4 pounds and it packs a lot of features into a small little package.  Here are some of our observations:\n\n*  Out of the box, it required a couple of hours worth of updates.\n*  It has Windows 10 on-board and we had no issues adding our Office 365 subscription to it.\n*  It a face recognition option for security, but you can also assign a pass-code or password.\n*  The display is very impressive.  The blacks are very black and colors are very vibrant.\n*  The back-lit keyboard is wonderful for browsing in a dark room .\n*  They keyboard is pleasant to use.\n*  The touch screen is very responsive and accurate.\n*  The screen lays nearly flat, but does not fold all the way around to enable it to be used as a tablet.\n*  It works well with an active stylus for sketching and navigating.\n*  We haven't noticed any issues with WIFI capability.\n*  Streaming is a delight.  The picture, again, is bright and vibrant.  This is where I go when I want to stream something by myself.\n*  I typically have numerous tabs and multiple programs active at any given time and it handles all the traffic very easily.\n*  Uploads and downloading speeds are respectable.\n*  You can use either tethered earphones or Bluetooth enabled gear.\n*  It has two USB 3.0 ports, a USB Type-C port as well as an HDMI port and SD card slot.\n*  It boots up fast thanks to the solid state drive.\n*  It hold a decent charge, but when I'm streaming, I tend to keep it plugged in.\n*  The battery is neither removable nor replaceable.\n*  The charging port is proprietary.\n\nThis little Dell has become my \"go-to\" when I need to look up recipes in the kitchen.  It's also a convenient portable media player and I always have it on-hand when we're watching TV.  It's also perfect for streaming the shows that no one else wants to watch - especially in bed, when my spouse is asleep.",

                "review_body": "Despite the revolution of smartphones and tablets, still there is a need for traditional computing powers for many who work with extensive data and graphics. One of the most important elements of today\u2019s computing is mobility \u2013 where you can just pick up your laptop and go without worrying about weight and size. Therefore laptops like this have become more popular and the companies like Asus, HP, Samsung, and Dell have taken notice.\nThis Inspiron 7000 series (this model is 7370) competes with Asus Zenbook 3 series and HP Spectre series. Choice is a good thing of course. Therefore ultimately it depends on your preference which laptop you should choose. I also own Zenbook 3 (i5, 124 GB, 8GB RAM) and so I can make a decent comparison.\n\nPROS:\n1. SCREEN. The screen is gorgeous. It is bright and because it is FHD (Full High Definition 1920 x 1080) it is a visual treat. I realized that once you go FHD it is very difficult to go back to regular HD, (I also own Dell Latitude E5430 14\u201d 1366 x 768, while it is a very good notebook, the screen is not as good as 7370). Zenbook 3 is also FHD and they both are great for work and watching movies.\n2. THIN & LIGHT. It is really thin (.61inches) and light (3.09 lbs). For a laptop, this is compact and light enough to take it anywhere. Zenbook 3 is also 13.3\u201d screen, yet is bigger than Inspiron 7370 because it has bigger bezel around the screen (and little heavier too, 3.3 lbs). It fits into smaller laptop case with no problems.\n3. STURDY. The notebook made from aluminum, while light, it is strong. Another thing I really like about Dell products is that they have great hinges. They are strong and they do not break easily (as Zenbook 3 series did \u2013 a common issue \u2013 due to design flaw). If you tilt your screen to your liking, it will not wobble \u2013 not the case with Zenbook 3.\n4. PERFORMANCE. Armed with 8th Gen Core i5 and 8GB RAM, most of your programs and apps will run smoothly. I had open MS Office 2010 (Word, Excel), YouTube, Kindle reading app, and several browsers (Edge, Firefox, Opera) at the same time, and the programs ran just fine. However, as you know, this laptop cannot be used as a dedicated gaming console. I have no issues with performance for my daily tasks.\n5. FACE RECOGNITION. It comes with Infrared Face Recognition (part of Windows 10 that utilizes the hardware), and it works fast and well. Although Finger Print sensor would have been nice, but Face recognition is actually cool. I have come to enjoy it.\n6. TYPE-C PORT. This is option is great for connecting your phones, and other mediums (fast transferring data), however please note that this cannot be used as charging your laptop's battery (UPDATE - 1/15/18: It does recharge the battery when the laptop is OFF, but slowly. But when the laptop is ON, it does not recharge, but drains the battery slowly than the normal - depending on the usage. For example, I have noticed that if you watch YouTube, then battery is drained slowly, but when you work on the Word, the battery percentage has been steady).\n\nCONS:\n1. TOUCH PAD. Because of its smaller size, the necessary compromise is that Touch Pad is smaller than the competition (Zenbook 3 is actually quite nice). But if you use a mouse, then this is a moot point.\n2. FAN NOISE. Occasionally, you will hear a fan noise. Not a lot, but you will notice it.\n3. ONLY 2 USB 3.0 PORTS. This is due to inclusion of Type-C Port. So if you use many USB related devices, then you need to get a USB hub.\n4. SPEAKERS ON THE BOTTOM. The speakers are located on the bottom of the laptop, I thought this was unusual. However, the sound is clear and loud enough.\n\nOverall, I like this laptop, I am using it as a desktop, and love the screen and performance. So if you are in a market for a compact laptop with power, great screen, and sturdiness, then consider this one too along with the competition. You will not be disappointed. Recommended!",

So I asked my daughter to boot it up once in a while or use it for browsing the internet. A few days later, the Dell suddenly wouldn't boot up. It did a self-diagnosis and returned all green checkmark results but it keeps getting stuck in the repair mode afterwards. After spending an hour troubleshooting with a tech support, he decided that I send it back to Dell for repair.\n\nAfter a week we got it back. I turned it on and it did the WIndows 10 updates. The next day the problems started again. Again it wouldn't boot up. Their Tech Support again help me troubleshoot but there is really nothing you can do to try to bring a defective unit to life. The laptop is still with Dell as of this review. It's probably the SSD with faulty boot sector that's causing the problem but they should really do extensive testing before they send those units out especially after \"repair\".

Typing is what I do and this keyboard is well laid out, despite being a 13\".\n\nTrackpad is trash, but they all are, so whatever.\n\nSo all that is good for a solid 3 star review for mediocre laptop.\n\nNow I have to bring it down to two because of the failure to resume.  Upon doing some research, it seems to be a known issue, but I haven't been able to discover a fix.  So close the lid?  Maybe it'll resume, maybe it won't, and I'll have to hard boot.  Walk away for a few minutes while it's on battery?  Maybe it'll resume, who knows.  And sometimes it does resume, after one or two minutes.  And I'm talking a legit 60-120 seconds, which is absurd.  I can hard boot it in 20 seconds from start to finish, so having to sit and wait for it to resume is just crazy.  But then it just doesn't resume at all sometimes.  I shouldn't have to open my laptop, hit keys, and then go make a cup of coffee, and hope I come back and it's on.\n\nBatter is wildly unpredictable.  Will go from 30% to 5% in a heartbeat, and it's otherwise meh at best.",

                "review_body": "I don't like this laptop and wouldn't recommend it unless you can deal with:\nwhen it heats up, the fan will make a really annoying noise. I've had laptops that heat up and I would hear the fan cooling the laptop, but it's usually a really subtle, light sound. This fan makes a sound that is unbearable. I've had to stop what I was doing on the laptop ( when I was at a meeting )to turn the laptop off so that it can cool quicker. Even with the noise, the fan still won't cool the laptop effectively and efficiently. It takes really long for it to cool unless you turn off the laptop. The fan is basically useless.\n\nAlso the speakers are at the bottom of the laptop. I need to invest in good speakers if I'm going to watch a lot of videos or tv. The sounds quality is not the best either. At sound level/volume 100, it makes this weird echo noise. It actually hurts my ears sometimes when it's at the highest volume, but I don't really have a choice, because otherwise I would have trouble hearing at any lower volume.\n\nBesides the two main cons above, overall this is a decent laptop. It's relatively light and it can convert to a tablet (rarely use it in tablet mode because this would be a heavy tablet). I was never a touchscreen person, but after this laptop I actually fell in love touchscreen monitors. The computer starts up really fast. The face recognition is efficient too.\n\nAt this price, I would recommend just saving a bit more and get a nicer laptop. It's definitely worth the investment. This was in the upper middle price range, and it's more difficult for me now to get rid of this laptop and get another more expensive laptop. At upper middle price range, you might as well go to the A laptops.",

It takes me about 3 hours of turning the laptop on and off before it reboots. I wish I had done more research before buying this otherwise I would have seen all the complaints in the forums.

My laptop was getting slow and having difficulties maintaining a charge. So, I ordered the Dell Inspiron laptop computer to dedicate solely to my teleworking (i.e., job).  Understand that this review is strictly from this perspective. I wanted something reliable and easy to use. I wanted something that allows me to connect remotely to my work computer and where I can surf. This does the trick. It is:\n\nEasy to setup.\nComes preloaded with various programs.\nCharges quickly.\nA convenient size. Not too big or too small.\nTouch screen. The screen is super clear and bright.\nIt has face recognition which offers extra security.\nHas a long (charging) cord.\nCan install additional programs easily. *I was able to add the programs needed to connect virtually to my work computer.\nIt is lightweight and fits easily in a large purse or laptop bag.\nIt has additional ports (i.e., C-port, USB, headphone, etc.).\nIt comes with a microphone and speakers.\nI know some have complained but my fan is quiet/silent.\n\nIn conclusion, for the price and what I needed it for (I\u2019m NOT a tech person), this laptop is perfect.

I upgraded from a i5 dell with a traditional hard drive that just crawled when doing development on Microsoft's .NET platform. This thing is perfect! The SSD and i7 combo FLY! I have never used a computer that is so fast and smooth with Windows 10. The most annoying parts are just normal Windows issues. A million updates to apply when you first turn it on. Turn it on in the morning and give it all day to do it's thing the first time through. I would have liked the page up and page down buttons in the normal spot, but I get it, they wanted to keep this thing small. Its just a little bigger and thicker than an iPad 2, but its a real, full blown machine. I have tested .NET and MEAN stack development and both are lightning fast. The touch screen is nice too and the facial recognition is not so great honestly, feels gimmicky. This is NOT a good computer to store your entire music collection or a bunch of movies on. The hard drive is plenty large for a developer or for just doing art work or browsing the web. Although speed-wise you could run Cubase or another power DAWs on this, it really isn't ideal due to the hard drive space. For me, though, its perfect!",

                "review_body": "The Transformer Book feels like the evolution of a netbook, yes those 11 inch laptops that were a thing back 5 years ago.  The ASUS Book Flip comes clean with no bloatware.\n\nThe Pros:\n1) Small form factor with 11.6 inch screen\n2) 2 USB ports (2.0 and 3.0), and USB type-C.\n3) Touch screen\n4) 360 degree keyboard, meaning you can turn all the way around\n5) Bluetooth and wifi\n6) 33W power, mean you can use webcams, usb hubs, things that need juice without hurting the laptop's battery\n\nThe Cons:\n1) Display is only 768p\n2) Glossy display, which makes it hard to see in bright settings\n3) 32GB space.  After Windows 10, updates, some files (not software), you're basically almost have no space left.\n4) Fingerprint magnet all over except bottom.\n\nSo so:\n1) The Intel Celeron N3050 has turbo upto 2.16ghz, but not sure if this helps much.  Feels adequate.\n2) 2GB ram may be just enough to do web browsing and youtube.  But any multitasking will feel laggy.\n3) Mouse pad can feel finicky and clumsy.\n\nThe ASUS Transformer Flip is a decent computer for basic usage.  Don't expect it to do anything intensive or graphic.  Its basically for editing documents, watching videos, and doing web browsing.  But for $200 you get what you pay for.",

I like how the computer is very light weight and portable so I can just bring it with me almost anywhere. It is quick and reliable and I have no complaints about its performance. The keyboard is very good as is the touch pad. One thing I do not like about the computer is how loud the fan is. Even when the computer is just on it sounds like a jet plane. It is very distracting at times and makes me nervous. I am not sure if other people have had this problem but it is a major downside to this computer. The other thing I do not like is that the screen resolution is not very good. You can only have two screens open at once and there is often overlap between the two. I would not recommend this computer to anyone who needs to have more than two windows open at once.output: very good computer",

I was a little worried about the space on the system but after installing Windows updates there is still 17.5 GB remaining on the hard drive.  Not enough to install any major programs, but enough to store a few documents.  I got a micro SD card for extra space in case I need it in the future.  My product did not come with Office 365.  The seller (Glorious Days) offered me a $20 refund, but wouldn't supply the code.  I'm not sure if this was just an accident or if the computer no longer comes with Office, but be wary of this if Office is a selling point for you.\n\nMy biggest complaint with this tablet so far is the wifi reception.  There are places that I can get a decent wifi signal on my phone, my old laptop, and even a Nook but not with this tablet.  Be warned that if your planning to use this tablet in an area where other products only get a few bars then you might only get an intermittent signal or none at all.",

The second one I ordered worked.\n\nWindows 10 will eat up a lot of storage if you don't bridle it.  I turned off updates after the initial update at first login.  I eliminated the Office install (and did my own), the extra Metro apps, and used Powershell (administrator -- stop-service wuauserv type commands) to eliminate bulk.

You can install programs to the microSD card (it takes a 128GB no problem), but it is much slower to load.\n\nThe speakers are acceptable, but for me not an issue.

Since it is smaller, it fits easily in my backpack and even in some of my purses and in my tote purse.  I also just traveled and it was great for on the plane.  The battery lasts all day, which is perfect if you are running around a lot and not always near an outlet.  Since it is so small, it does not take up much space on my desks, tables in the library, and is great when you have class in a lecture hall with the super small fold up \"desks\".  It is also easy to hold in my lap.\n\nCons:\nThere are very few.  Sometimes, it can get bogged down because it doesn't have a lot of RAM.  There is not much on board memory, but I use Google Drive for my files, so that is not a big deal.  I also just keep a micro SD inserted for if I need to save anything on there. What really annoyed me at first was since it has such a less popular charging cord, it took me a while to find one that I was confident would work.\n\nOverall, I love this computer.  I use it in all the various modes because it can be easier when I am on the plane, in the car, or in class.  It is perfect if you want something light weight and portable, mostly for internet or streaming videos.",

                "review_body": "Note - I just received my computer today, so I plan to come back and edit this review once I have used it more!\n\nBeautiful packaging and easy to open. The laptop looks sleek and modern, with a solid, quality heft that belies the ultra-thin profile. The charging cable/plug is nice and compact, but a little disappointing to me - the 2\"x2\"x1\" plug with only two prongs will easily slip out of my older outlets at the slightest bump. Not to worry, though - so far the battery life is amazing! Right now it's at 68% after using it on and off a lot of the day, and it still says I have 8+ hours left (assuming if I continue my \"light browsing\" use).\n\nWindows 10 is already installed, and took of precisely 11GB of the 28ish actually available. I will be trying out some additional programs and using it more once I receive the 128GB MicroSD card I ordered to supplement the eMMC drive, but for now, I just deleted a few apps I know I won't use (since this is the Signature Edition there isn't much bloatware) and installed my preferred browser, Google Chrome. One issue I discovered with Chrome is that the touchscreen won't work while the keyboard/touchpad are enabled (aka when you're using it as a normal laptop). Apparently this is happening on most Windows 10 laptops with touchscreens and Chrome. After a quick search for help, I went to Chrome Flags, scrolled down to the Enable Touch Events, and changed it from Automatic to Enable. Works perfectly now.\n\nMy particular Flip came with a free year of Office 365 Personal, which wasn't mentioned in this listing but was in others, so it was nice to see it included.\n\nOther than fixing the problem with Chrome and touchscreen, I've only had one major issue with using the Flip, and that's with the transition from laptop mode to tablet mode. I'm not talking about the physical movement of the hinge - that flows as smooth as butter - but the computer switching to a more tablet-friendly version of Windows when in tablet (or tent or display) mode. If you're only going to use one or the other this entire session, it's okay. But woe to the person who decides to switch from one to the other mid-task! Whatever window you were using in desktop mode disappears in tablet mode - instead you get the hated Windows 8-like app drawer and now have to hunt for your program again (and good luck counting on it taking you back to where you were). Watching a video in full screen and then changing to tablet mode left the video playing, but slightly offset from the rest of the screen (perhaps due to the notification popping up about the switch?). When I left full screen to see if hitting full screen again would recalibrate the size, I was greeted by the menu and no way back to my video, which blithely continued to play in the background. Reopening Chrome did not work, just opened a new window with no way back to my previous window. I went back to desktop - the window was still missing. Finally put the laptop to sleep, woke it up, and the audio of my video resumed playing, still with no window in sight. At last I started the task manager, which somehow triggered the Chrome window with the video to show up in my taskbar again.\n\nWith the ease of switching from laptop to tablet physically, I know I will be doing so mid-task quite often. My solution was to remain in desktop mode even when using the device as a tablet. I will see how this works going forward. I did make sure to leave the virtual keyboard button in the taskbar, so I can summon it when using as a tablet (though I found clicking several times in a text entry field will usually do the same trick).\n\nThe 1366x768 resolution isn't the clearest, but for a screen this small it works well (larger would generate smaller icons and text, and since they're fairly small already, a lot of workaround zoom/enlarge functions would be needed for ease of use). I haven't encountered any lag so far. The touchpad will take some getting used to (scroll is more sensitive, tapping less sensitive than my other laptop). The exterior top is a fingerprint magnet, which does take away some of the beauty of the brushed metal design. The interior isn't as bad, though they definitely show on the touchpad. Keys are small, but nice to type on, with a solid thunk as you press them. As one of my main reasons for selling my tablet and getting this was the ability to do more writing on a more portable device, I think it will work well.\n\nDue to the limited storage, I don't know that this will completely replace my laptop, but I fully expect to use the Flip at least 75% of the time, and could definitely see using it for a month or more on its own if I was between other computers. However I don't use much software beyond Chrome and Office (though I want to use Scrivener and GIMP more, as well as several browser-based applications, and I will test their performance on here), so I don't need a workhorse.\n\nI don't intend to use this for games, which is why I didn't choose an Android tablet. I will use the keyboard to type or as a stand most of the time, so I didn't choose something with a detachable keyboard. I wanted something that would run cool and boot fast, so I didn't chose a laptop with a conventional hard drive. I could have used something with more space, but with the way technology advances, I figured I would be replacing whatever I bought in a couple of years anyway - why not see if 32GB works since the price is right while I have another working laptop? I wanted a device for writing, browsing, going seamlessly between the two as I research, creating blog posts, editing spreadsheets, and watching TV shows. I think the Asus Transformer Flip will work perfectly for my needs.",

The keyboard keys and touchpad are automatically disabled, so there's no fear of pressing buttons while holding the device in tablet mode.\n\nAt this price point, the device works great.The processor is a bit lackluster, so multitasking like you might do on a full laptop might slow you down. But light tasks such as single tab web surfing or using an Office product work fantastically. Don't try to compare this laptop/tablet to a Microsoft Surface or an iPad, as it won't hold up. However, for the price point, this is a great supplemental device that I can easily take with me to work or classes without lugging around my 17\" laptop.\n\nPros:\n\nPrice!\nASUS always has great quality built products. Light weight, but not flimsy.\nKeyboard has very satisfying presses, again it doesn't feel flimsy.\nCharge life exceeds my expectations. Light to medium use will last a couple of days before needing to charge.\nSwitches to tablet mode seamlessly.\nSupports micro SD card up to 128 GB.\n\nCons:\n\nThough touch supports multi-gesture, it is overall not as responsive as much more expensive devices.\nScreen and touchpad are fingerprint magnets, even after only a few hours of ownership.\nNot great at multitasking.\nTiny on board storage of only 32 GB, which includes the OS install. Definitely take advantage of the SD card slot.\n\n*Note: This laptop didn't include the Windows 10 Anniversary Update.

                "review_body": "I really wanted to like this laptop/tablet, but the fact that I have put it away speaks volumes.  I thought the battery life was fine and I did not have the issues with the charger that some other reviewers had.  You are not going to do anything intensive with this system.  I used it when I was on the go and needed something larger than my phone for general browsing, sending an email or document processing.  The wi-fi and bluetooth worked well as I never had an issue connecting to any internet source or pairing it with my phone in a hotspot situation.\n\nThe main issue is the hard drive.  The specs state that it is a 32GB drive, but the usable space is less than 10 after the operating system.  Windows 10 is going to drive you crazy with updates, even if you try to turn off the \"Auto\" function.\n There just isn't enough space to install them.  And it makes using the laptop infuriating.  If you try to install any piece of software, you are done.  You cannot install Office or any of its components.  You can try using an online version of Word or Excel, but you don't have any storage capacity.  You can forget pictures and video.  I ended up using a WD Passport as an external drive connected via a short USB cable for local storage and Dropbox for online storage.\n\nThe price is great, but I just recently went shopping for laptops and tablets and found several that are in the $300-500 range that have larger hard drives, more memory and are upgrade-able if you choose to buy a different component.  In the end, I wouldn't buy it again and I hate that I have lost $250.",

                "review_body": "I've owned tons of computers and I was looking for something with a slightly bigger screen that I could use when I travel.  I had previously used an Acer switch 10 that I bought refurbished on Ebay.  This unit shipped with WIndows 8 and after setting up the computer it soon prompted me to update to Windows 10.  I did the update, but soon noticed that it was extremely slow.  I found that after the update it used almost the entire C:\\ drive.  It wasn't until I removed the old win8 files that it had about 10gb of space remaining.\n\nAs a daily user when I travel, this computer is SLOW.  It was supposed to have a better processor than the acer (atom Z3735F vs celeron N3050), but it is definitely much slower in daily tasks.  Opening more than 3-4 windows in Chrome brings it to a standstill.  This computer is going in the trash pile of computers I have around my house.  My older acer is much faster and I will go back to it for another 6 months.",

                "review_body": "UPDATE 2: It's been nearly 9 months. This will most likely be my last review.\nUPDATE: It's been nearly 4 months, so I added an update at the bottom of this review.\n=====\nThere are a number of good reviews on this gem of a device, so I won't recount some of the broadly agreed upon features in detail. I will touch on some tweaks and gems that might make it a little more usable for you.\n\nSummary (remember, this is value/effectiveness compared to price and device class):\n++ Excellent battery life - consistenly pushes 8 hours on one charge\n++ Very good audio\n+ Good display/video (remember that this is based on devices of this class/price)\n+ Good input (keyboard is comfortable size for these ham-hands with pleasant tactile response; touch pad functions well)\n+ Good speed (remember that this is based on devices of this class/price)\n+ Plays Well with Other Devices (Bluetooth and HDMI connection works flawlessly from what I can see; connecting to other systems via internet connection has been spotty for me though it may be my TV but - haven't experimented enough to be sure)\n+ Runs programs pretty well (have only tried a couple of light/older games which were not terribly intensive, and did not do a lot of play-testing other than to verify that they loaded and ran). Most importantly, I was able to import (install) MS Office 2010 which runs flawlessly as long as you have a legit license - hey, it's a great version of Office.\n- Highly proprietary charging adapter: lucky the power time is so long because you probably don't have to move it (which is when we typically lose or damage our chargers)\n\nIn short, everything that you'd like to see in a budget laptop with the added bonus of transforming to a tablet. The \"transforming\" features work rather well with keyboard/touchpad deactivated past 180 degrees (making it an interestingly useful device to use on your lap up against your steering wheel while in a car waiting or resting, a touch tablet with its own stand, or fully folded as a tablet) and option to enter tablet mode (instead of being forced into it, though you can set a default). As pointed out before, it can be awkward when attempting to use as a tablet - most 10+ inch devices can (my personal fave is the 8\" or a little larger than a paper back book).\n\nHere are some things I noticed that may be useful to know, some common to Windows 10, maybe others common just to this tablet:\n\n+ The power level of a Win 10 device with a 2GB RAM processor running sub 2GHz speeds is optimal for browsing, light gaming and the like. If you're a serious gamer who can afford to play all those great games, you're not running it off a tablet in any case. But if you're generating correspondence, checking emails and calendars, making spreadsheets and presentations, and playing Mah-Jong , then this is THE gadget for you.\n+ The actual physical buttons for power and volume were so responsive that I didn't realize I had pressed it when trying to turn it on. It takes very little pressure to use them and the lack of tactile feedback can be disconcerting.\n+ HDMI output works flawlessly - true plug and play. No glitches using the Project feature (duplicate screen, monitor only, computer only, extend for dual screen).\n+ Google Chrome worked with no problems. I note that here because I've purchased a Win 10 tablet that required a bit of effort to make it work.\n- Forget using your External DVD reader to load programs from disk: that's a chore... I'm not sure if it was my external DVD drive or just something in the whole schema of things, but it was way too slow. I got a drive clone program and mount a virtual disk - which worked exceptionally well for me.\n- If you plan on using Google Drive, make sure you have a microSD card (formatted to NTFS file format) of 32+ GB, create an appropriate folder on that drive and carefully go through Drive's set up routine and choose that folder as your Drive files storage. If you try to save your files to a microSD card formatted on anything other than NTFS, Google Drive will politely reject you (without explaining why).\n\n9/30/16 UPDATE\n4 months later and I will soon get another of the same model to replace this thing, but let me explain why:\n+++ Physical Durability: THIS LAP-TAB IS TOUGH!!! I have dropped it more than my cell phone, I've literally tossed it 8 feet across a room (accidentally - it was sitting on a nearby surface during an Italian Table Flip Incident) and it finally took significant damage while I was on a train where it was accidentally knocked over and the screen developed numerous fractures... and STILL works. I did have to figure out how to disable the touch feature as the fracture pressures were causing multiple \"finger presses\" but it's been 4 weeks and this thing still works GREAT! I'm trying to be a little more cautious with it, so I did by a generic 11.6\" screen protector to keep the damage from spreading, and I've had no issues with display or function.\n- Internal Storage Creep and Windows Updates: Though I'm reasonably careful to use my 64GB MicroSD card, even using to install my programs to where possible, I've still accumulated some data on my internal storage, so I'm under 1GB - which is not enough space for me to get this latest Windows Update. Yes, in the past I've cleared out my previous Windows Updates but I'll try it again and hopefully I can avoid clearing out actual programs. NOTE: Here's a very useful link for cleaning up space on Win10 Systems: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17421/windows-free-up-drive-space . Just went there, and may have found one of my problems in my WindowsSxS (Windows Store) folder.\n\n2/12/17 UPDATE\nI continue to use this as my go to on the go Lap-Tab. I'm very content with it. My only desire would be this exact same product in a 4GB RAM version.\n+ The battery life has not significantly declined.\n+ After finally figuring out how to get it working, a Windows 10 update now allows me to save updates directly to the flash drive, though it would like for you to have 14 GB available. Still a win, though.\n+ I've been able to find a replacement power supply here on Amazon.\n+/- Connecting to my TV via internet connection has become consistent. I was mistakenly attempting to use the Project feature when I should have been using the Connect feature. It often rejects my first connection attempt but picks up successfully on my second attempt. It gives off a occasional clicking sound when it should be giving a system notification sound, and there is a slight cursor lag which worsens if your internet connection is poor. Still useful enough for display purposes but may get frustrating if you're writing a paper.\n- The micro HDMI output port has become loose because of my regular use of it and the fact that it is a micro port which means the amount of connection surface area is low, ergo the weight of the cord alone is enough to put pressure on the port and loosen it. It still works well, but I am careful with it.\n\n[...] feel free to ask questions in the comments.",

That's why I chose to buy a refurbished Dell -- even if it's got problems I know how to fix them. However, even after using every troubleshooting effort known using different monitors, cables, Dell docks etc. I still have no video output from the USB C thunderbolt ports nor the dedicated HDMI port. I have tried every driver old and new, updated all possible updates, did all the YouTube and Dell troubleshooting tips, even upgraded to windows 11 pro and downgraded again.  After finally doing a factory reset with no results I give up. Everything else seems to work fine, and the case is minorly beat up.\n\nLaptop with external monitor capability is useless to me. Returned.\n\n***UPDATE*** I'm adding two stars back because the customer service was prompt to handle the issue and process the return.",

I took it to a diagnoses person when I suddenly couldn\u2019t connect to WiFi and he said the driver was gone and further stated the hard drive was trash. He said the laptop isn\u2019t even fixable. I contacted the seller which was a hassle in itself with amazon and will update with what they say.\n\nOriginal review:\nI LOVE this laptop. It was perfect for what I needed it for. Super easy and compact for easy transporting to and from locations. Also the battery lasts DAYS. Everyone\u2019s plugging in during class and I can have this open without needing a power source. It\u2019s great if you need something simple. All I do is use Word, power point and chrome. I opted out of Windows S mode and downloaded Chrome and it works just fine.",

After a long VERY upsetting conversation with HP customer service it seems that this machine is known by them to loose disk space to updates. To fix this they want you to subscribe and pay to recover space or buy more disk space. I am very upset and if I could return this I would. I DO NOT recommend that you buy this computer and that you choose a much more reliable machine that you will not have to pay to use much less find yourself in a position  where you cannot store anymore content including a simple text document.

This fit the bill...until now.  I've been trying for over a week to install the latest Windows 10 update and it keeps failing because it says there's not enough storage and to free up space.  THERE IS NOTHING on this computer other than what came preinstalled by HP and I can't remove any of it.  There is NOTHING in documents, in downloads, in the recycle bin, in pictures,  or music.  I've run the troubleshooter, defragmented, optimized and deleted, uninstalled everything I possibly could and I still don't have enough storage space.  And, every time I check to see what storage I have, I have even less than I did previously.  HP tech support couldn't help me but would be happy to transfer me to software support for a fee.  No thanks...I'll save my money and buy something else.",

I contacted Amazon who connected me with HP; they told me that the computer I owned for two hours \"probably had a corrupted disc or virus\" and then told me it was no longer under warranty and I would have to pay them $49 to have them look at it. I told them I'd rather trash it than pay them to service a brand-new computer.

The \"S\" stands for \"Satanic\" because it's the Windows way of forcing users to buy their crappy software.\n\nAnyhoo, I tried the Linux demo, but it couldn't find the Wifi card, then I figured, so what?  I'll buy a USB Wifi unit for $15.  So I installed Linux on the whole 32gb HD.  Still no sign of the Wifi.\n\nNext step was to update all of the software, which took 1.5 hours.  After updating the software, the Wifi magically came alive and worked perfectly first try.  An invisible network.\n\nIt's not a perfect unit.  There are no pad buttons, so it's kind of squirrelly, but I'll just buy a little portable mouse.\n\nOther than that, it is a noticeably fast little box and it should be great for day trips and road trips and any time I need my laptop and my files and a way to connect to the internet.",

I keep all my music, docs, photos, videos on an external hard drive and connect when needed. This was fine until the recent Windows 10 update. The computer doesn't have enough hard drive space to perform it. I even had a Microsoft Help Desk rep remote into my computer to help me find a way to either clean up disk space or use my external drive to perform the update. Do you know what his solution was? He said that my only option would be to go to the manufacturer and BUY MORE RAM. That's right - HP has created a computer that cannot do the most basic of functions: update it's own software. So I went back to the seller: \"iTech365 (We Record S/N)\" -- who has now engaged me in a never-ending string of emails where they don't listen to the actual problem and keep telling me to troubleshoot things that I've already looked at. Stay away from that seller, you guys. Because if, heaven forbid, you have a problem more than 30 days after purchase, you're screwed.\n\nNote, I bought this computer mid-May.

Geek Squad told me it would cost $80 to fix the chip with them, which is almost half of what I paid for the laptop in the first place. Even before the WiFi chip broke, I had trouble using Zoom. I used to find HP a reliable brand, but frankly this laptop was a disappointment and kind of a waste of money as now it's just a simple word processor unless I'm ready to shell out to fix it. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this model, and I wish I'd gone with something else.",

I contacted the seller and they let me know I had to register the product with the manufacturer, and they would send me an activation code. I registered my product and had a two-hour remote-controlled service on my PC with and HP representative; he then let me know that the subscription is not included in the normal sale of the product.

Can't move potions of Windows and it already come running in compressed format so no more solutions. This machine and others like it were A BIG MISTAKE BY THE THE CREATORS, as they could have easily stuck at least a 128 GB memory chip where the 32 sits and it would be an awesome machine! I'd buy another or two! What a waste. Anyway, if you need a machine fast and don;t have the bucks for something immediately, this will open docs and print and get email and everything else, but I'd consider it a temp machine for being in a jam, and not a long term use machine, as you can't update Windows and sooner than later the thing will be a security threat for you. Best if you don't need to take it out of S-Mode. For those who can't use S-mode, I highly suggest you get one with at least a 128 GB chip and add a couple of 256 to the ports.",

So I am at an utter loss to figure out when this damage occurred\u2014it was a fulfilled by Amazon product through a third party seller. Did HP ship it out like that, did something happen at the fulfillment center. Either way, this shouldn't be my problem. HP disagreed.\n\nAt any rate, I would have liked to hope that HP would stand behind their products better, but apparently I was na\u00efve. I did not damage this laptop.

                "review_body": "I love the size and weight of this Windows Laptop.  Since I only do research and check my email messages, it is convenient and ideal.  Important caveats:  1) If you already have virus protection software (other than McAfee that was offered for an additional fee if purchasing this particular laptop), you will not be able to download your preferred software because it is in 'S' mode (please look up its meaning).  Unless one is computer-savvy, a low-tech person will not be happy if they are not able to find someone to remove 'S' mode.  Downloading any type of software --  is blocked, period.  I have to take it elsewhere to remove 'S' mode in near future.  2) HP website is not user-friendly.  Options for what you need is not readily available.  A 'Community Forum' may be impressive to others but I was not impressed when I could not easily navigate in order to find what I needed.  3) Although I just bought the laptop a few days ago, after putting in info for warranty, laptop warranty had only 4 months left (?!?!).  I tried to chat but after inputting dispute warranty info, I never connected to anyone and it buffered for a couple of minutes.  I'll see how it works out if 'S' mode can easily be removed, to include its performance.  Besides not easily connecting with HP to resolve my needs and having to drive elsewhere to remove 'S' mode, I hope the computer performs well, especially for the reasonable price.",

Sound, GPU, Wifi, battery detection, suspend.\n\nIt's exactly what I needed. A simple, small, light, long battery life laptop to do software development on at a Denny's without lugging around my very heavy Thinkpad and unplugging it from everything.\n\nKeyboard does not have a lot of travel or feedback, but strangely, it's actually a LOT better than most cheap laptops. Touch typists will like this machine, as long as they aren't mechanical keyboard cultists.\n\nI was wary of HP machines in recent years as I had heard they had gotten quite bad, but this has been a surprisingly good experience so far.\n\nNot only is secure boot easily disabled and doesn't require an admin password (looking at you, Acer), but it also provides legacy/CSM BIOS emulation support, in case UEFI isn't your thing.\n\neMMC storage speed is phenominal, even if there's only 32GB of space. I'm using a heavily compressed Btrfs partition for my root filesystem, so I can manage.\n\nThis machine exceeded my expectations. It's not perfect, the build quality, while better than I expected, still leaves a bit to be desired. It seems to attract crumbs and grime like a magnet, which is annoying, and the touchpad is NOT particularly sensitive, which gets annoying quickly. You need more pressure than you should to get its attention so you can move the cursor.\n\nHP, if you're reading this, you've done well. A slight thing that you did in one previous machine that you should do again: allow booting from microSD. That's a very useful feature.",

                "review_body": "Bought this for my parents July 9, 2019. It looked like an affordable solution since all they do is access the internet, play a few card/word games, and use Microsoft Word fairly regularly. That it had Office 365 included made it very appealing for the price. The case is a cheap plastic, but adequate for their needs and they typically take decent care of their technology.\n\nThere were a couple of hiccups with lag when we first got it set up, but those were overcome and it worked fine for a bit with no phone calls requesting support. *sigh of relief*\n\nUNTIL... three months after purchase, my dad complained he was unable to connect to the internet. They had been away caring for family for three months, so I assumed reconnecting to their home network was the problem and chalked it up to user error. I tried to walk him through troubleshooting and we determined he needed to update drivers, but since there isn't an ethernet port and my schedule wouldn't allow me to troubleshoot in person, I sent him to Geek Squad for resolution. They determined the network adapter had failed and that updating drivers was inadequate to fix the problem. I arranged to get the computer from my parents to process the warranty (we live in different cities) because I thought I could do it faster/more efficiently if I had it in front of me. WRONG.\n\nWhen I put in the serial number to verify the warranty, HP's records showed the warranty began June 28, 2018 and expired August 1, 2019. This computer was listed as new. Now, I did dispute the warranty status and received an email from HP indicating they had updated the terms of the warranty, but every attempt to invoke said warranty to get the computer repaired or replaced gets me in a loop of troubleshooting and when I use the automated system to check the warranty status, it still shows it to be expired. I don't know if it would be easier to use warranty if it were listed as active because I don't have that choice. But at the moment, I am waiting for a phone call from HP (which also had to be requested online) to see what happens next. Seemed like a great opportunity to share my experience thus far.\n\nNow I realized this is a budget laptop and the price was \"too good to be true\" -- but that seemed all the more reason to write this review. Whether it be quality control or luck of the draw, my experience with the HP Stream does not make me want to buy another HP product. Ever. The hours I have spent on this to date are gone forever. I hope I save someone else the trouble. You live; you learn.",

                "review_body": "I recently was in the market for a new workbook / laptop, I have owned several high-end Macbooks in the past but was in search of something simply for browsing, streaming and word editing without spending hundreds if not thousands of dollars.\n\nI was reluctant at first to purchase this product because of Windows 10, but once you get the hang of it it really isn't that bad. The laptop comes preloaded with Windows S mode but prior to the previous review all you have to due is enable the full Windows 10 version in the settings which does not cost you a penny more other than using more store. For example with nothing other than Windows 10 full version + google chrome my laptop only has about 8GBs left of free space which in and of itself is not surprising.\n\nThis laptop comes with 2x USB 2.0 inputs, while they're not 3.0 like some of the more expense chromebooks I don't really have the need for this as most of my information / data is stored on the cloud, which this includes 1 year free with up-to 1TB of storage, a great freebie.\n\nThe laptop also comes with Windows Office Home edition for a full year for free which was a great surprise and money saver. It also comes standard with a HDMI output and micro sd which is amazing to help bump up the storage on this little guy. Currently have the micro SD slot filled with a 64BG chip from an old gopro and have just loaded it up with movies, music and TV shows.\n\nMy favorite thing about this laptop other than the cost, has to be the size, weight and battery life. Compared to some of the bigger counterparts offered this is absolutely perfect for close range use like when on a plane, train or back-seat of the car because the screen is just big enough it doesn't hurt your eyes staring at it for too long.\n\nMy least favorite thing so far about this laptop has to be the screen not having a good anti-glare setup on it and while this isn't that bad to deal with it, it does get annoying in heavily lighted areas :(\n\nOtherwise, for the cost of this laptop I would happily purchase another, between the laptop + extended 2yr warranty the total for this product was roughly $210. Best $210 I have ever spent without the hassle of worrying about spending $700-$1500 on a laptop and picking the wrong one or disliking the product over all.\n\nIf this laptop lasts me for the 2 years of my warranty than that is fine by me this is the perfect little travel companion for anyone who is on the road and tired of lugging around big heavy laptops that battery life barely exceed 6 hours when using for streaming more or less data editing.\n\nThis laptop while streaming Netflix/Hulu/Etc, seems to last me about 10-12 hours without dying! I have yet to drain the battery significantly while doing word processing on it.\n\n10/10 would recommend for anyone who needs a little laptop to travel with, or something for home use when you want to sit on the sofa and not have to be plugged in or burn your legs to a crisp!",

                "review_body": "I'm writing this review from this very laptop I've had for all of 2 hours. First and foremost, I already have firefox downloaded and the S mode disabled. Took like 10 minutes. Went to mozilla, tried to download, then a popup asked me if I wanted to disable S mode for free. Select yes, let it do its thing and now I have regular windows 10. Peasy.\n\nThis thing is a miniature version of our HP15. The keyboard is great quality, nearly identical to our HP15 which doesn't have the premium keyboard. But it lacks the 10 digit numerical pad to the right side, which I don't particularly miss. There are number keys 1-0 up top here. I don't do a lot of data entry, and I'm sure as hell not going to be doing any mobile banking in the middle of a Starbucks. U do that stuff at home where no one can see your keystrokes anyway, or hack your computer. I'm really able to use it well as a touch typist, it supplies a light click touchback with predictable force across the different keys. Touch typists know this can be important. Little things like sticky or wonky keys can really mess up your flow. It's pleasantly quiet with a polite click rather than the intrusive clack clack of some keyboards. The mousepad is quite responsive. Not top notch, mind you, but for this little thing, very good and quite usable. It does two finger scrolling more precisely than the more expensive HP15, which is to say, not stellar but ok. You can also left and right click with light touch or with pushing the mouse pad like a button. This feature is quite sensitive and impressively functional for this size and price. Though do what everyone else does and get a good wireless mouse.\n\nIt of course, is much smaller, lighter than the HP15 (which I use as comparison because we happen to own it, and its similarity to this model) and great for on the go. No DVD/CD drive, fewer ports and smaller 11.5\" screen are mostly responsible for that. But perhaps most significantly, so is the lack of a real hard drive. It has solid state memory (sturdier, lighter than \"normal\" hard drives with discs and moving parts inside), which also means it doesn't have very much. 32gb built in. Pretty underwhelming. It does have a micro SD expansion slot, and some of these micro cards pack quite a bit of memory, depending on how much you want to pay, and they can get pricey. I've seen them go up to 400 GB. Keep in mind that some essential programs - like Windows - can only be stored on internal memory and can't use an SD card. It has 2 USB ports and an HDMI port, so you could use an external hard drive or a flash drive for extra memory if you wanted. Comes with 1 yr free Microsoft cloud storage with up to 1 TB. Never used it, haven't signed up for it. No idea how much it costs after 1 yr. Not sure I trust it, either...but anyway, its an option.\n\nIt also comes with 1 year of microsoft office, which is pretty darn sweet cuz that sweet suite is expensive. Haven't used the most recent iteration, so can't comment on that, but if its anything like it was in 2010-2012 should be good stuff.\n\nIt looks like it can run 2-3 apps at the same time, depending on the app of course. I wouldn't use it for anything but \"light\" gaming. It can struggle with its whopping (read: not whopping) 4 GB RAM. Has an intel celeron N4000 processor, so about 1.1ghz. Fast, but quite limited by its unimpressive 4 GB. Which, I wouldn't get any laptop that had less than that, and many of the competitors do have less at very similar prices. If you're looking for a powerhouse, high performance machine, look elsewhere. My intended use is for on the go light browsing, checking emails, voice chatting without lugging a large heavy laptop around. I barely notice the weight in my bag. It seems to fit the bill perfectly so far. I'll try to come back and make comments as I have it for a bit longer.\n5/2/19 Update: Still loving this thing. Corrected some mistakes above like the processor speed. I have been using this thing, surfing, typing, changing settings for the past 1.5 -2 hrs from full battery, and is now at 88%. This battery is really impressing me so far. Half expecting that as I use this more, and the battery becomes more drained, how fast the battery drains changes. You've likely noticed these battery inconsistencies in your devices before. You know that after XX% on the battery, its all downhill from there, discharges quickly after that. We'll see if this does that. Will leave on standby overnight, see where the % is tomorrow. Also have yet to try camera for skype, alexa, etc.\n5/21/19: No battery inconsitency. Speed of drain seems constant and predictable. I have left this thing on standby for over a week with only about 12% drop in power. Very impressive. The HP15 would have been dead after a few days on standby. Also, the more I use the mouse and keyboard, the more impressed I become with them. I said above the mouse in particular is \"not stellar but ok\". I take this back. Like a new phone, it takes a little getting used to, but I now find myself using a wireless mouse less and less and just using the built in mousepad. Sensitive and accurate. I highly recommend this laptop, I've been very impressed with it so far. Just be sure you know what you'll be using it for and its limitations and you shouldn't be disappointed. I would buy it again in a heartbeat.",

The resolution on the screen is horrible, very dim, dull and faded. I spoke to 3 tech supports and no one could officially determine if it was a defect. Everyone said turn up the brightness, this didn't work at all! I was told by NexiPC they would see if it was defective or not, but only would know if I mailed it off...in this case I would be without a computer and would be out a lot of money considering the 20% restocking fee. First and last time I will ever buy an HP product or a computer on Amazon.

In the past few months, the track pad has gotten tighter and tighter to where it will no longer click anywhere on the pad.\n\nThe laptop also runs extremely hot and the keyboard cannot be touched during a gaming episode (I haven't gamed with it in ages because I am afraid it's going to explode). I have primarily used the laptop for school interspersed with relatively low impact games like Kerbal Space Program or Civilization on lower settings. The games run very poorly, the laptop runs super hot, and the trackpad has died.... all in about a year since purchase. Pretty unacceptable for a $2000 laptop - not to mention that the battery seems like it's swollen and potentially poses a genuine risk to users.\n\nPlease contact me, Razer, so that I can update this review based on what I have heard is great customer service. I'd like to get the problem resolved so I can use the laptop like normal again.",

I bought my 15\" Razor from Amazon warehouse.  The laptop came with an I7 6 core and a 2060 RTX along with 16GB memory.  It was around $1,100.\n\n3rd night I had it I started playing 3 Kingdoms with no issues.  IT WILL GET HOT.  I'll be purchasing a cooling pad before long gaming sessions.  Overall I am happy, hoping it will last.",

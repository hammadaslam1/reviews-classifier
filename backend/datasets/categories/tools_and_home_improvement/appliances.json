The supply lines are included which helped the installation process a lot, the only struggle was to remove the old one.\n\nThe nobs operate very smoothly don\u2019t require any effort to open or close and it is easy to set up the temperature. It looks really nice. I like the height not too tall or short. The water flow feels low at first but I think it is the best volume to conserve water instead of running it at full speed and wasting a lot of water.\n\nThe only issue is that if somehow you drop water on top of the faucet once it dries it is going to show horrible watermarks. It is cleanable and disappears easily when wiped but the look is annoying. Other than that it is a great faucet.",

                "review_body": "Don't you hate it when you have a faucet that leaks, you have fixed it multiple times over the years and it starts dripping again.  Eventually you get to the point that all you want to do is rip out the old faucet and install a new one.  That happened to me with not one, but two faucets recently.  So, when I saw this Peerless faucet in my Vine reviewer queue, I leapt at the chance to try it out.\n\nThe installation was completely textbook.  The top piece fit my sink perfectly.  The spigot and handle piece was easy to install.  I love that the threads on the mounting tubes went high enough to allow things to snug up nicely on my enamel-covered steel sink - it's not as thick as a ceramic sink - I've had problems with this in the past.\n\nIf you have any experience replacing this kind of hardware, the installation should take you around 15-30 minutes (once you have the old hardware removed).\n\nThe instructions are easy to follow...the figures and narrative text are both well done.\n\nOnce in place, I love how they look.\n\nI do have one complaint that to me looks like a design flaw.  Once you have the entire thing installed, the rod (which is angled - I hate this) that you raise to lower the drain, rotates about 45 degrees to the right.  I mean, everything works just fine, but I guess I'm OCD enough that this bugs me enough to cost this product one star.\n\nIt's now been in place and action for a couple of weeks.  No problems except for the one mentioned above.\n\n4 stars",

                "review_body": "Just updating fixtures in the bathroom - most door pulls and knobs are satin or brushed nickel, so went with that for the faucet as well. This was easy to install, but be sure to have plumbing silicone on hand and ready. The old sink had a rubber seal for the drain fitting, so I overlooked that initially when installing this. Otherwise this just dropped in and was an easy install. The slightly higher rise of the faucet is nice, and the faucet handles move very smoothly allowing for great control of water volume.\n\nThe drain stopper doesn't pull down flush and tight, but the rubber seal still holds water. I think it's by design that it doesn't pull down tight so you don't crush the rubber seal.\n\nMy only complaint is the aerator is fully plastic, so I accidentally cross threaded it when I tried to put it back in after flushing the faucet. Removing it and reinstalling it fixed the problem, but I'm mildly concerned with longevity.",

                "review_body": "This was my first time installing a bathroom faucet. I was told by others that it's very easy and takes around 20 minutes. Well, it probably took me closer to 2 hours. But I got it done and only needed a wrench and pliers. I guess having silicone on hand would be ideal to make sure it's all water-tight, but I did not have this and just used what was left from my previous faucet.\n\nMy previous faucet was an ugly (in my opinion) and outdated Peerless set and came with my house 5 years ago... so no telling how old it actually was. It was about time I got something more attractive and more my style. This was perfect in looks for what I wanted in my bathroom. I figured not having done these before that going with another Peerless brand faucet of the same general shape was the safest. It fit nearly perfect where the other had been. The drain is a bit narrower than the previous Peerless drain. And the main base part is shaped a little different, wider in parts and smaller in others, but overall it was close.\n\nI took the whole old thing out, besides the pipes and hoses as this didn't include replacements for those. I followed the directions diligently and often rereading it over because I didn't quite understand. But I do not believe I made any mistakes in the long run. At first the rubbery gasket underneath wasn't tightened enough and leaked when I turned the main back on (as I don't have a shut off under the sink). Fortunately I didn't turn on the water yet as the directions had told me to. And when I did turn it on, I thought to have the drain plugged at the time so it was slow... but potentially that's why it leaked more. However I got that sorted out and tightened it much better. I had a bit of an issue lining up the lever well and in the end find the plug and the stopper lever in back of it to be quite wiggly. On my old faucet the lever rested snuggly on the top... this one is wiggles either direction in the back and doesn't really have a resting place. You also have to lift it higher to get it to seal.\n\nOverall I'm pretty pleased with this. It's nice looking. And I'm happy I didn't have to hire someone to install. I am NOT a handy person... if I could install this just about anyone can!",

I have a pedestal sink and was dreading replacing the faucet since everything I read up to two weeks ago stated I'd have to remove everything. Well, I found instructions that helped me keep the sink in place during replacement and was successful. This faucet is beautiful. My old faucet drain piece was rusting and peeling and definitely wasn't stainless steel under the chrome coating. this one seems to be much much better qualit and I'm hoping it will outlast us in this house. It looks great, the instructions are clear enough (I also had those separate instructions about the sink itself) and it entirely changes the look of my guest bathroom.\n\nYes, it's a simple basic design, but the finish is so nice, that I'm thrilled with it. Highly recommended, no leaks so far!  I've had a peerless sink in my kitchen for years that worked well. That is recently replaced, too, but I was happy with the brand. It is an excellent quality affordable faucet option that is as well-made as the more expensive brands.",

The burner has the exact same configuration and markings as the broken one it replaced except where the model number was etched into the \"y\"\" frame of the original burner there is a gind-off mark on the new one as if the model number was erased. It seems as if this Camco brand is just the Chromalox brand repackaged with the trade marks removed. I was a bit disappointed because Camco's web page explained that their burners had more coil turns than some other brands, and that is what made it \"\"deluxe\"\". When the new burner arrived it had the same number of turns (5) as the original. The picture is not accurate for this item because it clearly depicts 6 turns. Maybe the picture corresponds to the large size 8 inch burners. In any case, the quality is equal to the original and it is functional. I do not perceive anything about it that merits the \"\"deluxe\"\" adjective.\"",

If you use large bottles, you just have to remove the shelf above.  It keeps the wine cool and is quiet.  The only draw back was that it was too tall to put on the counter if you have over counter cabinets.  I put it on a small table in the utility room.  It is a perfect size otherwise.",

Our 8-bottle cooler is 19.5 inches deep (meaning from front to back), 16 inches wide, and 10 inches high. The picture of the 8-bottle cooler is misleading because it doesn't really show how deep the unit is, and because of that, it won't fit many kitchen counters, including ours. We keep it on a small table in a nook that luckily was just the right size, otherwise we'd have no place for it. So measure your counter before you buy. Other than that, it has worked perfectly for us for about 6 weeks now and we really like it. We've been able to adjust temperature (we keep between 53 and 60 depending on contents) and it responds well. It's very quiet, almost completely silent, and no problems getting standard wine bottles to fit. I was concerned when we first turned it on because it did not seem to cool, but it just took a while for it to adjust and set itself.  Since then we've had no problems. Important: Read the simple & brief instruction manual before you turn it on.",

I loved the size and how they could actually fit 8 real bottles, including burgundy style bottles. The size is perfect for my application. I plugged them in and after about 2 hours, they were at 55F. I loaded one with 8 Italian-style bottles (long and skinny) and they fit very well! The other two I took out the bottom rack and put a magnum in sideways WITH 7 other bottles! The temp shot up to 65 on all of them (ambient temp + warm wine bottles), but they slowly fell to 55 over a few hours, which is better for wine. I hope these last a long time, since they are great for my application. I will come back in 6 months and do a follow-up. As of right now, they are working like champs!",

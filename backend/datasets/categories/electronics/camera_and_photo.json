                "review_body": "I bought this Samyang lens for Nikon under the Vivitar brand. Also available as Rokinon, Bower, and others -- buy the one going for the lowest price.\n\nAt F1.4 the lens is sharp in the center, but soft at the corners and edges. Noticeable vignetting that is correctable in post processing. CA is negligible. By F2.8 the lens is sharp corner to corner and vignetting not visible on my D810. Focusing is spot-on without camera fine tuning. Focus ring has long rotation (nearly half a turn) and is well damped so focusing is a joy. There is a small amount of barrel distortion that can be seen if you shoot fences or buildings, but it should be easy to correct. Like other Samyang lenses, there is no lock for the aperture ring. If want to control aperture by the ring, it is difficult to reach and hard to turn, I guess that makes it better if you want it to stay at F22!\n\nCompared with my other Samyang manufactured lenses, this Vivitar branded lens came with a padded nylon bag rather than cloth, and a lens cleaning cloth, as well as a nicer instruction manual that was Nikon specific. I don't know if these improvements apply to any other rebranding or the Samyang original.",

Some of the reviews rave about the sharpness and thought I was making a good choice. Don't mind a manual focus lens and occasionally use an old 50mm super takumar, which is manual focus and aperture. Can't say this lens is bad, but its sharpness is inferior to my old super takumar and I would say no better than the 18-200 zoom I'm using at 35mm. I gain a couple of f stops but I was buying the lens more for supposed sharpness.",

The build quality is insane, and the focussing ring is ultra wide and smooth.  I use this with my 5D Mark II & III.",

It takes great photos, great color, great sharpness, distortion is minimal, it's everything you would want. Built well, works great. The gotcha- I love this one, I really dislike the 85mm. So, I don't know if that is the model differences- or possibly just poor quality control across the line. So deducting a star for that. I dislike like 85 so much, I don't even feel I should re-sell it. But my 35mm copy is fantastic.",

Don't shy away from using manual focusing, it gets easier as you practice more; I find it quite enjoyable actually. It is very sharp from f/4 - f/10, and not too bad for apertures larger than f/4. Build quality is extremely solid and the focus ring is well dampened. Just look at the weight of this thing and you will know what I'm talking about. It feels good in the hand with high quality plastic casing; it does NOT feel cheap, but rather suggest a higher price tag. To wrap things up, this is a great everyday lens when used properly. Understand the limitations of this lens and work around it, you can achieve great photos.",

There's a little lip to help secure the camera so it doesn't easily fall out, but personally I dislike this feature.  I want to be able to quickly pull out the camera to take a quick photo rather than have to fight with it to get the camera out of the case (which happened to me many many times during a recent vacation).  Also, I didn't feel comfortable using the included plastic clip to secure my expensive camera. I broke it off and replaced it with a carabiner.",

                "review_body": "I really like this case. I agree with other reviewers who express concern about its ability to protect camera from a 3 foot drop. But if you want a case that will allow you to shove the G7x inside a bag or pock worry-free, it is perfect. All other cases were too bulky. It's also very compressible and so it's easy to quickly stow, leaving your hands free to shoot. I also like that I can keep the camera strap around my wrist while still having the case on the camera. That way you have the camera at the ready rather than trying to fish it out of a bag or disentangle it from a pocket. Can't comment on strength of belt loop as I don't carry it that way. My only real complaint is that it is VERY easy to deploy the lens accidentally while trying to squeeze the camera in. Unintentionally pushing  the side-mounted wifi button powers the camera \"on\" with the lens closed.  But once powered-up any shutter pressure (inevitable with this snug fitting case) will cause the lens to deploy.  Careful attention to where you press the camera will help, but I still have this problem. I'm thinking of trying the horizontal orientation instead.",

It was slightly snug but once I get used to using it, it was a snap to pull my camera out of it with ease. I loved having the ability to attach it to my belt. It\u2019s more or less why I ordered it. I carry my camera on me a lot...like a lot a lot.\n\nI used it for approximately one week which included some light hiking and a flight across the United States. Still completely pleased with it. However, once I arrived in one of my destinations I took the camera and case off my belt one evening and found that the stitching that held the belt loop nylon on was beginning to tear. :( I didn\u2019t feel confident in it after (didn\u2019t want my camera to come flying off my belt once the stitching completely failed) seeing that and was forced to spend more money on a generic commercial case somewhere which was big, bulky and in my opinion not as cool as this one.\n\nSummary:\nIt was relatively cheap and a good deal at first. Being small, compact and flexible it was the perfect case for what I needed it for. I REALLY REALLY wanted to like this case and use it A LOT but unfortunately the stitching just kind of looked like a weak point in the product. Not really an issue of quality but more of design. If they somehow remedied this issue I would most definetly get another one which I would attach to my belt indefinetly.\n4 out of 5 stars because I just liked it so much. FIX IT PLEASEEEE :)",

But its really stretchy and the camera along with a lens cap fits in perfectly, but tightly.  The belt loop and very secure and properly stitched and that combined with the tight fit means that you will not be able to get to the camera fast if its on your belt, so plan ahead.  Nonetheless, its a great sleek case, albeit with less protection.  And it squeezes down into a tiny size for storage.  The only thing I dont really like is the plastic clip, may have to break it off.\n\nI also got the large amazon basics case for more protection, ie when tossing the camera into a backpack etc.",

                "review_body": "I recently purchased a new Canon PowerShot G7 X to replace an older Canon for use when traveling. On a trip, I take a lot of pictures \u2013 both of scenery and of food \u2013 and I want a camera (and camera case) to be to small enough to wear comfortably (and unobtrusively) around my neck all the time. I was pleased with the size of the G7 X, but found it somewhat difficult to choose a case that I liked for the camera. After spending many hours reading reviews, I decided to order 6 different camera cases to see which suited me best. Note that ALL the cases I ordered claimed to be compatible with the G7 X. Surprisingly, the MegaGear \u201cUltra Lite\u201d Neoprene camera case was the only one of the six cases to suit my needs \u2013 all the other ones were either way too large/bulky OR too small for the camera (I felt like the lens was in danger of being crushed when these cases were closed).\nPROS for the MegaGear \u201cUltra Lite\u201d Neoprene case: 1. the G7 X fit perfectly \u2013 secure, but not constrictively snug; 2. the case itself was actually smaller than any of the other cases that I ordered \u2013 all the other cases were larger (L x W), but some had a shallower or less forgiving depth; 3. the case was easy to open quickly to allow for fast shots of unexpected photo opportunities; 4. the supplied carabiner secured the case easily to my own neck lanyard (I like a longer lanyard length; 5. the case is lightweight and is a stylish and unobtrusive basic black (but, for those more daring than I, it also comes in hot pink, blue, gray and red).\nCONS for the MegaGear \u201cUltra Lite\u201d Neoprene camera case: none really, once you get used to the Velcro closure. I had originally looked for a case with a top zipper opening, but found the MegaGear\u2019s top flap Vecro closure worked well and was really no more \u201cnoisy\u201d than a zipper.\n* I am pleased with my purchase and would recommend this case to other Canon PowerShot G7 X owners.",

There may be sample to sample variations, but mine mounts easily on my GF1 and my M mount lenses mount easily and securely into the adaptor. I think the only reason I didn't give it full 5 starts was the metal that mounts into the GF1 is (I'm guessing here) aluminum, and brass would be better; and the button that acts as the lens release isn't the same stepped design as the CV adapters, which look (and may function) a bit nicer.\n\nI will also have to add the blurb about how much fun I'm having using Leitz (and Voigtlander) glass on the GF1, and how totally spectacular the results are!",

Rather than trying to mount and dismount Leica lenses from the adapter, it seems more sensible to just buy one of these inexpensive Leica to M43 adapters for each lens. Then, you'll not have any mount/dismount difficulty,\n\nAs to infinity focus and looseness, it's easy to get a small screwdriver and some blue Lock-tite, seat the adapter correctly for infinity focus, and then use the Lock-tite to ensure that the small set screws don't come loose. As I mentioned, at these low prices, you can buy an adapter for each lens and easily ensure that it remains tightly at infinity focus.",

However, I decided on 3 because even at half the price (which is where I think it should be priced), I would give it 4 stars.  So 3 it is.\n\nLet me start by saying that it works.  Also, the quality is not as bad as I thought after reading some other reviews.  Until I received it, I was thinking I would not even attach it to the camera.  However, it was better than I expected so I pressed ahead.\n\nIt is an all metal part so that is a start.

First it's not exactly what I see in the picture. I must have received an earlier version because the locking button is different; the red paint that was on it I immediately scratched off because I was afraid it would rub off on it's own and end up inside the camera or the lens. Probably why they changed it to what's in the picture. Good luck getting a newer one. Second, there's no marker to line up the lens with when attaching it. I had to look at the tabs on the lens' mount and the recessions in the adapter to line things up. Lame. Third, the lens fits a little too snug. The way they manufactured it to create grip on the lens is cheap and looks like it could damage a lens if one isn't careful or if the adapter wasn't tested properly. Bottom line, this adapter seems to be of the same build quality as the cheaper adapters on ebay. It looks like I'll be paying $250 for the Panasonic DMW-MA2M adapter. It appears to have the same mount at my M7. My bad for trying out a less expensive solution.",

The M lens to adapter interface is a little stiff, may loosen up with use but so what.  It works and lets me use my M mount lenses on my Olympus e-pl1.  What a joy!  Aperture priority gives you auto exposure.  Full manual control with fill flash exposure compensation is also easy.  I use the 40mm F2 (80mm equivalent in 35mm format)for portraits, indoor low light photograpy.  This lens with iso 3200 on the e-pl1 for theater/church avialable light photograpy is fantastic.  Used my 90mm F4 (180mm 35mm equivalent) with a monopod for a track meet and photographing a bicycle pace line (hand held).  The in body IS stablizes these lenses! Imagine shooting a 180mm hand held on a moving target at 1/250th!  Focusing on the screen works fine.  For precision focusing, one touch on the zoom button brings up the focus magnification screen (7x to 14x, your choise)another push toggles back to compositin view.  In bright light an external viewfinder is avialable.\n\nUpdate 1/28/2011:\n\nHave been using this adapeter for eight months now.  The \"M\" side did loosen up and now is almost as smooth as the u 4/3 side.  The plating on the release button is wearing off and shows some brass but so what, we take it on and off a lot and switch between two M lenses regularly.  At this price buy one for each of your M lenses and get proper rear u 4/3 caps for each adapter.  The supplied ones fall off easily.",

Unlike the other experiences here, the lens fit tightly to the adaptor, and the adaptor tightly to the  Olympus.\n\nI managed to break the pin that unmount the lens, and emailed tech support for help. They emailed me the next day with pictures of how to proceed,  two links, and an offer to have it sent to the factory. Their suggestions worked first time I tried them, so I am one very happy customer.\n\nGood precise mount, great support.",

                "review_body": "In spite of the misgivings expressed by other reviewers, the Leica M mount to MFT lens adapter I purchased worked for me as well as the other Fotodiox Pentax-K mount adapter I have.  The Leica M adapter is much thinner than SLR adapters because back of M mount lenses is closer to the focal plane, and hence it requires a bit more dexterity to install.  Otherwise, the operation is no different than that of SLR mounts and allows me to enjoy my Summilux lens on my Panasonic DMC-GF2 camera.\n\nThere is a deluxe version possibly more refined and easier to operate.  For my intended purposes the product as is works just fine.  For the asking prices of some of the more expensive offerings, I'd consider purchasing a native lens instead.",

What can I say, it metal and it work well with my 50mm summicron. It is what it is, a simple device. Its cheap enough that I may get another one to attach to a voightlander lens. Its easier to use the camera's lens release then the one on the adapter. I haven't used any of the brand name adaptors and I can't do a comparison.",

The 2 compartment insert is substantually smaller than half of the 4 pocket, so the 70-300 fits fine and seems to be well-padded, but the other compartment is more suited for a flash than another lens or two.  As with every Domke product I've owned (quite a few since the Original in 1976), the quality of construction is excellent and it does serve a purpose--just not the way I'd intended.",

In the case of Domke inserts, they are more moldable than the competing inserts and compliment Domke bags perfectly as they keep the bag from becoming too rigid.\n\nWhen first transitioning from excessively padded compartments to Domke, you will be concerned about your gear being properly protected.  Trust me, after extended use and abuse, these inserts will not let you down unless you need to protect your equipment from 20 foot falls onto concrete.  Using these inserts, especially in Domke bags, provides great flexibility and usability without bulk and weight.\n\nMany people are turned off upon receipt citing build quality because the foam appears to come out of the inserts.  The build quality is fine.  They are actually designed this way for flexibility.  They will not come apart (unless they are not genuine Domke).",

The compartment is constructed of high quality material but something was oddly missing.  There is no foam on the bottom of the insert.  Now I've been using some foam inserts from an Ape Case on the bottom of this backpack to prevent damage during an accidental mishandling and I was expecting this insert to be padded on the bottom.\n\nThe insert is not hard sided but soft and flexible and the divider is attached with velcro so if you wanted you could completely remove it.  The sides are padded but a four star rating seems justified for such an oversight of padding on the bottom.  I'm still recommending this insert because its potential uses are endless and it is perfectly constructed.",

Not this one, though. The \"padding\" consists of cheap styrofoam inserts that are not sewn into the bag, i.e., they're removable or, more accurately, fall out easily. The color is more olive drab than the green-hued black in the photo, although that's a secondary consideration. The bag is quite small, although it's capable of holding a Canon T7i, although not an 80D.\n\nFor what it's worth, I've been trying to assemble a \"dream\" camera belt using a tactical belt, and tried the F-stop Navin Pouch, the Hazard 4 SLR bag, and this combined with a large, generic molle pouch. The F-stop Navin Pouch is by far the best.",

I got it as a replacement to use inside my Domke F-4AF bag. That bag came with a similar insert, which is currently being used elsewhere. This new insert is much nicer than the original one. The original insert had a sewn-in divider in the middle. The new one has a movable divider so you can have one big compartment or create custom sized dual compartments.\n\nA reviewer complained that the bottom edge of the sides are not stitched up and the foam protection is not secure. It is designed this way, so that you can remove unnecessary padding and create more room in the bag. So, for example, if this insert is placed next to another insert which already has padding in it, you can remove the foam in one of the inserts and have more space. The foam will be secure if it is used in the appropriate sized Domke bag. Another reviewer complains that there is no padding on the bottom. Again, this insert is designed to fit in Domke bags that already have padding in the bottom. Another layer of foam is unnecessary and wastes space.\n\nIf you are looking for a divider to use in a backpack or some other bag besides the appropriate Domke bag, you should probably look elsewhere. There are plenty of companies, such as F-stop, that make inserts that are much better suited for that purpose.",

The drone barely fits such that when removing the drone the blades catch on the case making damage possible.  Plus the components (remote, batteries, cables) are challenging to fit.  DJI would be better off not even making this case.  I searched Amazon and found plenty of cases to choose from.  I would prefer a soft case but the zippers present a long term reliability problem.  So I explored hard cases.  I picked the Nanuk because its built in Canada (vs Asia) and had proper cutouts.  Now that I got the case I was even more impressed.  The case is well built with great latches.  If you want to spend $80 to $100 then this is the case for you.",

It's a basic handle of the simplest sort: a one inch cotton strap with a wooden stick stitched to the mid section and flat black metal clips sewed to the ends. Almost anybody could make one just as good with 30 minutes of hand stitching and $10 in parts. Of course, why make one when you can buy one for a few bucks more?\n\nI prefer an adjustable strap with softer grip (lose the stick) and handle padding. A leather handle cover would be nice but I suppose that would fly in the face of Domke's spartan design ethics. Length adjustability is the biggie as some of us would prefer more slack or tightness. The design has a lot of extra material folded over, so you could use a button hole knife to cut the stitches and install a simple buckle to add adjustability.\n\nUnfortunately, this handle comes up short in the comfort area. The handle feels fine on an empty or lightly loaded bag. However, that wooden stick really digs into your fingers with a loaded bag. I found an old neoprene suitcase handle and stitched it to the \"Super Handle,\" making it fatter, softer and a wee bit more super.\n\nThe Super Handle is well made, albeit rather spartan, but comes up a bit short in ergonomics. With adjustability and padding this would be a 5-star product.",

Best I could find prior for a small case for my camera was a Think-Tank mirror-less mover 10 I think it's called. Still a bit bulky for such a small camera. In my situation I wanted the \"very smallest PROTECTIVE case possible.\" Nice this Manfrotto case has a little side pouch for a battery, maybe to also fit a duster/blower..small one, or like that. I used Manfrotto's internal measurements and they seem spot on vs my Q which I also measured. My camera now fits like a tight glove..but seems well protected in this case. I'm more likely now to take my camera with me now as this is indeed a very small protective case. For the ppl that complain it's too small...just measure what you want to put in it. No sense in writing anything negative about this very well made case if you choose the wrong size. I'm really happy with this case...seems very well made for a decent price and just so happens to fit my Leica Q nearly perfectly. I also like it's not some no-name case from you know where..aka PRC,..no weird chemical smells...none of that nonsense. Just a very well made camera case for a very fair price vs it's quality!",

This binoculars\u2019 field of view is negligible (poor), which means I can\u2019t find the bird. First, I have to use my regular eyes to find the bird. Then see if I can find the bird in the binoculars. Most of the time, I can\u2019t find the bird. I am looking all over the place, but can\u2019t find a reference point. If one can\u2019t FIND the bird, one can\u2019t WATCH it. For what it is, it is a good binocular \u2014 it is simply not useful to me. I will probably donate it to GoodWill. Maybe someone else will like it.\n\nOn the other hand, magnification is super good, once I find the bird. But so rarely that I actually find the bird.\n\nI will try a Celestron Ultima Porro 8x42 to see if I like that.",

For the price, it slips on and off my J1 smoothly enough, and the lenses similarly mount and dismount nicely from the adapter.\n\nHere are some pointers on the use of this adapter on the J1:\n\nMake sure you have the latest firmware upgrade for the camera.  It is freely available on the Nikon support website.\n\nCarefully attach lens with adapter to camera. Only attach a lens that has a both a focus ring and an aperture ring.\n\nGo into the menu and select exposure; then manual\n\nSet the ISO to 400 or less in the menu\n\nSet a shutter speed on the body with the little flippy switch in the upper right. You can focus with the lens wide open, and then turn the aperture ring to choose an aperture setting. As you close this aperture, objects closer and further from the point that you have chosen will come into focus, and less light will reach the sensor.\n\nTry a shot, and look at it on the screen. You can just experiment with a different aperture or shutter speed depending on your initial result or press the display button until the histogram shows up alongside your shot, and change shutter speed or aperture to taste. repeat.\n\nIt sounds like a lot of work, but once you get the knack it becomes second nature. It is very rewarding to see the stunning results obtainable with old, sharp Minolta glass. It is also nice that this costs a fraction of the amount that Nikon charges for the modern autofocus equivalent lenses on the J1.",

I gave 5 stars based on the fact that it performs as best as it could for an adapter without electronics and for the price.\n\nCarl Zeiss C/Y lens adapters for Nikon mount are usually bad as they do not allow infinity focus if it is a purely mechanical or if it include optical component it degrades the image quality (the whole point of trying to use a Carl Zeiss lens).  The beauty of using an adapter for Nikon 1 mount is that you can have infinity focus without optical components.\n\nThe only primes I have a Nikon 18mm/1.8 and a 50mm/1.8D. The 32mm/1.2 is out of my budget and I was considering getting a 50mm/1.4AFS for better DOF in the 1\" sensor.  But during my trip to Denmark I stumbled on a Contax 139 with a Planar T* 50mm/1.4 (non MM unfortunately) for $18 so I thought it would be worthy to loose AF and give it a try.\n\nThe adapter works as it is supposed to (for a dumb adapter):\n1) You can only take pictures on Manual\n2) Manual focus only. The OK button will NOT enlarge the image\n3) On my preliminary tests the image seems to be good. I like the bokeh.  The colors are great but change dramatically above base ISO (have not had the chance to investigate why). I don't remember seeing that effect with my Nikkor 50/1.8 and FT-1.\n\nDo I recommend buying the adapter? Absolutely IF you already own a Carl Zeiss C/Y mount lens (or can find a real bargain like I did).

I ended up getting my hands on another C mount adapter from EZFoto - and I noticed the overall thickness of the mount is less - tried it on the 50 mm f1.7 and voila, a semi usable focus range [still no infinity] but can focus to at least 3 - 4 meters away [usable for the effective 135 mm equivalent view]\n\nAnyway, I still use this mount for the 25 mm f1.4, but if you use this on a C mount lens and find your focus range limited, you can probably mill out some of the metal or pay about 10 bucks for a thinner mount.",

I suspect the 35mm Kamero my turn out to be a real sleeper as it appears to be extremely sharp.  Mirrorless cameras work much better adapting legacy lenses as they do not require a glass in the adapter.  No loss of resolution at all.  This is a fun way to use all of your old legacy lenses. Will take some movies as I have read it is in movies that the older lenses really work the best.",

What the heck, it was less than six bucks and if it didn't work I could use it for surf casting. If it did, then I could put a few dust collectors to work.\n\nWell, it does exactly what is is supposed to do. The machining is top quality and they even thoughtfully added a tripod mount on the adapter, which is a good thing as the lenses are huge in comparison to the camera.\n\nAdvantages- You can utilize some old glass. There is a magnification factor of 2.7 which makes the 50 into a short telephoto and the 80-200 into a honking 540mm lens. The small sensor in the camera only uses the sweet spot of an already amazing lens. The depth of field is very shallow, especially at f1.4 giving some neat bokeh.\n\nDisadvantages- The camera must be used fully manually. Focusing is a task on the screen, especially in bright light. Setting exposure is by trial and error as you will get nothing to indicate proper exposure. No real issue though, just take a guess and adjust as needed.\n\nSince I got the camera cheap and I already had the lenses, this setup will be my beach camera where I don't like to take the SLR to close to the water. With the big lens on a tripod I can get some good surfer pictures.\n\nOverall, a quality product from Fotodiox. Everything I have bought from them is good.",

Other reviewers have not been very fair since manual should be expected.  Unfortunately Nikon's adapter is just too expensive and not worth the price for the Nikon 1 system.  One of the reasons I really like Canon mirrorless is the ability to get a cheap adapter for Canon EF mount lenses that communicates with the camera and autofocuses.  But that isn't the case with Nikon 1.\n\nThe biggest disappointment for me is discovering Nikon is not allowing magnification when a lens isn't detected.  At least that seems to be the case on the V1 and it sounds like it applies to other Nikon 1 models.  The screen is sharp enough to focus when you don't need to be very precise, but (from only a few minutes of testing) it seems it may be quite difficult to achieve precise focus.\n\nAnyway regarding this adapter specifically it works well as expected.  I bought this one because it allows adjusting aperture and as far as I know I don't think most of the others do (will need aperture ring on lens and most of my Nikon lenses do not have one)",

With glasses off and eye guards on, it works, though it takes some getting used to (you have to press your eyes to the eye guards to see 50X).\n\n20X is perfectly fine with glasses on, as its field of view is significantly wider and deeper.\n\nThis is not surprising (as width and depth of view always decrease with higher magnification), but still worth it to keep in mind. Better 25x eyepieces would have offered better viewing experiences.\n\nAt 20x with help of the included LED light, you can clearly see an enlarged 3D image of a lady bug. Depth of view at 20x is enough for lady bug (or any insect of same of less thickness). 20x or 50x also works well for a small ant.\n\nDiameter of the eyepieces are 23 mm. If you need 10X (and wider and deeper view), you can buy a pair of 23 mm 5X eyepieces to use with this scope.\n\nBuild quality is not bad for the price. I saw exposed circuit boards in the scope's battery compartment and loose/cheap plastic parts. Main body of this scope is light and made of plastic. However optics are decent enough (though, again, 25x eyepieces could use a wider view).",

I bought it three months ago, and have found it to be both a great supplement to my telescope sessions, and also a very useful instrument on it\u2019s own. Here in western Oregon where I live, opportunities for stargazing can be fleeting in fall and winter. Being waterproofed and nitrogen filled means it won\u2019t easily fog up.\n\nWith a magnification of 7x and an aperture of 50mm, the Marine 3 brings in plenty of starlight for scanning the sky. Even in my light polluted suburbs, I\u2019m able to view the Andromeda Galaxy, the Orion Nebula and a few of the other showcase Messier objects. The eye relief is great and the monocular fits well in my hand. It\u2019s light enough to minimize shakiness while viewing, and it provides a nice, wide field of view. Recommended!",

I find myself looking for detail moving the focus up and down to really perfect the focus. Once in focus nothing is sharper! Sharpness (of course not magnification) is as good  as neighbors $3500 15 x 56  and $600 10 x 21 binoculars. In dim lighting everything is much brighter than with naked eyes. QUALITY of this monocular is TOPS! I bought and returned roof prism monoculars with ED glass because this was better such as better than the ED glass Hawk monocular not even close in sharpness (though it is a 8 x 42 it will obviously, also, gather less light).",

                "review_body": "I love the idea of this product, but in practice it's a little cumbersome. I've been using it with the new Pentax K-X for about a month and a half. I normally have the 18-55mm kit lense attached. With this combination it does fit, but it's a tight squeeze and I worry a little about putting too much force on the lens to loop the top over. It has stretched out some and I think it does its job well enough now. I'd probably go for the Op/Tech type neoprene case if I had to do it over again, although that one might have its own problems.",

As others have mentioned, it can be a little tricky placing the camera into the cover but I see that as a sacrifice I make for the compact design of this product..no big deal.  I was concerned that the grip on my camera might prevent the cover from closing properly but was quickly relieved to see that it wasn't an issue at all.  The lens area of the cover provides me a little extra room at the end which is good because if I accidently hit the power button on the camera as I'm placing it in the case the lens has some room to extend.  If the lens had no room to extend it could damage the lens motor, so I'm glad there is a little extra room.\n\nSeems perfect for moderate protection from scrathes and bumps. I like it.",

In the picture it shows an extension clip straps but they are not included? Initially I thought there maybe a second option where the extra extension clip is included but no. I've bought two and both came with just the leather strap. So for that I'm taking 2 stars just for false advertising.",

                "review_body": "I once owned a pair of budget Barska porro prism binos when I was younger. They were adequate and I have to say worked very well. That's mainly what Barska is known for. There were hardly any reviews on these particular binos anywhere so I was rather hesitant.  But I decided to take a chance with the Ed glass and all. At the moment I own Bushnell Legend L 12x50 ED, an old pair of Zen rays 10x42, these Barskas 10x42, and 1 pair of Vanguard Spirt ED, all roof prism. I'm going to compare these to the Legend L. The Bushnells are very good binoculars and like them better than the Vortex Diamondback for clarity and edge to edge viewing, and no color issues. Edge to edge so far have found nothing. And very clear. I',m satisfied with them. When I got the Barskas and tried them I was sort of stunned. I got what I was hoping for. These are even clearer and more detailed than the Legend! An etched clarity. And with the same edge to edge clarity. Not only that it matched them in every other optical way, including light transmission, and keep in mind the Lgends are 12x50. Mechanically I like the Legends a little better, while the legends are  significantly heavier.  The only other thing I would say is at the price they are at this time, they are a steal! They're worth much more in my opinion. And they have a limited lifetime warranty.",

Because it is a direct knockoff of the RoundFlash ring adapter. And when companies do things like this (CowboyStudios is, in fact, pretty famous for having no respect for IP) it stifles innovation.\n\nThe RoundFlash was an innovative approach to ring flash adapters. But why would someone in the future put in the time, work, money and risk to create cool things when you can expect to see it ripped off by companies like CowboyStudio?\n\nThe original version is better made, comes without the baggage of damaging the industry and only a little more expensive. Please don't support these kinds of shady ethics companies.",

Works great on a boom for accent/hair light and when you need soft directional well placed light.",

They are a cheap, plastic hinge system the kind of locks in place, but any amount of pressure ore movements unlocks them.\n\nEven the center where you put the lens is far inferior to the real one and the one pictured on this.\n\nI assure you that this item will be useless to you if purchased.

Fit is snug- a good thing. Easier to mount to the flash before you put the front fabric on so you can reach in. Once on, it performs nicely. Will not be confused for a 24x24 softbox, but easy to handle in one hand while the camera is in the other (using wireless remotes or a TTL cable).",

I should have known better when the velcro pulled right off of the inner diffuser as soon as I tried to attach it to the inner velcro flaps (I didn't pull on it hard or anything). I was ok with this for $12.00 though so I superglued the velcro back on. So then I go to put it on my flash. The hole in the back was to small to fit around my Yongnuo YN560 OR my Nikon SB26 which renders this \"universal fit\" product worthless to me. Also the black material it is made out of is very poor quality, there are small holes in it straight out of the packaging and I don't see it lasting more than a couple months with regular use (if that). I really, really wanted to like this but I can't find any reason to.\n\nAlso, in case Amazon is wondering why I am reviewing something I didn't buy from them, I bought this off of eBay DIRECTLY FROM Cowboy Studios because they had it for $12 with free shipping.",

When I saw this product, which looks like a smaller version of my 24\"X24\" softboxes I knew I had the answer.  Now that it has arrived, I'm not disappointed.  I use the softbox attached to my speedlight on a flash bracket which places the entire assembly high above my camera.  When shooting up close (2-4 ft.)  the softbox creates soft, smooth shadow transitions.  It isn't a large softbox of course, so when you back up a bit, reducing the effective size of the light, the shadows become more defined quickly.  Usually, I use this along with a 24\"X24\" softbox or a 43\" umbrella on a pole and held by a VAL as a main light and my small 9\" softbox on my flash bracket as fill.  This is a great two light event setup and gives me a ton of options and flexibility.\nThe opening in the 9\" softbox fits snuggly on my YN 565 EX flash (virtually the same size as a Canon 580 EX) and the two sets of wide velcro straps won't let go anytime soon.  One thing I discovered right away in regards to mounting my flash inside the unit is to not strap the flash into the softbox firmly.  Doing so causes the flash to point to the bottom of the softbox.  Letting the straps have a little play will keep the flash head pointed forward and still keep the softbox from falling off.\nFour stars?  This thing isn't going to fall apart on me...especially since I'll never fold it back up and put it back into it's case.  But the stitching could be a little better.  Still...for $15?  It's a very useful modifier.",

                "review_body": "I regularly use small, inexpensive soft boxes on speedlites when traveling, usually for off camera flash, as I find they noticeably improve the resulting picture when shooting portraits from up close.\nFor years I have used very simple ones that tend to not hold well together and break easily but are otherwise downright cheap to buy ($10 or less), very light and can fit in any pocket of any bag.\nExcept for travel portrait I also use them for macro photography where stacked-up macro rings eat so much light that you can't really consider going without some additional lighting.\nThe problem with them in addition to their flimsiness is the lack of double buffering resulting in a somewhat uneven lighting pattern, especially visible when shooting macro, and their size really too small for portrait.\n\nThis 9-inch softbox solves these two problems: double buffering produces a very even light field and 9 inches is bigger yet still a manageable size when doing macro or for travel.\n\nThe quality of the fabric seems right; the interior is very reflective and the results match my expectations for the price and design.\nThe lips on the side do a decent job at controlling light spillage and restricting illumination to where you want it.\n\nNow it is not perfect.\nIt folds to a manageable flat form that can be stored away in a pouch, but the folding is pretty stressful on the frame which is made of a springy wire of a gauge more suitable for soft boxes twice or thrice the size, resulting in a required folding effort too high for the size of the softbox. This results in deformations of the size of the frame on the inner fold once folded, and my questioning of how many folding/unfolding it will withstand.\nSo far maybe 20 and it works just fine.\n\nAnother sticking point is the way the speedlite is attached to it. Its head is to be stuck in the hole at the back of the soft-box, which features an elastic ring of fabric for light tightness (works very reasonably) and two pairs of velcro straps to attach at the back of the head. This means that your speedlite must be folded in the classic \"cobra\" position, or the straps would slip; and it also means that the actual angle of the soft box on the flash is somewhat haphazard.\nThis is not necessarily a drama considering you have double-buffering to avoid hot spots on the front buffer, but if you add to that the impetus to rotate the head 90 degrees to a side to expose the sensor used for remote triggering the speedlite (canonistas will know what I mean) it can become somewhat flimsy.\nThen of course it remains a small soft box - this is fine for travel portrait or macro but it remains utterly inadequate for your usual fashion shoot.\n\nAll in all for the price a good acquisition. It will not take good pictures for you but if you know what you are doing it should help you a lot.",

Both bags have performed exceptionally well surviving the use and abuse of 2 teens and a trip to Hawaii.  I'll purchase 1 for myself for use when toting the big bag is impractical or prohibitive.

The inside dividers use velcro straps and can be moved to get the camcorder secure and floating within the compartment.

If you're looking for a light to medium duty case that has a lot of well placed pockets and is fairly light weight, I'd recommend this case. I use it to store a Panasonic HPX-170 camera and it fits fairly snuggly, but that also helps it from moving around in the case. There is also plenty of room/pockets for P2 cards, laptop, hard drives, headphones and other accessories.

I planned for this though and ordered the ACPRO1400 alongside it and so far am pleased with it. I'll drop a review on it after using it for a while.\n\nAlso, if you want quick access to your camera like they advertise then beware of the 270-degree-zip-open-as-well-as-un-clip-all-three-strap-clips \"quickly\" when fully closed. And the top sorta folds awkwardly.\n\nDo not mis-read me. I like this case but only for a smaller body like a D90/grip or a full-frame with no grip and perhaps 2 mid to full-size lenses. (D300 w/grip may even be too snug)\n\nPROS: Very nice rugged feel. Rubber feet are solid and everything seems to be built solid. Well made for small to mid-sized DSLR with 2 lenses and a flash.

Very well built, highly customizable, and with HUGE room on the high vis yellow interior.\nNo need to go on with whats great about this bag...everything is great!\nI can only think of one con...maybe the shoulder strap...but I like it.  It's not a big deal to me for this inexpensive HUGE bag.\nWhat do I mean by HUGE?\nIt stores my Pentax K-x, my DA 55-300, Tamron 90mm macro prime, the kit 18-55 DAL, and my plastic fantastic DA 35mm prime, along with sets of batteries, the charger, a couple of polarizer filters, my lens pen, remote, cleaning kit, rocket blower, manual, cards, etc...and I didn't even come close to filling it up!  I have all my stuff in one durable bag with more room for new lenses and flashes and a sandwich if I want...\nUNBELIEVABLE bargain for what you get...\nDon't hesitate...buy...heck if you don't need massive storage think about the medium or small.",

Moving the dividers around to make this work was a breeze.\n\nI'll say this:  once you've had a bright-colored interior (yellow, in this case), you can never go back.

I can squeeze it in, but not much room left.  Only enough room for a couple of small primes and 430EX flash.  One side pocket is a mesh pocket and is best used for holding a water bottle.  The other pocket is good for SD cards, lens cleaning stuff, pens, and a couple of batteries.  There is plenty of space for manuals, maps, train or plane tickets in the cover and a pouch in front for holding thin items.  The hand and shoulder strap are great, and the bag is secure with snaps on each side of the lid and the front.

I'd recommend this highly to anyone, and my next case will be an Ape Case as well when I need to replace this one years from now.",

Not only could I EASILY carry all that, I am also able to carry around separate batteries for both the camcorder and the DSLR camera.  I also was able to carry the charger for both as well.  Plus I still have LOADS of room to carry other stuff.  I bought this and then a few months later used it for a 7 day Disney World vacation which I just finished.  This case was great.  It has a bright yellow inside which made it EASY for the security at Disney to check my bag. It has a wonderful strap which made it easy to carry around Disney.  Even my 12 yr. old son said it was easy to carry around.  It also has a hard/firm bottom and it feels like it is padded so that if it fell off the table or something, my camera would not be harmed.  Bottom line.  It is durable and comfortable at the same time.  I LOVE IT!",

There's not too much of any one feature, allowing you to pack in everything you need. For this reason I do like this bag a lot. I do have to complain, after about one year of heavy use flying around the country on different projects, that the build quality is somewhat lacking. After about two trips, the leather/velcro strap on the handles ripped apart. The handles are still intact though. Also in some places the stitching is now pulling apart; not badly, but it makes me worry. Other than that it's holding up okay. For the price, it's doing a good job. There aren't many bags on the market like this one, so your options are limited, especially in this price range. I'd buy it again.",

It has one large front zippered pocket, one smaller front zippered pocket and on good sized side zippered pocket.  This is enough for me to carry my filters, cleaning cloths and SD card case.

It has a great mesh pocket for a water bottle on one side and a small gear pocket that is good for pens, memory cards, batteries on the other side. The side and front pockets are thinner than I would want, but sufficient for my needs. My one year old has tested its durability, climbing all over it and rolling it around a bit.

After five months of use--including two vacations and plane trips--I couldn't be happier with my purchase.  Although this case is relatively compact, it's interior design, with removable and repositionable walls and separators makes this a case that can carry a surprising amount of stuff.  When I'm at home I can configure the case to hold all of my lenses and accesories (charging cable, cleaning supplies etc) but when I'm ready to hit the road I can quickly reconfigure so that my camera fits in the bag.  The adjustable storage areas also make it easy to adjust the compartments to the different lenses--I have everything in size from a 35mm fixed to a short telephoto.  I also like that the case has lots of exterior pockets which are handy for carrying other odds and ends, like pens, granola bars, cell phones and other small items.  Finally the case is comfortable to carry with it generously padded strap.\n\nIf you're looking for a DSLR camera case that is still relatively compact but can handle a lot of stuff, this is a good choice for you.",

After looking around forever trying to find a decent camera bag that wouldn't cost a couple hundred dollars, I stumbled on the Ape Case bags here on Amazon.  I love this bag and the yellow interior.  Very easy to customize to fit your needs.  Plenty of smaller pockets for some of your miscellaneous accessories.  I'm not a huge fan of the buckles on the sides, it seems a little redundant but after some careful consideration about cutting them off, I decided to leave them in case the zipper ever failed.  This bag is as good as any of the Lowepro or Tamrac bags that I looked at and you can't beat the price!  My only problem is that I wished that I would've went with the bigger bag rather than this one.  After some careful consideration about sending it back, I decided to keep it.  Even if I went with the bigger of the two, it still wouldn't take me long to fill it up.  I'm planning on buying another one in a couple of months after I pick up a couple more lenses and a few flash units.",

The exterior and interior dimentions listed are accurate. The only other measurement I would like to have seen on the listing is the heigth of the partitions.. They are 5\" and 7\" in height.  This should give you a better idea of what type of lenses can be stored.\n\nA few things that I would have prefered:\n\n  *  Another enclosed outside pocket vice the mesh one.\n  *  A shoulder strap with a thicker web and a non slip shoulder pad.  Some type of microfiber or rubber attached to the bottom of the strap to keep the bag from constantly sliding off.  I have the same problem with my smaller Canon bag.\n  *  A monopod strap.",

Everyone mentioned the superior quality so no problems there but the size issue seemed to come up quite a bit and that some people have returned their bags because of it. One person did not like the fact they had to remove the lens to put the camera in the bag. That the ajustable pads were either too short to be put across width wise and the long one was too long. This was dicouraging to read because I also do not like having to remove my lens to put the camera in the bag. Today I received my bag and was releived to see that not only was it more than adequate in size for my use that it was an easy fix for the lens on camera issue!! I simply rounded the larger pad around my camera (with lens on 58mm) at one end of the bag then attatched the remaining pads to it and to the sides of the bag ie radiating out like armes on a sun creating four addition pockets for lens flash etc. I really love this bag, best I've ever owned.\n\nlta, camera: olympus e620",

Expensive gear is only usable if it can be safely transported and found quickly, among other gear.  This case supposes that one always has a computer.  I don't, even though I have been digital since 2001 which is the start of digital!!!  That slot, if it was 3/4 of an inch wider, would be so much more useful.  It could hold flashes, and batteries without bulging the case.  ALSO the right hand pocket, if not like the left hand external pocket which is suggested for a water bottle,  was a little wider, that too could be useful, to hold an extra camera body, a flash, a lens.  Or even a Sandwich.  As it is, a NON over stuffed sandwich would have to be partially eaten to stuff in there.  Finally comes the carry handles.  They are not detachable, no way to hide them.  And I don't understand why they are needed, since a pro is going to use the shoulder strap.  IF I keep this case, I will probably use a sharp razor blade and just cut them off, but that affects my ability to sell them, return them and it makes them look chopped.  What is the purpose of those handles?  I think the designers should decide why, when. and under what conditions would the handles be needed.  In a pinch one can just pinch the bag somewhere and lift.  But carrying it via the handles cannot be done while shooting or working, so the photographer would be using the shoulder strap, therefore why not just pick up from that?  The handles as they are, block quick access when they are joined together and just flop in the breeze when loose.  Not needed. Big negative.  Needs more thought.",

I like the way the bag is built, very rugged and seems very well made. Even better, the price is very affordable, easily $80-100 cheaper to comparable camera bags I was considering. I can say enough about the Ape Case, everything I own now fits inside and I found it a pleasure to use covering Ohio State sports for the magazine I work for. I would say if you are replacing a current bag, I did utilize one of the Lowepro foam padded inserts to customize how I wanted everything to fit.

This one (the large) has enough room for my DSLR body, four lenses (various sizes), flash, and plenty of room for small side equipment.  Quality is great for the price.  You will want to keep your less-used stuff on the bottom layer so you don't have to dig through the Velcro pads.  The Velcro pads are unusual compared to other bags, and have some strange shapes.  Sometimes they have to be folded oddly for a good fit around different equipment.  The top of the bag seems annoying at first due to the zipper not going far around the back of the bag (padding is rigid).  Folding the top over the back will allow it to stay open.  Photographers with more than 4-5 lenses or really long telephoto should look for a bigger bag.  Great for light equipment and casual users though.",

It's even harder to find a local camera store with more than a few bags to lay your hands on.  So I weighed the reviews, paid the very affordable price and took my chances.  Turns out the Pro Medium Ape Case is exactly the right size for my Nikon D3100 system.  The camera with a 55-200 millimeter lens fits snugly in a horizontal position with enough room to store an additional lens of equal length vertically.  I use the remaining vertical slot for my battery charger and spare battery.  I don't have one, but I suspect a small external flash unit such as Nikon's SB400 would fit in that slot.  There are several other pockets and pouches to store batteries, chargers, filters, etc.  Unfortunately, none of those are big enough to fit David Busch's Compact Field Guide (also highly recommended) into.  That's a minor issue, though.  The ACPRO1200 looks good and seems well constructed.  Only time will confirm that.  Overall, I don't think I could have done better for the buck.\nUPDATE:  I now have Nikon's SB400 external flash and, as I suspected, it fits easily into the slot I was previously using for my extra battery and charger.  In fact, there's room beneath it for a couple of filter cases.  As for the battery and charger, I had no problem finding a place for them in one of the other pockets.",

                "review_body": "This shoulder bag fits my Canon 80D with grip, Sigma 50-500mm and hood (stored vertically for easy access), and my two prime zooms, both f2.8, (so wide bodied lenses with room to spare).  Can easily fit another  dslr and another 3-5 lenses and flash.  The pockets have ample room for filters and adapters.  This works very well for my outing bag when I go out into the field.  It makes it far easier to make lens changes in the field opposed to the backpack I had been using.  It gets heavy with all of that gear, but it is by no means uncomfortable.  I would not recommend it for long hikes if you have a lot of gear.  It is ideally suited for shorter distances and travel.\n\nIt is very well well made and rugged.  I love the double zipper opening on top.  Plenty of room for a laptop or tablet inside, manuals, or other slim profile storage needs.  It is the best value on the market, especially if you have very large prime lenses or pro zooms.",

                "review_body": "I found this product by searching forums for an alternate/better carry case for the Kemper Profiling Amplifier. The Kemper brand case was not in stock anywhere, and I needed something quickly to transport my KPA back and forth to gigs. This Ape Case did not disappoint, and it has some more room and storage options than the Kemper case and at a better value to boot.\n\nThe front to back dimensions of the primary internal compartment is perfect for the Kemper. There's a little room on each end and on top for other items, but it is not so roomy that the KPA moves about. Its an ideal dimension for this unit in my opinion. The additional storage compartments are very useful for a number of items, like strings, patch cables, batteries, tablet stylus (for your set list app) etc. Very well made and high grade material. This is also a better value than some of the higher priced alternatives listed in some of the forums.\n\nFor light to moderate duty and carrying your Kemper from gig to gig and taking reasonable care not to carelessly throw other equipment on top of it, this is a great case. It is not rigid, so it may not protect the front knobs on the kemper if you were to jam something into it. For that level of protection there are other, more robust and costly options available and you can find those in the forums as well.",

It is well padded, and the velcro attached dividers make it adaptable to many cameras and uses.  The zippered pouches and smaller pockets make it easy to organize batteries, SD cards, lens filters, etc.  The yellow interior makes finding black parts easy to spot in low light.  This is very nearly a \"perfect case.\"  The protection this case provides for your camera is very good, both in padding and water resistance.  But it is far from water-proof, not that such was expected.  But the shoulder strap is crap.  It looks cheap and is not comfortable.\n\nI recommend this case, particularly if you can get it on a sale, but even at full price it is good.  But, for comfort and utility expect to have to buy a replacement shoulder strap.\n\nUPDATE:\nI bought the Skooba Superbungee strap and with this modification the bag is just about perfect for carry-on with little fatigue.  Great case for keeping all the gear for travel (and even at home), but a little large for short photo shoots around town.\n\nI highly recommend this case, but for comfort you need a different strap.",

Most bags I saw started at around $150-, and this Ape Case Pro Large sized bag was less than a third of that price. While this bag was sized right to use for transporting my kit, it would have been very difficult to work out of this bag at an event. Everything would need to fit tightly against everything else but there was not room enough to keep two fully assembled cameras (with lenses, battery grips, flash brackets, etc.), along with spare flashes, battery packs, etc. If everything was completely disassembled and wiggled and placed \"just right\" it would fit like a brick... but this isn't a practical bag to work out of. I would have needed two of these bags, one for each camera and kit... and that is one bag too many for airline carry-on.\nOther than this \"Large\" bag being too small, I thought it was made to highest standards. Inserts were fitted with tight locking velcro and fully configurable. Bright Yellow interior made finding items easy under low light. Black shell would keep a neat appearance and offered a good amount of protective padding. Wide zippers were easy to use and its relatively squared shape would make it easy to stand or stack with other gear.\nBottom line... it is too small to work from with redundant gear. For everyone else, this is a GREAT bag and a true VALUE for the price.",

However if you want to wear it over your head so it is across your body you need to reverse the strap, and even worse, if you want to length or shorten the strap the centered support and padded section is not movable and it becomes uncentered. In addition, if you want to add a padded shoulder piece to really make it comfortable, you can't as all those available are straight. I use a Domke item that is held on by velcro straps and the padding is angled so thicker on one side than on the other. You can set it so it will slide along the shoulder strap which makes it most convenient if you want to carry the bag on one shoulder and then want to change to across your body. The pad will move to the right spot for whichever shoulder you are using and however long or short you make the strap. To get that ability, I have replaced the strap that came with the bag with another extra strap I have. Note, even when I throw away a bag as worn or used, I save the strap if it is still functional. That habit made this purchase a success. Otherwise it might have ended up being returned.",

Additionally, there is a set of straps along the bottom of the bag for you to carry your tripod (I'm not found of these though as they make the bag tilt backwards) and I have used them to hold a 52in. Targus Tripod. Furthermore, you can easily customize your Ape Case to fit your needs by changing/removing the padded Velcro inserts. The bright yellow lining of the Ape Case is yet another plus.\n\nThe front and right side pockets can be a bit snug depending on what you place in them. I do like the mesh pocket on the left to carry a water bottle or snacks. All in all, I think the Ape Case ACPRO 1400 is an above average back with plenty of room and functionality. If they can devise a better means of carrying a tripod this bag would get a 5 star rating from me. Hope this review is helpful.\n\nUPDATE (09/04/11): I've changed my rating from 4 to 5 stars. In my original posting I mentioned the tripod straps to be inadequate as the attached tripod made the bag tilt backwards. I have since purchased a Dolica Proline Ball Head Tripod (Model #: AX620B100 - Great Tripod!) and this has alleviated the rearward tilt. Obviously, the tilting was due to the larger width of the Targus tripod.",

Besides that hugh  lens, it fits a 70/200 with the house on, standing!\nthird, why not have some small zippers inside the bag to hold the more precious things you got. Think Tank got these and is well needed.\n\nBut it is a sturdy bag with a 15\" (maybe a 17\")  laptop/ipad 12.9\"  easily.

While this is true, it is a problem to fasten the tripod itself to the bag with the unusual straps provided, I found a workaround that is actually preferal to me. I used my tripod bag strap to attach it to the camera bag which allows me to access my tripod by the zipper compartment without having to strap and unstrap it from the camera bag itself. Also, this way, my tripod stays dry and clean, which I like much better. So my overall rating is a big 5 stars. The bag is very well made with a lot of room for my Canon Rebel T7 with with the 18-55 mm lens attached. plus room for my 75-300 zoom lens an several smaller ones. additionally once all these are in the case where they are easily accessible, there is a whole layer underneath the padding, the way it comes already configured which I never would have thought to set it up that way. There are many pockets for accessories, extra batteries whatever.The inside where you stick the velcro is not cheesy like with so many other bags I have bought. The fabric does not feel like it's pulling away from the sides. Most other bags made me feel like they would rip eventually and were difficult to attach because they would stick to everything. This bags has dividers that are made of nylon that feels more durable and is easier to move them around. Love this bag, I'm glad I spent the extra money, it was well worth it!",

For perspective on this review, I'm an amateur photographer with several camera bags of many different sizes. This bag fits my large Nikon D500 with the 16-80mm lens (see picture), a second long lens and a mini tripod, grip or flash easily, while still having plenty of room for cleaning materials, batteries, etc. The exterior walls are thick and sturdy; the bag stays firmly in a square even when empty. The interior walls have a satin-like fabric that handles dirt better than the soft cotton interiors. The removable walls have a nice amount of cushioning, as good or better than the Amazon Basics camera bags. The yellow interior makes the inside of the bag easy to see if you\u2019re shooting in the dark. The hardware attaching the shoulder strap is metal - which is good - but thin metal. The padding on the shoulder strap is permanently attached in the center of the strap, so you can\u2019t slide it in front or behind you easily. The best feature is that the shoulder strap attaches only to the body of the bag, so the bag won\u2019t fall open if you leave the top of the bag open for quick access. My main complaint is with the tripod straps in the front. They should use quick detach latches - like the lid uses - but instead the tripod must be threaded through two difficult to use adjustable straps.

At the same time I got the new Sony HDR-PJ790 so I definitely needed something bigger.  Added to the one Sony CX-110 I had, and two other point and click cameras, I had quite a bit to lug around when I wanted to take photos.\n\nThis arrived quickly, and is very well made.  I like that you can zipper the top shut to help hold out elements, but can simply snap it closed with the buckle on front for quick access when you don't need protection from the elements.  And as others have said, the yellow interior is just awesome when it's filled with black equipment.  Plenty of room for all 5 cameras and accessories.\n\nI haven't put on the shoulder strap so I can't attest to that, as I prefer using the grip to carry it anyway since generally I just have it in the back of my car when I'm going to shoot something, and open the hatch and pull out what I need.\n\nThe adjustable dividers helps as well since obviously everyone's going to have different layout needs.\n\nI was a little hesitant at first since I could get bags as large for half as much, but this is a good example of getting what you pay for.  I\"m just a hobbyist, and even I could justify spending more than $20 for something this size because it's just so much more functional than the other options.\n\nAll in all a great bag, and I'm happy with my purchase.",

Everything I wanted to have in the bag fits and I think I could even get my 70-200 f/4 and another small lens in the bag yet but it would be crowded.  I have an RRS L bracket on my 1D Mk II and it is a tight fit in this case due to the cameras wide width.  If I took off the bracket I'm sure it would fit with no problems.  This is not a fault of the bag but is mentioned for information only.\n\nOverall I'm impressed with the bag.  The side and front pockets could be a little bigger and possibly better designed but for the price what do you want.  Some have complained about the shoulder strap and while it could be padded a little better it's better than a few I've had in the past.  The yellow interior makes it very easy to see what you have in the bag and the rubber \"feet\" on the bottom of the bag add a little extra durability to the bottom.\n\nThe bag seems well made and comes with several dividers, I just wish they were a little sturdier but they are adequate.  If there was more Velcro on the inside of the bag it would be even more configurable but I was able to get it laid out like I wanted.  I'm sure you can buy a better bag for 3 or 4 times the price (I have) but this is a great knock-around case and would work even better with a non-pro model camera.\n\nIf they make a larger shoulder bag in the future I would buy it.",

                "review_body": "I bought this bag based on the scores of good reviews and I wasn't disappointed.  I have a sony dslr and three lenses plus chargers, cords, a point and shoot, manuals, tons of filters, lens cleaning accessories etc, this bag holds it all plus some.  The ultra bright yellow interior is great for finding exactly what you need.  If you're just working with one dslr camera this bag can be set up to easily place and remove your camera and gently support any attached lens, and I mean just about any lens large or small.  I love the way it cradles the camera in the position you use it in instead of having to cram it in upside down lens first as with my last bag.  It's pretty comfy when slung and so far I have no issues with the strap however it could be better.  My only pet peeves are the inside and outside zippered sleeves on the top flap, you really can't fit much of anything in them and when you stuff the mesh pouch closest to your camera you run the risk of that harsh material rubbing the upper part of your camera.  Besides for that it's the best thing since sliced bread.  I highly recommend for the price!\n\n3/5/2013 - I'm upgrading my review to five stars.  It's been a few months and I've rounded out my kit quite a bit and everything fits.  I recently added a flash, upgraded to a larger camera (a77), bought another lens, acquired a cleaning kit, bought some eneloop batteries with charger, and it still fits everything in addition to what was in the bag.  I feel I could fit more into it as well.  It's been an excellent kit bag.  I may be insane but it seems the more the I cram in there it almost molds to fit everything.  At first my new camera was an awkward fit where I had my older smaller one, a day later it seems to slip right in and out with ease.  I'm even more happy with this bag than I was when I purchased it.  Excellent buy.",

I wanted a case where I could carry my 7D2 and several lenses - including my 70-200 2.8 IS II, plus a couple of flashes, several remotes, straps, batteries, etc.  -  and it does.\nOne concern so far is the webbing/straps on the front (the zig-zag things) - the concept is great, but the execution is lame.  The pull-tight strings are cheap, the cinch-clamps very weak and should be on the upper side, not on the bottom - if you pull them tight, the loose ends flop under the bag.  I'll explain more with the pics.\nSo far, it's the only shoulder bag I've found which holds all that I want.\nUPDATE \u2013 I\u2019ve taken it on 1 basketball and 2 hockey shoots.  Is it perfect for me \u2013 no.  But it\u2019s closer. In addition to the above:\nThe carry handle and the shoulder strap are heavyweight and feel secure.  The shoulder strap attaches cross-corner \u2013 I\u2019d rather it connect centered, or on one side.  The crisscross shoestring webbing does work, but I\u2019d much rather have some decent straps, or loops for my own straps. The cinch-clamps do loosen constantly.\nSo, here\u2019s what\u2019s in my bag:\n7d MK II with attached 55-250 mm IS STM, 10-18 mm, 18-55 mm, and a 70-200 2.8 IS II.\n600 EX and 320 EX Flashes plus an 8-cell SF-18 battery pack.\nPair of Trigmaster remotes, 2 - 622C TXVR\u2019s and a 622C TX-ETTL.\nNeck strap, wrist strap, shoulder sling, a pair of convertible mittens, poncho, plastic bags, clamp, Vivitar filter set(s), various sized PL filters, camera batteries, charger, 12 AA and 4 AAA rechargeable  batteries, etc.\nI always carry a monopod, and the Joby tripod and a spare pair of eyeglasses.\nThere is a section for a thin laptop, and more than one zippered compartment for flat documents, manuals, or prints.",

                "review_body": "This bag replaced my nikon gear bag, which had started to fall apart after about a year.  Here is what I think after about 3 months of use:\n\n- construction:  It's obvious right away that the bag is tough -the nylon exterior is tough and firm, and the stitching is tight and clean.  On the interior, the liner and adjustable dividers are made of soild material with good stitching as well.  The Strap is padded well in just the right areas, and durable.  However, the adjustable strap ends, if not pulled tight after adjustment, will sometimes work their way out...not a great thing for a bag meant to carry thousands of dollars worth of rig.  A few teeth on the adjuster would have gone a long way.  The zippers move smoothly and finish clean.\n\n- ergonomics:  If you're a pro, or a prosumer, that likes to carry around more than one body and several lenses you have to know that a backpack is pretty much your only option.  That being said, this carries my D80 w/18-200, 50mm, sb200 (2), 600 and 900 flashes, extra batteries, chargers, manuals, filters, remotes etc etc with room to spare.  I know it's been said, but the yellow interior is a HUGE help when you're looking for your gear in there, and the configuration options for the interior dividers are many and varied, a bonus if you're trying to squeeze a bunch of gear in there.  The drawstring net pouch on the side is a nice touch.\n\n- usage:  if you're moving from place to place and shooting, forego using the zipper on the top and just use the clips.  The zipper is nice for keeping the elements out, but it's a hassle if you're in a hurry, so those clips are a very nice touch to keep things in place without zipping.  If you fill this thing up, it's going to get heavy, so you'll probably have to switch shoulders as you go, but still pretty comfortable despite the weight.\n\n- overall:  A great bag with a lot of interior space that would probably be perfect were it not for the sometimes unstable strap adjusters.  Highly recommended otherwise.",

I have a Canon 7D and use it with either a 24-70 or an 18-200 lens. There is enough room in the case to carry my little Panasonic video camera as well.\n\nPadding - excellent - bag is very well padded with no weak corners or seams. Everything is nice and tight and well padded to protect equipment.\n\nDividers - excellent - good velcro, lots of different shapes and sizes with a center partition option that works great. Dividers are well padded to prevent bumps and shock.\n\nStrap - well padded and contoured to prevent slipping off the shoulder. Slight issue of the clip not holding the strap tightly as it is set - it does tend to slip over time on all three of my cases.\n\nOrganization - this middle sized case could use a few extra pockets - it needs a pocket on the back. The side and front pocket don't offer enough storage. But there are interior pockets that make up for the lack of other pockets. One star off for not enough exterior pocket space.\n\nColor - that yellow color is PERFECT! It is so much easier to find little pieces of black or gray camera equipment with the bright yellow interior.\n\nDurability - I have heavily used this case for a year. Zippers still excellent, and no wear on the case. I use it in lieu of a purse when I carry a camera with me so it easily has weathered Costco shopping carts, car adventures, hiking, kids runny noses, and everything else I have been able to throw at it.\n\nSize - I use it with my canon 7d with either a 24-70 or 18-200 - or both, along with a nice Panasonic video camera stuffed into one of the partitioned off sections. Still room to stuff my wallet and cell phone.\n\nOverall - excellent case that I really love to use. I wish it had an extra pocket to increase its versatility.",

                "review_body": "I can't see how most pros would find this adequate, but I like it a lot. I've got a Nikon, so I wish the \"lens gap\" could be adjusted better for the off center DSLRs, and I find there's really not all that much flexibility despite the sort of modular look and the velcro holding the compartment dividers, but they give and move.\n\nIt works for me to carry the D5000 with the 55-200 lens attached, plus schlepping along a Canon FS-100, a Canon Elph, my Zoom H2 audio recorder and all the associated chargers, some spare batteries and sundry accouterments. Convenient to carry if you're not a photojournalist, in other words, but I don't think you'd find it spacious enough if you routinely rely on more than one DSLR body and a full suite of lenses. I use pictures as an adjunct to journalism, not the centerpiece of my work.\n\nI read one review that complained about the \"superfluous\" clips, but I think they keep the strain off the zipper which will add to the longevity.  The complaints about the strap being the weakest link in the chain are perhaps valid, but it's working for me and a strap can be swapped/replaced without much effort.\n\nThe yellow interior ROCKS. The plain black exterior that isn't covered with logos that scream \"steal me, I'm pawnable\" is a plus to me. As soft-bags go this was far and away the best I saw for the money, but again for pros it's likely not enough (and many prefer a hard case to better protect their investment - after all, I'm not carrying around a D700 or an EOS 50D and $2000-$6000 lenses.) Factor in PRIME shipping and it's a great value.\n\nUPDATE: mid 2013 and this is still a GREAT investment.  I typically stash 2 DSLRs with attached lenses and a variety of other gear including a blackRapid strap in this utterly reconfigurable bag.  I talked work into one since I take a lot of photos there, too, and carry a Cannon and several lenses including a 300mm -- my only real addendum is get the full-sized case.  They hold up well, and I can't imagine a better product unless you need something to carry still more accessories. (If Ape had another size up I'd go to 5 stars!)",

I started collecting more gear and needed more room, so I bought the Large.\nKit: Canon 5d, 24-70 lens, 70-200 lens, external mic, external flash, battery grip, lots of batteries, chargers, cleaning bulb, shoulder strap, and all the small bits and pieces.\n\nEven the Large is crammed to the brim with all that, and takes some thought on how to arrange things.  It's a house of cards and removing one item requires taking out multiple pieces to put it all together again.\nIf I leave the battery grip out, it actually all fits rather well, though.\n\nPadding is absolutely fantastic.  I wouldn't hesitate having this on a plane or getting knocked around without damaging the contents.  All that padding definitely takes away from internal capacity, so you don't have as much room as you might think you will.\n\nI love the internal dividers.  Padding is good, and the material is I think nylon, which doesn't collect hair and dust like full fabric (or is easily wiped off).\n\nThe shoulder strap is contoured so it sits farther inward towards the body so it's not hanging right on the edge of your shoulder and thus less likely to slip off.  There is also a grippy material to prevent slipping.\n\nI also ordered multiple mid-sized camera backpacks and this somehow fits everything together nicer than most of them.  Still deciding if I want to keep this as well, but I'm switching to an open-concept backpack where I can see and reach everything instead of moving 3 pieces to get to one at the bottom as I need to do with the Ape Case.\n\nIf you're sold on the shoulder bag form (as opposed to a backpack), you should definitely give it a chance.",

                "review_body": "Based on the glowing reviews, i bought the Ape case. I already own a Lowepro slingshot 200, a Kata dr-467 backpack, and have another Kata rucksack on the way, so my criteria for usability, ergonomic design, and build quality is pretty high. i shoot with nikon d90 and d300s, but wanted a messenger-style bag to replace my stolen Domke bug bag, which unfortunately, is no longer made. I basically needed a field bag i could shoot out of. The video and photos suggested this bag could hold two bodies. Theoretically, this is true. In practice, however, numerous design flaws and overall poorly-designed ergonomics make it far less than ideal for that application.\n\nWhere to begin? When the bag arrived, i did a double-take. Did i make a mistake and order the small? No, this is the 1400 model, the \"large.\" That aside, my first impression was overall positive: the bag was attractive and made of ballistic nylon, with yellow-colored foam padding inside. That's worth one star. The mesh pocket on the outside with a drawstring cord-lock looked a little cheap, however. It might be good for a lens cap, but not much else.\n\nOne problem is that the bag appears bigger on the outside than it is on the inside, unlike my Kata and Lowepro bags, which use available space well. There's a slight inward curve to the bag which does offer protection, but also makes the corners and sides bends inwards a bit, which can exacerbate space issues. more on this later...\n\nOpening the bag by the center-mounted click-lock, the rain flap flips up to reveal a yellow pocket with a business card holder. Ok, so far, so good. Then you have to raise the top of the bag to reach the main compartment. Inside the main compartment, there are two cutouts for camera bodies at either side and a middle 'lens section' with six slots. Each of these slots is maybe big enough for a small prime lens, but they are reconfigurable. It looks fine, until you start to put some gear in it.\n\nSo i had a gripped D90w/ a wide-angle tokina 12-24 lens w/reversed hood which i put in one side. You have to remove one of the velcro padded strips to fit a gripped body. In the other cutout, i attempted to put my d300s w/ tamron 28-75, no hood--which is a pretty small lens. No dice. there's not enough clearance to fit two bodies with lenses attached through the cutouts, unless you have small primes on both of them. Minus one star. I attempted a workaround: Removing the padding again, i placed the d300s vertically. it fit, but just barely. It would have been awkward had i had the grip on.\n\nThe bag does hold two bodies, but not both in the cutouts, lens-mounted. But with even one body in the cutout, the lens compartments are fairly inaccessible. I did manage to get the following gear inside the bag: d90w/12-24 (Horizontal in cutout); d300s w/28-75(vertical); 50-150. It was a tight fit. But when i switched the 50-150 to the d300s, there was even less room.\n\nHere's where another major design flaw comes into play: there's no separation between the lens attached to the camera and the lenses or other items in the dividers. So in practice, your lenses will be knocking and rubbing together the entire time they're in the bag, unless you lay it down on a flat surface.\n\nEven worse, there was no room to fit the flash inside the bag. I tried it in various locations--the external mesh, the internal top flap pocket, the external top flap pocket--but it seemed like an inelegant compromise. My sb-600 flash is a mid-sized nikon, so it's not the biggest flash they make. Without the diffuser, it fit into the other side pocket, but i had to remove the eneloop AA batteries which i had tucked into the elastic loops. And, that compartment isn't padded, either. So, again,a  less than ideal situation--you can't have your flash with diffuser ready to shoot in that pocket. you'd have to take the flash out, and then put the diffuser on, possibly missing a shot in the process. and, you can't store a flash and extra batteries in the same pocket. The flash will fit in the front pocket, which has a double-zip, a padded pocket with a mesh front on one side, and three nylon sleeves on the other. If you put it in the filter pocket, it's at least partially padded, which is somewhat reassuring considering its the first line of impact against bumps, but then it would require a two-handed zipper pull and another zipper pull before it can be extracted.\n\nThe niggles dont stop there, unfortunately. The shoulder strap is cheap and the pad can't be adjusted. You can adjust the length, but it's just not a quality strap.\n\nThe biggest niggle, though, is that the side-position cutouts make it awkward to remove the camera. Because the sides and top of the bag curve inwards, positioning your camera this way makes it swallow the edges of your body. It's better to pull out a body by the body--not the lens, which could strain the mount--but it's difficult to do this one-handed. Just not a smooth draw. It's like you're fighting with the bag. If you have to put the bag down to get the camera out, it kind of defeats the purpose.\n\nThis could cause consternation in the field, or worse, damage your equipment. You can avoid the cutouts--that would be my recommendation--and place the camera(s) face down with the lens pointing at your feet. There's enough room for a gripped camera with w/a or telephoto lens, but two bodies mounted this way leaves little room in the bag for anything else.\n\nYou also have to be careful with a d90, for instance--a couple of times, i opened the memory card door just trying to get the camera out. The d300s has a more solid grip and a slightly different door design so less of a problem there.\n\nI was about to give up on the Ape Case when i discovered a workaround: if you avoid the cutouts altogether, the ergonomics get much better. Reconfiguring the yellow dividers to the center--it took me a while to figure this out--it is possible to store the camera in ready position. you can use the divider thingys to make an oval-shaped lens cradle and slot the camera in it. on the other side, there's room for the flash w/diffuser (yay!) and a compact zoom or a prime. at either side, you now have storage space in two \"hidden compartments\" plus additional berths on top. best configuration for the 'storage bins' would be stuff you don't need to access frequently: cables, chargers, rocket blowers, extra battery, etc. you can also fit either a medium telezoom or 1-2 small lenses.\n\nwith this set up, i was able to fit:\n*d90w/grip+ tokina 12-24w/hood reversed or d300s w/50-150/2.8 hood reversed\n*sb-600 flash; tamron 28-75/2.8\n*nikon 70-300 ED\n*sigma 30/1.4; sigma 15/2.8 fisheye\n\n...all in the bag.\n\ni still had room in the two 'top' containers, the side battery compartment, and the front zip compartment.the setup was heavy but not unbearable, thanks to the Ape Case's well-padded back panel. it would have been nice had there been a slot to thread a hipbelt to help stabilize the load.\n\nbottom line: the Ape Case 1400 is more of a medium-small than a large. i wouldn't recommend overstuffing this bag. it works best as a one-body set up with nothing too exotic, though you can store a second body with body cap on. if you want to be able to access the camera quickly, set it up in the middle of the bag. otherwise, you could encounter issues.\n\nOn the plus side, the case seems fairly rugged, and well-padded. And the price is inexpensive.\n\nBut the Ape Case 1400 is clearly a notch below more expensive offerings from Kata, Lowepro, Tamrac, and Tenba in terms of build quality and  ergonomics. i ordered the Lowepro Stealth Reporter 550 AW for my 'pro' 2-body setup, and maybe i'll set this up for casual, one-body shooting.",

After reorganizing the internal dividers (I completely removed one of the divider slats), inside the main compartment I have been able to fit my 50-300mm zoom lens, the external flash, about 12 filters, the battery charger, the body with the 18-55mm lens attached, & have created a slot for the easy access of my user manual. If I had a small compact camera (elph), I could probably fit that in with the manual. All is snug and comfortable. There is not any excess room and extra bulk. The exterior zipper pockets have plenty of room for my memory cards, data cable, and all other misc..\n\nCONSTRUCTION: The bag appears to be well made. I worked as a luggage engineer for a few years & I know what to look for. The fabrics are durable and the stitching is solid. The YELLOW interior is great! It really makes finding things easier. I would have preferred a mid to dark grey exterior to the black, but that isn't really a complaint, just a preference. My only concern would be the shoulder strap may need stronger stitched reinforcement where the webbing joins the pad. Perhaps they have internal bartacks, but I didn't feel them easily. The swivel snaphooks that connect the strap to the bag make it easy to change the direction the strap fits. The strap uses metal hardware and should not break easily. Overall the hardware for the bag is ergonomic & feels good in your hands.\n\nI am very happy with my purchase. Great bag, especially for the price... Can't be beat!",

                "review_body": "This is all the camera bag you'll need. Truly. Are you surprised at this statement? You should be...the Ape Case AC Pro 1400 is priced at just under $50.00!!! If you need something bigger then don't buy a \"bag\" buy luggage.\nAt such a low price point you'll be amazed at the embarrassment of features this bag brings to the fight.\nIts tough on the outside and generously padded on the inside with the standard modular dividers et al.\nIt's roomy - I can fit my Canon 5D, 35mm Canon Rebel, 28-105mm, 50mm, 85mm, 24mm, 70-200mm, three speedlites, four batteries, charger, card reader, lens filters, various cords, cleaning kit and many other items and still have room left over.\nI read a review recently on the Adorama site where the reviewer complained about the shoulder-strap. I don't know what he/she was talking about. If your shoulder cant survive the supplied shoulder-strap see your doctor...you have physical issues that need immediate attention. I personally like the strap. I think its comfortable and adequate.\nThe zippers and hardware are built to last.\nI can fit my Manfrotto tri-pod easily and securely into the supplied straps on the lower front of the bag but I choose not to since it comes with its own case already. But just in case I ever needed to...\nBest of all, and the reason I STEPPED DOWN $20+ dollars to buy this case (after comparing similar camera bags), the interior is YELLOW!!! I LOVE IT! Now, I have really good eyes BUT, that still doesn't mean that I can find stuff in the bottom of a black hole. Unless you have developed a set of fingertips fit for reading braille, I recommend a yellow interior in your next camera bag.\nDid I mention that it was priced under $50.00?!?!\nHonestly, I don't know why this bag is priced so low...I really don't. Get it while you can.",

                "review_body": "I use this bag to hold 3 Nikon D5100's with battery packs, 5 lenses, a Zoom H4n, two wireless mics, 2 shotgun mics, all the chords, all the adapters, and I use it often.\nI would not trade this bag for any of the over-priced options that I was considering.\n\nCons - There could be some more possible customizations with more/different Velcro inserts. The strap that Velcros from the laptop section to the main compartment won't stay out of the way when you move it. It could use a bit of Velcro on its top and a corresponding piece on the outside of the bag to secure it when you are needing to access the area that it spans. However, I use that area for sound equipment instead of a laptop; most people won't need to go in and out as much. The handles seem cheap and could use some Velcro to keep them together, rather than being buttoned.\n\nPros - The amount of gear it holds and the system you can develop to compartmentalize your stuff is amazing. The strap allows you to shoulder the load well. Mine is supporting what seems to be 20 - 25 pounds. There is no visible wear at the strap's contact points. I got what I wanted in the dual zipper opening. There is a handy business card holder inside the top flap, I use it and it is very accessible. There is also an elongated pouch up top for my most important chords (camera-data chord and video to monitor chord). There is a couple of pouches, one at either end. The forward facing pouch is a generous netting that keeps small accessories that you will access often and need rapidly. The other is a zippered pouch that offers an item a bit more privacy while still being readily available.\n\nIt's been years now and the bottom is holding together, the corners are holding together, the color is still sharp, the zippers all still work, and the sewing is still secure (no frays). I really doubted this purchase when I was looking around; ultimately the low price convinced me to choose. I am very, very proud of this bag and happy with the duty that it has pulled. I highly recommend this product, regardless of its affordability.\n\nMax Morris with M. Morris Picture Co.",

                "review_body": "This is my first bag from this company but I am very pleased with it.  Well made, solid protection for your cameras and accessories.  This is the large bag and is good to travel with the casual photographer.  If you put the right equipment in there you should have a well rounded selection in which to take photos in a variety of situations/circumstances.  The bag is relatively comformtable with the shoulder pad in the strap and cost wise it is a little cheapr than say LowPro or other solid brands names on the market.  I feel it is just as good as the higher end brands for a standard bag.\n\nThe interior is well padded and has the many velcro walls in which you can changes positions/partitions to make things fit to your needs.  Again this is not a huge bag so make sure you know what you need or what your trip or assignment is if you are a pro who lives off your photos.\n\nI am not a professional but I do have three bags, another similar to this and I have  much large one that can fit 4 SLR's and many lenses/attachments.  This bag should be good for the standard traveler or hiker or wandering around a city or beach.\n\nThe bag has a nice appearance and a cute ape being that is the firm name and logo.\n\nFor me purchasing through Amazon is 99% always a good experience even with Market Place sellers as well. Remember if you are buying via Amazon they have a great return policy with most items being 30 days so even purchase this items, test it and if not what you like or want you can return it providing it is still new and all contents are returned in the original packaging.",

                "review_body": "What an absolutely fantastic case.  What you get for under $50 is absolutely amazing.  This case BEATS camera bags from the more well known companies costing twice as much.  It absolutely smacks them down in quality, construction and value.  The padding on the sides is outstanding.  It is the best example of a really good, and reasonably lightweight case that I've seen in many years.  Plenty of room inside for my Sony A6000 with Sony SEL16-70 Zeiss zoom, two prime lenses (Sigma 19 and 30) and the Sony 55-210 zoom.  Plus, a Nissin flash, various filters, accessories and cleaning supplies, extra batteries.  Wow.  I bought a simple, poorly padded bag insert from another, more famous company that cost more than this case!  I returned it because I was, quite simply, disgusted.  Ordered this case instead.  So glad I did.  The exterior material is tough and the strap is pretty decent, all things considered.  There's even room to tuck it away in the lid.  The one thing I would change is to put a little more padding in the bottom of the case.  I rectified that by simply laying out a padded lens wrap underneath the dividers and then reinserted the dividers.  All in all, this is THE case to hold my entire Sony e-mount system.  It's a little larger than I may want to take with me to the field, as I'll seldom take everything with me anyway (and that's why I have a smaller Ape Case messenger bag and some older Domke lens bags), but I'm really glad I found one case to pretty much fit all my stuff.  Great quality, amazing price, easily the best value bag out there, particularly if you have a mirrorless system with more than just a couple lenses.  I'm very, very impressed.  Their smaller bags, like the messengers, are pretty nice, too, if a little sparsely padded.  Not this thing.  It's a tank for your gear.  Well done, Ape Case.  You've got a huge fan here.",

                "review_body": "When I first saw the name \"Ape Case\" on this camera bag, I didn't think much of it, except,  \"what a goofy name\".  So, just out of curiosity, I clicked on the product link, on Adorama, actually, and just had to take a look.\n\nI really liked the bright yellow interior, and the reviews were overwhelmingly positive.  And the price was right in the neighborhood to fit my budget.\n\nI finally narrowed my choices down to the Ape Case, but didn't know which one, the Medium, or the Large bag.  I decided to go with the Medium, as it was a bit cheaper, and figured if I didn't think it was big enough, I'd send it back and go with the Large.  Well, it turns out that my Canon T2i wearing a battery grip with 18-55mm kit lens, 55-250mm f/4-5.6 IS zoom, Speedlite 430, battery charger and cord, camera and lens owners manuals, Lens Pen, video and USB cables, lens caps, set of filters, timer remote, and probably a few other things all live in the Medium size bag, still with room to spare... I think I could still get at least 2 more lenses in there comfortably... room to grow!  The only difference between the Medium and the Large, is that the Large is about an inch or so deeper, the length and width measurements are the same.  If you have a full frame Pro body like an EOS 1D or similar, or some longer zooms, you might want the Large bag, for the extra depth.\n\nOne thing I am having a bit of a dilemma with, though, is creating the optimum arrangement in the main compartment.  As the bag comes, everything fits perfectly in the compartments as they are arranged, as long as I have the 18-55mm lens on the body... but the 55-250mm zoom will not fit when installed on the body.  So, I removed one of the dividers (they are held in place by velcro) and rearranged the remaining dividers to make room for the body and tele zoom installed.  But now, that left me with 2 less \"compartments\", but actually more \"room\".  All the dividers are removeable, so you can customize this bag to your needs.  You just have to decide exactly what your needs are, and how to arrange your bag.\n\nThe divider that is made for the body and  installed lens actually elevates the body/lens up off the bottom of the bag, making a \"secret compartment\" under it where you can store seldom used parts like the body cap or ???.\n\nThe bag has excellent construction, and good thick (feels like a closed cell foam) padding.  Unless the bag gets run over by a truck, or sat on by an elephant, everything inside will be well protected.  I've not had it in the rain yet, but I think it would take quite a downpour for any water to make it's way inside. The bag top is held shut by a double zipper, and then secured with a plastic snap clasp on both sides and in the center also.  If you hide both zipper handles under the front flap, then secure all the snap clasps, it would be quite difficult for anyone in a crowd to get their hand inside the bag without you knowing about it... it's good and secure.  But, that same security also means that it does take a bit of doing to get inside yourself, also.  If you need quick access, you could leave the zippers open, and just secure the front clasp, but sacrifice some of the security.\n\nThe shoulder strap has a rubberized pad on it, and it stays on my shoulder fairly well.  It gets the job done.\n\nThere are zippered pockets on the top cover and flap, inside and out, on the right side of the bag outside, and the front of the bag outside.  The left side of the bag outside has a mesh pocket secured with a drawstring and keeper ball.  I haven't figured out yet what to keep in there, I wish it was another zippered pocket instead, to be honest.  I guess it would be good to carry an 8-pack of AA batteries for the Speedlite.\n\nIn all, I'm pretty satisfied with the Ape Case Medium bag.  Excellent protection for everything inside, the bright yellow interior makes it easy to see dark colored items like lens caps and lens pens, and it has enough room inside of all my stuff and then some.",

                "review_body": "Holding what it promises.\nI purchased this case many months ago. The case is holding up for pro and daily use - still looks like new and is fully functioning. It is the detail and good worksmenship what makes the difference.\nAt first, I did not give much for the yellow inside color, but found out soon that this is a great idea - you can find everything even in low light. I just came back to this item now, because I need an additional smaller bag. I will try now the small ape case after I made such a good experience with the large bag.\nThere is one thing I like to complain  a bit about.\nThe small deficiency is the carry strap - very bad strap - has a rubber like shoulder part which is very stiff and uncomfortable - strange, such a good bag with such a bad strap. Nevertheless, I still recommend to buy this bag and recommend to just get another strap for it - easy to find a vast variety and cheap straps - not easy to find such a good camera bag. I bought a \"Victorinox Comfort Fit Shoulder Strap\" for it which is a bit expensive but the best of the best and truly makes 20 lbs feel like 5 lbs. You can find this strap at Amazone under the above name for about 30 dollars - yes it is a lot of money for a strap but your shoulder is worth the investment - Victorinox is truly the best. The ape case itself is very good and very reasonable priced for the high quality - worth to get a separate strap. I gave anyway 5 stars because this bag is great, looks good, and is holding up to serious daily abuse.\nThe padding is good and sufficient that I don't worry about my equipment even in a rough environment. In the main compartment, it has enough space for two full size SLR pro size bodies with battery grip - one of them with a larger lens mounted, a flash, and 3 additional large pro lenses. Side and front compartments are large enough to fit all other accessories, charger, cables, light meter etc.. Lot's of space. I use this large bag for bigger jobs like shooting a wedding or certain commercial jobs to have everything with me for all eventualities - my bag has therefore to carry a weight of 28 lbs. It's just a good bag...",

                "review_body": "You can spend hundreds on high end Pro cases - and of course if you need a case like that it's money well spent with regard to protecting your photographic equipment.\n\nMy perspective is value in relationship to price and to this regard APE cases are hands down one of the most well thought out, toughest and intelligently designed cases on the planet - they offer tremendous bang for your buck. Not to mention they're built like a tank.\n\n* Heavy, thick outer shell with baseball stitching all around and on every seam. Baseball stitching is the strongest stitch there is.\n\n* Easy to customize interior, top quality protected foam encased in screaming, vibrant yellow tight weave nylon which really does make finding your equipment in low light situations a breeze.\n\n* 15 thick padded dividers and compartments, means plenty of room for everything from additional lenses, filters to your SD cards, back up batteries, chargers and manuals.\n\n* Double re-enforced thick rubber shell over nylon handle has metal rivets on each side. This means this bag can A LOT of weight without a single worry.\n\n* Top Quality steel zippers are snag free and double locking. The metal hardware on these cases will impress you.\n\n* Hard bottom with rubber feet keeps the case stable and above the ground - especially important if conditions are wet.\n\n* Bottom Tripod straps allow you to carry along a tripod with ease. The forward mounted straps mean easy removal and packing back up.\n\n* Wide, superb quality shoulder strap with padded, non slip center is excellent. The strap had steel clips which clip onto steel support rings. The strap is fully adjustable and comfortable.\n\n* Outrageously good build quality - this  semi soft/hard case is built like a hummer. Close to the protective advantages of a quality aluminum case at a fraction of the cost.\n\n* Nice mesh side pockets on the outside - great for filters.\n\n* Thick nylon outer straps with ABS plastic snap open and close locking systems.\n\nSome reviewers have complained that APE cases take to much time to open and close, due to the double closing and opening systems. It's true APE cases may have put in a little overkill in this regard. However my view is considering the investment I have in my cameras - a few extra moments to ensure their protection is time well spent.\n\nI have cases by Billingham, Ona and others. In hindsight they're far too expensive and in every way compatible to\nCaseCrown which are very good and inexpensive. They have lot's of bells and whistles, I  have one for my Panasonic Pro HMC40 video camera. The case is a bit of a hybrid between soft and hard shell cases but it fails in comparison to the Ape case in most every respect. That said, I'll be replacing it with an APE case - I'm that impressed with them.\n\nLike all things in life, sometimes it's important to base your buying decision on what you need rather than what you want. In this regard if your looking for a good case for an inexpensive point and shoot - these may not be your best bet as you can pick up a very suitable case by brands like Case-logic or Amazon Basic cases for twelve bucks - and they'll serve you quite well.\n\nAs for APE cases - I'm now a die hard fan. Versatile, protective, innovative design meets function and all at a price that makes sense. Especially when again, you've made an investment in photographic equipment. APE cases pay for themselves in the safe guards they provide, the ability to reconfigure the interior to fit your equipment - and that vivid, maniac yellow interior is sensational.\n\nHighly Recommended.",

So, this was the best I could find at 67mm to serve as a replacement.  It is too large for the Olympus fisheye lens, however, I modified the cap by molding strips of electrical tape around the edges of the cap at 4 corners and building up the thickness by a couple millimeters so that the cap actually fits snugger and more securely on the lens than the original OEM cap.

Personally, I like it that snug because most original Super 8 camera bags don't have a lot of extra room, so it's easy to knock off the lens cap when taking the camera in and out of the bag, especially if you've got a filter on the lens.

On these Kaiser caps, the size is the inside diameter of the cap, so that, for instance, Pentax film lenses that take 49mm filters need a 51mm Kaiser cap.  Presumably Nikon lenses that take 52mm filters will need a 54mm Kaiser cap. In general, try a size about 2mm bigger than the filter size of the lens. You want the outside diameter of your lens, NOT the filter size.\n\nThere are so many complaints here about customers having gotten the wrong size that you would think the seller would want to make this more clear.\n\nAnyway, I got the right size on the second try, and the caps work well, but I won't be buying any more at the current price.",

                "review_body": "I got this case recently with the idea of putting my Canon EF 70-300 IS USM (non DO) inside and throw in a backpack with no other form of protection. The case fits the lens well closing completely. As a matter of fact, it is quite wide and fits the lens with the relatively large hood reversed. The construction seems OK, although the padding is less dense than I would have liked. This is a soft case and I can feel every protrusion of the lens through the fabric without applying too much pressure with my hand. In this regard I am not sure about the protection the lens will get in a backpack full of other stuff.\n\nThe filter compartment at the bottom is a good idea but not for naked filters as the bottom of the case is not hard enough to really provide much protection. I guess I could cut a couple of round pieces of cardboard and attach then to the filter pocket and that would do. Alternatively, the pocket is large enough to keep a couple of filters (58mm) in the plastic box they came in but this is certainly not a very convenient solution, especially if you use your filters frequently. This is one of the occasions in which round filter cases would make soooo much sense! The filter compartment can be used to store not only filters but wipes and other small items as well. Again, I like the idea.\n\nAll in all this is a good product. It affords more protection than a Zing pouch without the added weight of a hard case. I took one star because of the lack of a hard bottom in the filter compartment and the -apparently- less than ideal amount of padding.",

On a weekend trip where the only extra lens I carried was in this pouch I had it clipped to a carabiner on the outside of a small messenger bag and after several hours noticed that the stitching securing the tab had almost totally unravelled. Had this completely come apart the pouch with the lens inside would have fallen off and landed on the sidewalk. Fortunately I noticed this and put it inside the bag and carried it inside for the rest of the day. That night, to my wife's amusement, I was able to adequately reattach the tab with the little sewing kit in the hotel room. It held securely the next day and when we got home I had a friend bartack it with a sewing machine. Overall I like the case and would purchase another if needed, just check the stitching.",

I had trouble with other heads that either had a floppy quick-attach mount or a floppy 3-Way head.  I only needed 2-Way and didn't need a quick-attach which I didn't trust not to drop off.  Everything on this is solid aluminum except the little triangular locking collar for the 1/4\" bolt going into your camera and the handle grip. The locking collar has a threaded metal insert though so I think it will be fine.  Even the small lever you see on the side for locking the camera mount swivel is aluminum.  Very durable it looks like something was made in the \"good old days\" - made to last.  Made in Japan.\n\nThe plastic handle locks both tilt and pan at the same time, or loosens them both for movement.  Its not a fluid head but it can be snugged to allow controlled movement smooth enough for anything but video I would think.",

                "review_body": "It works very well. The stand will tip over if you don\u2019t add a lot of weight or clamp it down. To make it work they would need to at least double the weight and it\u2019s quite heavy as is. I suspect the price would need to go way up and especially shipping cost. You might be better with the bench clamp but my workbench top was to thick for it.  My stand was rusted in several places but Amscope took care of it. Their support was top notch. Dustin and Travis are two professionals that answered my slew of questions and were a pleasure to work with. If not for the rust and no mention that the stand easily tips over, I would have given it five stars. The included light is not very good but their 144 LED light is great and is reasonably priced. Over all I am happy with it.",

Not much more to say beside it seems to be well made and out of durable plastic, and it even has an embedded metal 1/4\"-20 threaded insert on the bottom for the tripod to screw into, which makes it much more durable than plastic alone.",

                "review_body": "I love the design on this body cap\u2014it's unique, and it complements the styling of the Nikon F2 I'm using it for. HOWEVER... there's a concern to be aware of: you may find that the body cap becomes \"stuck\" when trying to remove it.\n\nNow, to be clear, this might only be a problem with older Nikon F-mount cameras, because none of the other reviews I've looked at mention this.\n\nAlthough it twists into place easily, there's a FIRM resistance when removing it... and I absolutely panicked for a moment when I LITERALLY couldn't get it off. Luckily, I realized that you simply need to firmly pull the cap outward (away from the camera body) while rotating it off. It's weird... it requires a bit of back-and-forth twisting while doing this. So, it's definitely tricky. And I couldn't quite determine what part it's getting stuck on.\n\nAgain, this might only be an issue with Nikon's vintage film cameras... the older bodies probably just have a very minor design difference in the mount. But it's still a concern. Just be cautious if you're using this for an older F-mount body.\n\n(I realize that this body cap was probably NOT designed with 50 year-old cameras in mind, which is why I'm still giving it 5 stars overall. It still works!)\n\n[UPDATE 11/26: I'm bumping the rating down from 5 to 4 stars. I was able to test this cap on another early F-mount body, and unfortunately ran in to the same problem, so it wasn't just my camera that had a compatibility issue. While the cap still fits okay, I'm worried that it could cause panic for others trying to use it. If you have a Nikon DSLR, it's probably fine, but just be cautious with vintage Nikon cameras.]",

I bought it so I could darken the bright skies to bring out more of the blue while leaving my subject in bright light.  With another lens, I could give my white clouds an orangy tint.  Fun to play with.  Don't worry about the lens falling off it holder, the plastic holder grips it in place so all you have to do is slide the lens up and down for whatever effect you want.  It can hold up to 3 lens to use at a time.",

I can mount my strobes to it.  Basically, if it has a 1/4 thread or 5/8 stud mount, you can hook it to this sucker and go.",

F2.8 is wide enough for 90% of shooting scenarios, but, of course, if you find yourself shooting in very low light you may want to consider the Sony instead. The Sony fe 14mm has a wider aperture at F1.4, it's a sharper, and it has slightly less CA and distortion. The only compelling thing on that list is the aperture for low light performance, the rest you'll have to look really hard to tell the difference in any practical shooting scenario. This comes down to your budget. If you need the ultimate in performance, the Sony brand lens is your way to go. If you need a 14mm lens now that gets you so close that most people couldn't tell the difference, then save around a grand and buy the Samyang. It's a great option.",

                "review_body": "I bought this lens to use on my a7s2 in order to create walk-through videos of homes for Realtors.  I need a fly-by-wire lens to do this because in order to create these videos FAST (that's important since the customers don't like to pay a lot for these basic basic basic videos) you need to shoot in S-Priority so that the camera can take control of the aperture and open it up and close it down as it sees fit as light levels increase and decrease when you walk through the house filming.\n\nThis lens had a good bit of barrel distortion but I was willing to forgive that because I felt that it was likely that the customer would never really notice.  I was happy that it could go to 2.8 and let double the light into the camera that my previous f4 lens could.\n\nThe deal killer though was the aperture control.  It wasn't smooth like my 16-35 f4.  Instead of seamlessly opening and closing the aperture it would wait to do so...then make a big jump.  Like...a full stop of light jump as compared to how my 16-35mm would adjust on the fly in 1/10th of a stop increments.  The result was that the light levels would jump up and then jump down as the amount of the light in the scene changed.\n\nThis wasn't workable.  I dunno if the lens was designed to only adjust in 1-stop increments when used in S-Priority mode or if this was due to the fact that the lens couldn't \"talk\" to the camera efficiently enough to know to make the adjustments faster and thus more smoothly.  Either way, it had to go back and was replaced with the significantly more expensive 12-24mm f4.  Sure, I lost the extra stop of light and sure I didn't want to spring for the extra coin...but the downsides to this lens were not acceptable trade-offs for what I do.",

My only issue so far is in video this lens has a lot of breathing which can be a deal breaker for some.  I also wasn't aware that I could not update the lens firmware unless I spend another $60-70 on a dock for the lens so that is very disappointing to me.

So, we ordered new Bushnell binoculars (because of the brand name) and we have never been happy with them!  We are taking an extended driving trip and wanted some great binoculars.  My husband did not like the \"Coleman\" name but I ordered them anyway.  What a great surprise!  These binoculars are FANTASTIC!!  Love the exterior coating that makes them easy to grip and handle.  Sight through them is SO MUCH BETTER than the Bushnell ones which cost way more money!  Even my husband loves them!  I haven't been in a situation where they might fog up (like our Bushnells did whenever we went from cold to hot) but these are supposed to be fog-proof which will be wonderful (no more waiting for them to clear up)!!  I would compare these to some binoculars which cost more than double what we paid!  Thank you COLEMAN for making such an awesome product!",

The only ones I found that were clear and resolute enough in this power and price range were the Bushnell Powerview 16x50/20x50 models and the Coleman Signature 16x20. This Coleman has to be the best buy in this price range, considering features and optics. The view, although somewhat narrower than less powerful models, is very clear with outstanding clarity and resolution, enough to view the tiny bullet holes on the long distance targets of my shooting range. The build seems to be good. They have nicely designed rubber covered twist up eye pieces. The lens covers are also rubber-like, instead of plastic and fit tightly. The eyepiece lens covers are one piece and clip to the strap. Some online stores describe these erroneously, I believe, as having BK7 prisms. The pair I received have the better BAK4 prisms. \"BAK4\" is stamped on the body of the binoculars and noted on the box. Scoop these up while you can. I took a chance on these as there were no reviews available.  I'm thrilled that I did! By the way, an online search I conducted identified the Coleman binoculars as a joint effort by Coleman and Olympia.",

HOWEVER, there is a BIG flaw that compromises this bracket.  The tolerances between the two pieces are two great, so that the side piece \"wiggles\" even when locked down. I had THIS problem out of the box.  Over time these two pieces are going to start to wiggle even more.  Unfortunately, this L-Bracket needs to be redesigned.",

The reason I like this one over the RRS L Bracket is that you can change the battery without removing the bracket or the L portion of the bracket.  I am sure it is not as structurally sound as the RRS bracket but the fact is that Fuji Batteries need to be changed out regularly and it is easy to do with the L bracket.  You simply loosen the screw that you see in the picture at the end and the vertical portion slides down revealing the battery door.  You don't fully remove the L portion of the bracket so there are no parts to be lost.  I think that is my main reservation about the RRS bracket is that you have to completely remove the L portion and screw and I can see dropping the screw while in the field.\n\nFor this bracket, I find it bottom part of the bracket very well built and molded to the shape of the Fuji GFX so it won't slip.\n\nI recommend this.",

The side component screws to the bottom part but the screw mechanism can never be tighten enough to provide for a solid, no wiggle, fit.  This means that the side bracket is loose and has a lot of wiggle room and at times it just gets loose.  Every so often you need to tighten the screw.  My camera fell out of this bracket and fell to the ground once, incurring damage to the body and possibly a lens.  This is a shame as this is not a cheap bracket.  I have several Fotodiox brackets for Sony and they are great.  Skip this one.",

It is designed well to fit concise.\n- Works excellent with a RRS (Really Right Stuff) bracket.  It does not slip at all which is a problem I have had in the past with other third party brackets.\n- I do not own any of the other brackets but the concept of this one for enabling the battery changing makes the most sense to me and it does work well.  All you need to do is loosen the screw and slide it down and you can change the battery.  Also, if you are in a shooting situation where you won't need to use the vertical side of the bracket it is easy to remove which is a nice option to me.\nI really like this bracket and I feel it is a great value when comparing it to the alternatives.",

But optically and aesthetically, they were the same to me.\n\nI finally found a parfocal 3rd eyepiece for my phototube. For ~20 bucks. That's a win!\n\nPS: if you hold it by the two ends and unscrew, it comes apart pretty easily. You can clean easily and more importantly try to realign the lenses if you get the impression the image is not focusing evenly (radially).",

That being said, it's made of metal, the finishing coating and markings seem (and are likely) very durable. I have high confidence that years from now it won't look tattered and scratched (The way that my OMD-EM5 Mii looks brand new. The hood goes on smoothly and has no \"jangle\". I should note that the \"screw\" that tightens it seems closer to a gun metal grey and it seems to be treated for that finish (not coated). The threading slide of the screw feels solid and the end of the screw hasn't scratched the metal lens in the slightest.\nBut the 12mm f2.0 lens is a special lens in my opinion, is there another 12mm? Is this the widest, non fish-eye lens Zuiko made? I think so. That lens can make a career for a real estate photographer and I love the manual focus clutch (which in itself is pretty rare for Zuiko).\nI'm including a quick cel-phone snap of the lens, this hood and my EM5 Mii... to me personally, it's one of the sexiest camera combinations that I can remember (I immediately thought of the stealth fighter jet when i saw it together at first). I'm going to (hopefully) leave my gear behind to my daughter. And for this case, I want the official genuine lens hood... not an affordable Chinese knock-off.",

I went snorkeling on a 'once in a lifetime' trip - it took four photos (good quality) and when it switched to video, it froze up after 0:28 seconds.  And did not unfreeze until the battery died, which was at the end of the day.  So I guess a plus is that it had really good battery life (it would not hard reset or anything).  The downside is that I only got 28 seconds of video and nothing else.  Personally, I won't trust this brand to anything other than playing in a swimming pool.  Hopefully it was a fluke, but bad enough for me that I don't want to try it again.",

The battery constantly needs to be recharged- it doesn't last very long at all.  The camera freezes up constantly and needs to be reset-- and a lot of the time that doesn't work either!  The screen will go blank and a little green light will just keep flashing.  It also gets hot on the charger--- so I would not trust it to leave it charging over night.  This is our 2nd one-- because the first one, that was a Christmas gift for our son, crapped out after less than a month.  We were able to send it back to the company- at our expense.. and they sent us a new one.  The very same issues.  It is cheaper than a go-pro for sure, but you get what you pay for.  So disappointing because I read reviews on this camera before we purchased it- and the reviews that  I saw were pretty good.  I can only guess that these were reviews by excited people who just opened the package, or had only used it maybe once or twice.  It's very unlikely that I will ever buy another Vivitar camera.",

                "review_body": "Long story short, I lost the charger to my olympus underwater camera while on vacation the day before a rafting trip. Saw this in walmart, it included a helmet mount and a waterproof case, and it was $40, so I said why not.\n\nI tried to put a 64GB card into it, and I got an error message, then I noticed that it only takes 32 GB cards. No biggy, back to walmart and the problem is solved for $8.\n\nI then took a picture of my daughter sitting still reading her kindle in the hotel room, and it was aweful, it was like something you would get from a 15 year old cell phone. Blurry, dull and pixelated. I set the resolution to 12 MP, and it didn't improve at all. I'll attach a 12MP picture for your review.\n\nAnyway, without a remote, I can't image getting any usable photos from this camera. Particularly while moving.\n\nThe video quality is likewise terrible. The aspect ratio is locked at 4:3, and the framerate seems to be less than 30FPS, it's very jerky even if I am just sitting in a hotel room.\n\nThere are very few options in the menu section, so there is little help of improving the quality. I'm not even sure that I want to bring it with me.\n\nLong story short, don't bother with this one, get a better camera or use an old cell phone...",

The warranty and customer service for this product are inadequate, and they don't solve the problems, and won't replace what I think is a defective product. All of my photos came out black. I explained this to customer service, and they kept trying to get me to fix the camera with the reset button. The reset button did not work. The warranty is now expired, and I've never taken a photo with this camera that didn't come out black. I'd rather use a flip phone camera. Just buy something else, and don't take your chances with a defective product that won't be adequately serviced.

Once to try it out and once to remind myself of the poor quality. It doesnt have any kind of internal stabalization so even walking with it mounted to my head is unwatchable because of shakiness. Not to mention it has terrible jello effect when bouncing or moving any thing faster than a walk. Im thank full I didnt spend my money on this camera because its not worth it in my opinion. However, when its not being all bouncy and jello-ee the picture actually looks nice. I got some nice video of me and my family at the park one afternoon. If you have it in its case the mic wont pick anything up but if you have it out and speak loud enough it works just fine. I did notice that the case tens to take in a little moisture when its cold outside. Having only used it twice, i havent tested it underwater in a pool but i submerged it in my sink for a minute and it was fine. I accidentally droped the case (by itself) and the clamp on the side broke. A little superglue fixed it up nicely and it works as it did before. Even tested it in the water again.\n\nAll in all, not really worth it but has some nice moments.",

                "review_body": "i'm not a video guy. the reason I wanted to try this lens is that it was eighty bucks cheaper than the photo version of the 12mm f2.8, seeming to be an identical twin. i was gonna use it for taking photos. well, folks, these two lenses aren't identical!\n\ntwo major differences: 1. the cine model doesn't have a chip in it, your camera won't recognize it. the photo version for Nikon has a chip in it and my cameras (d750 and d5100) do recognize it. 2. on d750 you can set up a custom lens for this in aperture priority mode, but you will have to settle with the camera default 13mm instead of its real 12mm while the camera can see the photo model at 12mm. with the same setup the photo model seems to be much faster.",

The case is really narrow so the inside pocket is unusable for fear of breaking the lcd screen on the camera, yet there is plenty of room top to bottom and on the sides; just not enough to store anything. It is a well made case and it protects my camera in my purse or large camera case with all my other goodies. It is a molded hard case, but it's not hard plastic, so it is flexible and comfortable yet protects well. I've never really found the perfect case. If the dimensions were more specific to your device, it would be nicer.",

The simple black case is well constructed with typical Lowepro quality, has a beltloop and small interior pocket for a memory card or earbuds.  I think it would be fine for traveling with your iPod, but if you're looking for a small camera case, pay close attention to the case dimensions.",

Note it DOES NOT fit the Apple iPhone though as the iPhone is too tall for this case.\n\nThis case is worth the money if your device fits in it.

                "review_body": "This is the perfect case for my flip video.  I wanted a hard protective case (but not a molded plastic one) for when I carry the camera in my purse or other bags.  The size of this one is perfect and it's simple.  There aren't a lot of pockets or extras I don't need so the price stays reasonable.\n\nI found the Lowepro Hipshot 20 for Flip video cameras while I was here today and ordered one.  It's a soft case with a clip on it.  I'm thinking that the Flip inside the Hipshot will still fit nicely into this hard case.  That way, when I want to I can pull it out of it's safe purse \"storage\" and clip it on the outside for quicker access.  The Hipshot gives a choice of black, blue or cherry. It might even end up working well with my Sansa Fuze.  Lovin' it!",

                "review_body": "PROS:\n- Very compact.  It would be a really tight squeeze for a pocket, but fits nicely into a purse without taking up a lot of room.\n- Solid build.  Quality of materials seems to be good.  It feels like a hybrid of a hard case and a soft case.  The outside is hard  with some give, while the inside is a soft material.\n- Decent protection.  The inside has no padding, but the outside material seems to take shock absorption well.\n- Outer material doesn't seem to get scratched/marked easily.\n\nCONS:\n- Very small.  Must be a small pocket camera to fit well.\n- No room for accessories.  While there is a small pocket on the inside, I struggle to fit my camera and a spare battery.  The battery always flies out when I open the case to remove the camera.\n- No straps/carrying handles.\n- Belt loop is not detachable.  You would actually have to feed your belt through the loop sewn onto the side of the case.\n\nI bought this case with a Sony DSC-HX9V.  The camera barely fits.  The first time I tried to zip it up, I thought it didn't fit at all.  It seems to stretch slightly with use.\n\nI like the small, simple design with the leathery feel on the outside, but I wish it had more room for supplies (memory cards, batteries, etc).  It's great if you want to store it in a purse or backpack and just want a shell to protect the camera in a bigger bag, but if you are looking for a case that will hold the camera and your accessories and you don't wear a belt or like cases that attach to a belt, this case is probably not for you.\n\nThis case does not have any straps or handles.  Once you remove the camera, you either have to hold on to the case, or find a place to put the case.  This can be extremely awkward when trying to take pictures if you use both hands to steady your shot.  It is slightly larger than a standard wallet and probably 2-3x as thick.  It doesn't fit into pockets well.",

This would appear to be the main purpose of this case. Just a small case to take your camera around in.\n\nUnfortunately most cameras either don't come with a case or it's just a sleeve to keep dust off of it. This is compact enough to fit the camera, short USB cable, and a few SD cards. And that's about it. There is a main section for the device and a smaller pocket inside for other slim items. It also features a loop on the outside that you can run a belt through. The case itself appears to be well made and durable; although as others have mentioned, there isn't a lot of padding in there.\n\nGranted if there were additional padding, it would add to the bulk. But it wouldn't hurt to have a little more padding. So it's really more like an extra pocket to keep the camera in and give you easy access to the device while traveling. It'll definately help prevent scratches, cushion minor drops, and keep it relatively safe.\n\nIf that's what you're looking for, then I'd consider this item highly recommended.",

She worked around this by having the camera's loop strap hang out of the case.\n\nThe inside pouch is generous enough to fit the usual memory card sizes (such as CompactFlash or SecureDigital). However, you won't be able to store a spare battery in this pouch. In addition, any memory card that you drop in there will take some work to dig out - unlike some other cases, the card storage area is fairly deep but isn't compartmentalized.\n\nAs with any camera case, you really should handle it yourself, to ensure that it not only fits the target camera, but also fits in your storage area. My wife was really thrilled that it was compact enough to fit in her purse, and also didn't add much bulk to the camera itself.\n\nHappy clicking!",

I have the Sony grip installed and it still fits though there is no room to spare for an extra battery.  An extra SD card will fit in the inside pocket, though.  Since I am usually carrying a front pack or small crossbody, I can put extra accessories in there.\n\nI love the double zipper - I have an after-market wrist strap installed on my camera and the double zipper allows the case to fit snugly over the camera without impeding the strap.",

It also has protective fabric on the sides so your camera won't fall out easily while opening and closing the case.\n\nMy one concern is that the interior might not be soft enough.  The interior fabric is somewhat rough and thin compared to other cases I have used.  I tend to worry more than most people and I feel concerned that the interior might end up scratching the LCD screen.\n\nIt's difficult for me to rate this product.  The exterior is great, but the interior is just average.  When I travel, I plan to use a small soft pack for my camera and then put it inside the Volta, which offers a harder shell to protect against drops and bumps.",

                "review_body": "Just what the Doctor ordered. Great little pouch to place my Concealed Carry 22wmr, stack barrel Derringer as well as a few extra 22 Maxi-mags in there. Camera Case, what camera case?  This is a mini handgun case, for my Concealed Carry defense.\nThese cases last about a couple of years, before the plastic covering starts to fray from your belt, but the fabric itself stays well beyond that for another year. Tough little case, and is highly inconspicuous to everyone. Everyone except one Officer got suspicious of my case, as to why was I wearing two cell-phone cases? Although this one was not a cell phone case, or maybe it was. He laughed his butt of, then asked me if I was concealed Carry. I said \"yes\", he laughed and walked away.",

                "review_body": "I bought this to hold a Canon S100.  This holds the camera very well with a lot of room left for SD cards.  The cover material is made from a semi rigid plastic that provides some protection from minor bumps.  The inner lining is made of a soft material that doesn't scratch the camera.  The one downside to the case is that it has a large belt loop.  The belt loop on the back is about 2.75 inches wide, much wider than most belts.  When hooked onto a belt, the camera case tends to sit mostly below the belt line and makes it a bit awkward.  It would have been better if the camera case belt loop was reduced by an inch or so so that the camera case sits in a more balanced position when hooked to the belt.  Overall a very nice camera case for an S100.",

You could get a usb charger cable and extra sd card but not a plug in the wall charger in interior side pouch. Id recommend to someone one looking for a small protective carry case for a small camera. Just be aware it won't carry much else but that can be a plus. Light and attractive, quality seems good",

I did get the zipper to close but the case has no padding inside and it was so tight it bowed over the lens (if dropped flat I'm sure my cam would be damaged). So I went out and shopped the local stores and tried every one I could get my hands on Lowpro, Caselogic, etc. and I did find one that worked perfect for the Canon S95 IMO and it cost half the price too! Its the \"Case Logic TBC302\" and it was $7.00 locally. It is padded and fits the Canon S95 PERFECT! It also has a pocket that holds (2) spare S95 batteries and still room for an extra card, all in a case that appears smaller than the Volta 20. Amazon has it here if you want to check it out:",

It fits my camera perfectly, actually leaving a decent amount of space making it easier to hold an additional battery or SD card if needed. The pocket inside will be perfect for this as well. One reviewer noted that the inside of the case seemed scrathcy and they feared it would scratch the camera...well I don't see this to be a problem. It's not like it's a velvety soft fabric on the inside, but it's not one that will scratch anything as far as I can tell. And the outside of the case is somewhat hard which makes it great if you drop it.\n\nOverall, great little case! I love Lowepro products :).",

I\nbegan Ordering the LowePro Volta-20 Digital Camera Cases.First the Grey\none,then the Black.They Appear to be well Made,with Decent Materials &\nConstruction & Fairly Functional so a Third was in Order.\n\n A little Digging around on the LowePro Website Revealed that there was in Fact\na Third Color Offered in this Particular Case.\"Twilight Blue\".All seemed right\nwith our small Slice of the World of Digital Photography so I quickly began the\nSearch for a \"Twilight Blue\" LowePro Volta-20 Case.\n\n This is were things got STICKY!Did Amazon have it? NO! Did I find it myself on\nany other US Site,(including LowePro)? NO! In fact the only Sites I saw it\nListed on as \"In Stock\" during Searches were Australian Sites.Okay,no problem.I\nlike the Aussies just as much as I like everyone else.So I Contacted one of the\nSites & asked what one would Run in USD + Shipping.\n\n To my Dismay,they informed me that they do not Ship to the US.Having #3\nMatching Cameras,and only two Matching Cases,& my Daughters Birthday soon\napproaching giving up was not an Option.Not to mention I'm not the Quitting\nKind,I decided to get in touch with the Manufacturer LowePro,& ask them\ndirectly.\n\n If the \"Twilight Blue\" was actually available in the U.S.,& were it could be Purchased.\nHere's where this Review TRULY Merits #5Stars,& where in over 16years of doing\nBusiness on the Internet I found myself Impressed by the Promptness,Efficiency\n& Customer Service of a Company for the first time.\n\n Checking my e-Mail I saw one from LowePro literally within a few Minutes.\nThinking it's surely one of those Auto Responses,\"Thank you for contacting customer\nservice,we will get back to you as soon as possible,have a nice day\" kinda\nthing I went ahead and Read it anyway.\n\n To my Surprise it wasn't a Auto Response,but an actual Representative REAL\nLIVE PERSON from the Company responding to the e-Mail I had sent through their\nSite only Moments ago.Even MORE surprising still He had already Tracked Down\nthe EXACT Model and Color (presumably through his companies records of sales)\nthat I was looking for,& e-Mailed me a Link to the Webpage.\n\n Long Story Short I quickly Ordered the Final LowePro Case needed from the\nSecond Party Website,& it's on it's way here as we Speak.\n\n In Closing,if I have to tell you how INCREDIBLY Rare this Scenario is,then you\nhaven't done much Business on the Internet.\n\nThank You LowePro,TOP NOTCH!\n  Chaz",

Despite this small size there's still room for an extra sd card, or other small accessories. Unfortunately you're not going to be able to fit a charger or even a USB cable in this case but I usually leave that stuff at home so this limitation hasn't been an issue for me.\n\nOther people might prefer a softer case with more padding. While it is true that this case doesn't have a ton of padding it is somewhat rigid, providing crush protection that a soft, padded case doesn't seem to provide as much of. To me this case protects against the kind of problems that I expect to have when transporting this camera, such as having heavy books or other items in my backpack crush the camera. I've had this case for over a year now and have been very happy with it.",

I couldn't believe the internal memory only had the capacity for 1 photo..but we still moved on to printing.  This is where we decided that this item is really garbage.  You can't make out the image at all.  I tried different lighting...nothing worked.  The images were kind of scary.  The paper is the same as credit card receipts.  Luckily the return process with Prime has been working out so far.  Looking forward to my refund.  I NEVER return things.  I hate the hassel, but this is worth it.

                "review_body": "UPDATE: I decided to give it another chance and found the settings menu. Changing the settings made a world of a difference. It now prints on par with the other I bought, I think I still like the other better because it is more compact and the plastic feels less cheap than this one. But the other was $35 and I got this for $25 last week (since then the price has gone up to $35 as well). Play with the settings and this works well.\n*********************************************************\nSkip this one and buy a different thermal printing camera. I bought this and another (with a cheesy bear on it...) the other prints darker better quality pictures. They are meant to be lofi, but comparatively this camera sucks. I gave the other 5 stars. This one gets 2.\nSee my photos to compare the light picture of this and the darker more detailed picture from the other. I am going to return this and get another of the other.",

                "review_body": "I love this camera! I got it on sale for around $20 and I wish I had purchased a few! The photo quality isn't amazing but it's way better than I expected. You can change the pixel settings (5, 8, 11mp are the options) but I generally keep it on the lowest. It's fairly easy to learn to use - though I still haven't figured out how to add the decorative frames to photos.\n\nOne thing to note: Sometimes it takes a couple minutes for the camera to warm up enough to print when you first turn it on. In other words, if you turn it on and try to print immediately, you'll get blank paper. Also you can operate it without an SD card but it'll only hold one photo at a time. You can print the same photo multiple times.",

This Sabre fake camera looks realistic and the flashing LED lights are a great addition (though having to replace the AA batteries can become tedious).  In the event that a thief steals this camera I will not be out more than a few bucks and I will have the footage of their theft from my real cameras which are more concealed.\n\nOverall this looks real and is not excessively priced so its easily a 5 star product.",

You must mount it by drilling three holes. But if this were real, the  hidden wire would be going somewhere. Any real burglar or geek would know that if this is mounted in a place that the wire would not be it must be fake. Attach it to the post on the porch? How did the power/signal cord get into the post? The two AAA batteries (NOT included) last 90 days. Better to not use the blinking light anyway. In which case the thing could be made for  $1.99 without the battery, night sensor and LED.\n\nBusinesses especially should avoid fake cameras. If someone is a victim in the vicinity of the camera they could sue because the camera isn't real and they felt protected. A dead REAL camera has plausible deniability, at least.\n\nI'm not impressed.",

You need to pick each one and order separately. This review is for the \"Bullet Camera\" variant that is being sold on Amazon.\n\nI must admit the fake Bullet camera does look real but not exactly like what is pictured on the Amazon product page. I think this a new and improved model (HS-FSCR-B) that has light sensitive \"LDR\" which Senses ambient light and automatically illuminates the IR LEDs and they produce faint Red color glow in the night just like most Day/Night Camera produce. It uses 2 x AAA batteries. See the pictures and you will notice the changes in new design. It also includes mounting hardware. It is crucial to mount this fake camera in such a way that it makes sense as this one does not have any fake cable.\n\nBottom-line: It is a FAKE Bullet Camera. But It might make Burglar think twice but the Burglars are smart these days.\n\nRating with three stars!",

This security camera is smaller than those installed in commercial areas. I would expect it to be a little bigger to make it more visible. It also does not have the shinning \"silver grey metal\" color that I would like to see, which is more close to those security cameras installed in commercial buildings.\n\nPowered by 2 AAA batteries, the built-in ambient light sensor can sense the surrounding light condition. When at dark, it mimics the real security camera and gives out steady red light (like infrared light). During day time, there is no RED light coming out of it.\n\nWell, I would prefer it has one LED blinking light running the whole time, day and night. I just feel the \"LED blinking\" action makes people the unit is really \"working\".\n\nAll in all, I am not too impressed by this fake security camera, specifically, it does not have the flashing LED light.",

In short, it doesn't look quite as realistic as the one in the photo on the website as I write this today. That was a bit of a disappointment. Perhaps they will change to photo to match the actual product.\n\nThis is a cheaply made plastic item from China, but what do you expect from a fake camera? It serves only one purpose -- to tell burglars and criminals to go elsewhere. I suggest mounting it high so people can't touch it or see it too closely. I once knew a burglar, and he said he'd never try to enter a place with security cameras if there was a softer target in the neighborhood. So yes, a fake camera can be a deterrent, and I also have a small placard that says \"NOTICE: For your protection, all activity on these premises is monitored by security cameras.\"\n\nIt's true, I have a real, motion-activated camera inside the house, but all that can do is take video of the person who is robbing my house. It's a good idea to also have something outside that tells the burglar to go elsewhere. If you can afford a full-house alarm and camera system, obviously that's the best way to go.

In order to call accurate corrections for shooters, this eye piece is a must have.  The reticle and glass are crystal clear and are also covered by the Burris forever warranty.  This puts the Burris Signature HD Spotter light-years ahead of competitor scopes in the same price range that dont offer reticle eye pieces and the super clear glass. I highly recommend this eye piece.",

They also dis-continued their 30X ranging eyepiece and none where available anywhere. A posting on Sniper's Hide suggested this Burris eyepiece worked perfectly, so I took a chance and bought one. Sure enough they were right and it works to my observation +,- 2% accuracy for ranging. The quality of the eyepiece is excellent with top resolution & clarity. I think it equals the quality of the factory Razor zoom eyepiece. Warning if you have a Gen.2 Vortex Razor spotter, it will not fit or work. There was a design change.",

However, if you use no battery grip, or use a smaller body (Rebel series or 60D) - it would be great.

There a few other net zipper compartments for the smaller accessories.  My laptop fits fine, it sits low in its area so I room on top to throw in the mouse and probably the power cord if it doesn't fit it the other compartment.  The one thing that the description did not mention is that the side quick access for the camera is reversible.  meaning that there is one on each side of the pack.  you just have to reconfigure the insides so it works for you.  it doenst matter if your a lefty (poor suckers) or a righty, you can make it work either way.

I recently took a train trip from Grand Rapids, Michigan to Portland, Oregon on Amtrack. 2500 miles on a train with a 3 hour layover in Chicago Union Station. I carried this pack, never putting it down for 6 solid days with a 15\" laptop, two large DSLR's, battery chargers,smart phone and \"travling junk\". The compartments are interchangeable inside the main camera compartment and easily changed around for the needs of the kind of lenses you want to carry etc. The velcro could be just a tick more friendly but it got the job done. I easily carried two DSLR's with lenses and an extra telephoto lens. I read a review the laptop compartment was \"tight\" so two days before the trip I stuffed the laptop compartment with photo albums to stretch it out and it worked like a charm. If I had it to do over again, I would have stretched it for a week. The laptop made it safe and sound and so did the cameras. The pack is a little heavier than I thought it would be but you need more than a feather to protect this kind of equipment. It came quickly and I'm very happy with it.

It has space for everything you might need, and I'm big on bringing extra stuff just in case, with this bag, I can fit them all. I had my Canon t3i, My Canon hand camera (dont remember the name), Panasonic lumix LX5, Tablet, Rode mic, flood light, batteries, Tascam DR40, extra cords and batterys, plus I was able to tie a shoulder rig on the outside.. Its basically like carrying a mobile suitcase. This bag was comfortable, and straps helps to keep it on.\n\nI fell in love with this bag, but 20 mins into using it, some of the mesh on one of the pouches already started to give out (PS: I started to give this bag 4 stars,but I figure it should last at least 1 day before falling apart). The price of this bag was DEFINITELY withing reach compared to the rest. I think this is a great bag for people who tend to carry a lot of items.\n\nPros: Big, space for everything, comfortable, Big, secure, lots of compartments for your stuff, and big. Has space for Camera, tons of equipment, cords, and specialized laptop/tablet space. THE PRICE MAKES THIS A WINNER!\n\nCon: Its big (which can be a problem for some), mesh was coming apart day 1 for me, so I suspect after a year I might need to find a new one. No quick easy access.

                "review_body": "I've had this backpack for 3 days. It is a very well designed backpack with plenty of compartment space to store all of your necessary items for photography. I bought this backpack specifically for my one-day trip to Sequoia National Park. Although I was driving the majority of the time, I would take my backpack with me along the small trails to see the sites. Halfway through my trip I noticed that the shoulder strap on the right side has already started to tear away from the body of the bag.\n\nOriginally I packed the following items in the bag to begin my trip:\n\nMac Book Pro 13.3 inch laptop (not carried to Sequoia)\nPhone, wallet, keys, and camera cleaning kit\n300mm Sigma lens\nPentax k-30 camera with 55mm lens (mostly in hand, not in bag)\n2 very small point and shoot cameras\nTripod strapped to the back\n\nWith everything inside and strapped on to the bag, I would say the the bag weights a good 20-25 lbs, however it was constructed to hold that amount of stuff.\n\nAlthough I think that this bag is a wonderful item for any photographer on the go, I am quite disappointed that the strap was not very well constructed. Now I must Frankenstein my shoulder strap so that I can continue using and abusing it. I might as well do it to both straps to ensure security from any future tears.",

                "review_body": "When looking through the reviews for this product, I was worried that it would not be able to hold my Tamron 70-300mm, as other bags I was looking at could hold it at a tight squeeze. Now that I have the bag, it is the least of my worries - the bag can hold the lens standing upright (when bag is flat on its back)! Putting on the lens with the hood attached on my D5100, there is no trouble putting it in the body compartment either, in fact it still has a good amount of space after the lens for another compartment.\n\nThe bag (main compartment) can hold my D5100, Tamron 70-300mm, Tokina 100mm f/2.8 and a kit lens 18-55 with only half the space filled up. It would be able to hold another 3 lenses well! I appreciate the small zips here and there to put really small things like cleaning cloth, remote control and extra lcd protectors.\n\nPros: Good space for photographers with lots of equipment. I've put in my 13'' laptop in it and it fits well too. The compartments can be adjusted easily and thus my equipment feels quite secure. The top space is really big, enough to put in small notebooks, binoculars and other bulky items.\n\nCons: Too much space for photographers like me with just 3 lenses - I end up putting my lens hoods in the other empty compartments. This results in the bag being too unnecessarily bulky, and the compartments aren't sealed, so small items do travel around the bag when carried. The straps are comfortable and thick, but that causes some restrictions when sliding it around to retrieve equipment.",

After less than six months of use (received this as a gift from my wife for Xmas), the stitching on shoulder straps (particularly the right one) has been ripped from top of the bag and are hanging on for dear life by but a few threads - rendering it useless with my more than $3k worth of gear.\n\nI will admit, I shoot and use my equipment quite regularly, removing the backpack frequently to grab gear as necessary. And, I pack my bags full, using every compartment - which one would think the backpack was designed to withstand.\n\nAgain, for moderate users who don't plan on filling the bag with gear (and thus weighing it down) - it may be sufficient but why bother? If you're not going to fill the bag with gear, then bring along a smaller, lighter backpack.\n\nAgain, while the bag was fantastic when first purchased, it has failed miserably from a quality of construction standpoint. Take my advice, pass on this one.",

Being able to change from a shoulder-slung to a cross-slung to a backpack is also great :) The top compartment holds a surprising amount of stuff as well.\n\nTotal stuff in the bag currently:\nCanon T3i + 18-55 kit lens + Hood\nCanon 55-250mm Lens + Hood\nCanon 50mm 1.8 Lens + Hood\nMacro Extenders\nRing Light + battery pack + DC adapter (cheap macro stuff)\nPolarizing filter/UV filter\n2 Portable HDDs\nAA Battery Charger\nPhone Charger Cables + Wall adapters\nLaptop Charger cables\n14.6\" IBM Laptop\n\nSo, it does fit a significant amount of stuff.

                "review_body": "The Good: This item is cheap. Backpack has a lot of storage. *THIS BACKPACK IS VERY COMFORTABLE to wear*. All straps are easy to pull(for loosening and tightening. Backpack is a very comfortable size.\n\nThe Bad: This is important to read: there are NOT enough dividers in this backpack to perfectly layout your setup. I was so very disappointed in this, because ease of organizing your gear is CRUCIAL! This backpack has so much storage space, but with the difficulty of organizing, you can't use all of it! Also, the velcro that lines the walls to customize your layout is not all over the interior perimeter, which makes it very difficult to place a wall exactly where you cant it. I combined all of the dividers from my previous Amazon pack with this one, and still did not have enough to make my layout perfect. Also, the interior does seem a little thin on the padding. I'm not so sure this backpack can effectively keep your gear cushioned, but we should never be throwing our backpacks to the ground anyways I guess.\n\nThe Verdict: This is a great product. Please don't let the huge wall of text in,\"The Bad\" get me wrong. There is a lot to love here. If you are planning on upgrading from an Amazon Basics bag for more comfort and capacity, THIS IS A GREAT LOW COST CHOICE! With the divider trouble though, you're going to have to do some work (and using old dividers) to get your setup right. I really hope Vivitar is kicking themselves in the pants for skimping on the dividers.",

                "review_body": "I'm hoping this review will dissuade anyone considering purchasing this bag. I purchased this bag Brand New for a vacation I had to New York, and immediately began regretting it. I have provided pictures of all the issues. Firstly, this bag does NOT fit a 17\" laptop, my 17\" portable display barely fits in this bag and that has no bezels whatsoever. So unless your 17\" laptop has no bezels and hinges right at the bottom of the display, this bag will not fit your laptop. Second, the bottom of the shoulder straps are mounted on a swiveling clip, so as you slide this bag on and off to access your camera, the straps will rotate on this clip and eventually cause the very thin and soft nylon strap to pinch on the adjustment clip. This doesn't sound like a big issue, but once the strap gets pinched, the adjustment clip just slips and you will need to readjust the your straps every 15 minutes. Getting the strap unpinched and back straight is a huge pain and something that should have NEVER been an issue if they hadn't decided to reinvent this part of a backpack. This slip caused me to injure one of my shoulders after 2 weeks in NY, I should have tossed this bag earlier. Third, the upper compartment zipper material is very thin, so after 20-30 uses, the metal zipper began catching on the fabric portion of the zipper and the zipper would not close. I have never had this happen in my 30+ years of life. Fourth, the belt clip on this backpack is hidden inside the luggage handle slot on the rear of the bag, but is not held in place with anything. Expect this belt strap to just randomly drop repeatedly, you'll just need to tuck it back in place, without any means of keeping it there. Fourth, I was using this bag with a Canon R5, 20-70mm f/2 L & a Sigma 14mm f/1.8 and the dividers are only held in place with small straps of velcro so my lenses were clashing into each other continuously. Seriously, don't waste your money, time or body on this bag.",

I keep all of my gear (lenses, various cables, cloths) in this pack and it doesn't feel heavy after several miles.  I currently carry my kit and \"nifty fifty\" lenses and feel I could easily include a longer lense in this pack once I'm able to upgrade.  I also purchased the Amazon full sized tripod (not travel sized) and it fits well in the tripod strap on the back.  I have to make sure to tighten it really well otherwise there is some bounce and noise, but otherwise it's minimal.  The side pockets a nice feature, especially when the tripod is still on the pack as it blocks the front compartment access panel.  The top access panel is large enough left to right to include a 32oz Rubbermaid leakproof water bottle for your treks and is seperate from the rest of the pack so you don't have to worry about rummaging around for personal items. This backpack has plenty of little mesh pockets inside the flaps with zipper covers as an added touch to keep them from scratching your gear.  I haven't tested the sling pack aspect yet, but like that it has that flexiblity.  This pack doesn't fit my 16\" widescreen laptop, but easily would fit my corporate work laptop.  My netbook fits with plenty of room for the power charger to be included within the sleeve if I wanted.  Overall, I love this pack.",

                "review_body": "When I received the bag I was actually surprised at its size.. It is a fairly medium to large sized pack(almost school book bag sized..not as wide)..I'm 5'11\" and it's not huge, but not too small and female looking(on a man).\nThe reviews discussing the interior materials and Velcro quality are VERY true as far as plan your positioning and use your fingers to separate the velcro( so to relieve the pressure of tearing)... Mine did tear a bit and the nylon is tough to repair.. But it is what it is... I sewed it up as best I could, put it where it's gonna stay, you aren't gonna see it! and on with life! Exterior quality seems to be fine.. I know other reviews mention zipper issues.. I have not had any as of yet! Used a few times in and out-doors(cold weather). Will keep you posted as to in the future.\nAs for capacity... It will hold some gear! If you have 8 lenses and diffuser screens and multiple slave flashes a camcorder, 6 p.&s cameras, etc.. NOT what your lookin for!! I have my T3i w/ 18-55mm attached, 75-300mm( can also fit mounted), filters, batteries, chargers, various cords, hoods...and have room for a point & shoot and my handycam in the bottom...top enough space for a lunch or rain poncho and some trinkets( your not going out for a 3 day camp with just this!!). For a day at the park, or at a venue ..Perfect..maybe a tad bulky but..all-in-all..\nCONCLUSION: For $50...it gives you the size, ability, and style of the KATA, Tamrac,etc at a 1/3 of the cost.. If your a professional(getting paid for your shots, and traveling 340 days for it)..you don't need or wouldn't be looking at this bag!!.. If your going a vacations, and taking the family to the theme park or day hikes/bikes then, this is a GOOD BUY!!! Yes you may have to fix an issue or two, you will probably customize it, and you will be able to determine if it is comfortable as a sling or not..for me.. Long hours of wear(backpack mode), an hour or two(sling is fine) yes, the padding is a bit funky for sling but I found that I can adjust it so it doesn't rub my neck..look as I said.. It's a backpack with options..which is why we are all looking at it!! And like me this is the 100th review you have read and have narrowed down your 2 or 3 choices and makers... I chose this one and I am satisfied completely with cost and above cost quality..should last for a while and do what I need it to! Hope this helps all those like me who obsess over research, products and manufacturers, etc...before buying.. But then again \"to each his own..\"",

                "review_body": "Update: It has now been over 6 years since I bought this backpack! I'm finally ready to buy a new bag, but this thing held up wonderfully. I'd have never expected a $50 camera bag to last this long with nearly daily use. Let me tell you what broke, and why I'm looking at other options, but before I do I should clarify that this is still a five-star product due to how long it lasted.\n\nFailure points:\nThe fabric dividers have started coming apart. The stitching holding them together simply couldn't take any more abuse. I've dealt with this for a few months, but the final straw was the zipper breaking on one of the side access flaps.\n\nDesign flaws:\n1. The straps have WAY too much length to them, and not enough options to retain excess material, meaning my bag has always been covered in hanging strap excess. You could tape things up, but that would only be putting a band-aid on the problem.\n2. The divider pads are too soft, and they give way very easily. Often my equipment would end up jumbled, at least after the first few years of use.\n3. The shape of the top zipper enclosure is just silly. The way that it flairs out makes it floppy and annoying to deal with one-handed.\n4. The top compartment has inadequate pockets for keeping items organized. It just wound up as a jumbled mess in the end.\n5. Some of the outside (side) pockets are uselessly small\n6. The tripod holding system is junk. I wouldn't keep a $10 monopod on there.\n\nWith all that said, it has survived to this day. If I can't find something else with the convinient quick-access side and similar size, I'll probably just buy another one of these.\n\nOriginal Review:\nI've had the Vivitar for over three years now.  I am a professional photographer (or at least, people pay me to take pictures and it is my only revenue stream) and this bag goes to every shoot.  I've only now started to see some wear and breakdown, which is a damn long service life for such an inexpensive bag.\n\nAbout the bag:\nI can carry a 5D MK3 (with or without grip) along with my flash, a 70-200 L and two normal sized lenses (a 20mm and a 17-40).  I also carry 6 batteries, extra memory cards, a laser tape measure and lots of odds and ends.  I can even stick a good sized tablet or small laptop in the provided pouch.\n\nThe big selling point for me with this bag is how you can sling it sideways on your front and pull your camera right out, ready to shoot.  The top access works great when you use it like a normal bag and set it on a table to switch lenses.\n\nPros:\n+Strong handles and straps.  They're all still in place and working\n+Comes with a rain cover that doesn't cover the straps, so you can keep on trekking\n+Plenty of little pockets and spaces for various things, including zipper closed netting pouches in the top segment\n+Tough enough for regular use.  I wouldn't take it on lots and lots of outdoor shoots, but if you shoot indoors, it stands the test of time\n+Small and compact enough to not look like a paratrooper when you're walking around\n+Good strong zippers, no problems there! All the zipper pulls are still intact too\n+Comfortable\n\nCons:\n-The dividers are flimsy, as with all other camera bags I've used.  They still work though\n-The monopod/tripod holder is only good for small, light units.  It won't carry anything I own.  The strap for it also has little resistance, allowing it to come lose.\n-Because there are three sides you can open, sometimes I would forget and leave one open, though somehow none of my gear has fallen out yet.  I know this just sounds like me being an idiot, but if you do this work day in and day out, you're bound to forget some time.\n\nSummery:\nIf you need a relatively cheap bag that doesn't carry a whole bunch of lenses and you don't shoot professionally outdoors, this bag will probably work for you.  If you are a hobbyist of any kind, this thing might last you a decade.",

The 118 is exactly the same length as the 037 Short Stud (26mm) and thus allows a ball head to sit flash against the Super Clamp.\n\nThe 118 is basically a reversible stud and has a 3/8\" screw for tripod heads and a 1/4\" one flip side for cold shoes and other accessories. Brass is a lot softer than steel and will break if you over-torque. So snug it up but don't muscle it and it will last a very long time.\n\nI can never own too many of these little adapters and they've saved me many times when building a rig to hang an extra light, reflector or camera.",

Others have weird sleeves or odd sizes which make them awkward to use, and very few seem to allow you to use a tripod in both horizontal and vertical orientation. This design and construction is great, yet could probably cost about $20 less. I would say it is overpriced, but I did buy it and this is photography, so I'll let you be the judge. I was planning a trip into the Canadian back country which is known for rain, and I didn't want to get ll the way out there and not have a properly functioning rain cover.

These legs spreads far apart so the floor spreaders kept the legs in a \"smaller spread\" which increases overall height.  My 755 legs having a center column, so the floor spreader gets in the way to collapse the tripod in the \"put away\" position\".  So I would need to take the spreader off at the end of the shoot.  But I think it is best to remove the spreader anyways so the \"stretched position\" rubber bands does not weaken.\n\nCons: When moving while shooting, collapsing the legs to move and re-opening the legs, sometimes you need to kick a leg or two to fully open as the spreader foot is not in it's fully rest position.  This is when the spreader is in its smallest diameter position.  I have not used the fully wide diameter position.\nWorking with it on carpet and grass is another thing.  Carpet, no problem, but on grass, the tripod floats.  I removed the spreader and the tripod was much more stable.\n\nFor the price, a good buy.",

I like the fact that there is a separate little door to access the battery/SD card compartment so that you don't have to remove the case to swap them out.\nHowever, I am pretty sure it's not genuine leather. It's a nice PU leather-look though.\nWhile I would have liked it to be actual leather (since that is how it is described), I am still happy with it.",

                "review_body": "The review of this lens actually gave me very mixed emotions. You probably just said emotions? Yes, and I will explain.\n\nFirst off here's some info:\nMy Experience Level: Professional (Successful Photography Business, 30+ Weddings, Thousands of Portraits)\nCamera Body: Canon EOS R + EF adapter (needed)\n\nThe 1 star for auto focus and image stabilization is due to the lens not having these features. In order for the Camera body to take photos you need to actually go into custom settings and tell the camera \"Release Shutter without a Lens attached\". Yes, unless it's a Canon lens the body will not even acknowledge it's existence. The lens also does not have mechanical image stabilization. If your camera body does not have digital stabilization I suggest shooting in 3 photo bursts to help with he potential shake/stutter when hand holding.\n\nWith that said, lets talk about the lens itself. First of all it looks, feels and functions just as good as Canon's prime lenses. It's heavy, well made and actually looks really cool. The lenses dials have very satisfying click/tap feedback as you change the settings and the focus ring is very very smooth! I was blown away! The biggest con is you must manual focus the lens using the ring. Now, I was terrified at this. I have always auto focused, rarely using the viewfinder to take photos. My screen is always open, max brightness and I tend to always shoot this way. One huge find is that I discovered Canon's manual focus feature to highlight areas that are in sharp focus STILL functions with this lens (picture included with review). That may be a game changer for some, because it actually eliminates a lot of the uncertainty.\n\nWith all that said I can now bring up the mixed emotions. First off, the lens takes absolutely stunning photos. I can't really stress how beautiful the bokeh actually is. I knew for a very long time if I wanted the creamiest, smoothest bokeh a (1.2 or 1.4) 85mm was the excalibur for portraits. The issue is Canon's version of these lenses are literally between $2300 and $2800 dollars. So, basically you're paying $2000+ more dollars for auto focus/stabilization and lens features syncing up with Canon's faster point/shoot system. Nothing against Canon, because I know they price their professional lenses with market markup taking into consideration the \"returns\" the lens will give. However, in my case and for many after the pandemic $2700 is just way too much money for me right now. I am so happy with the lens, and plan on putting it to great use this year!",

This represents just another example of Olympus (and a few other name brand optics makers)  predatory behavior with their customer base.  Shame on them for this approach to their loyal customers.",

So it's worth paying for this lens hood if you've already paid for the 9-18mm lens which isn't a cheap lens.\n\nHowever, one can't help but point out the cheapness of Olympus not including the lens hood with such an expensive lens. This is just a piece of plastic that probably costs only a few cents each to manufacture once the mold is already designed.",

So, when I pack it up into the lens pouch or camera pouch, I have to fiddle with it or it will go in sidewise. That means it has to be packed in the deployed position. Sloppy design work, Olympus.

Come on Olympus, do the right thing for your customers!\n\nA minor drawback of this hood is it won't attach to the lens when reversed, as can be conveniently done for storage purposes with other similar hoods on bayonet mounts.  The 9-18mm lens it fits is so compact, easing storage with the hood even a small amount might make sense.\n\nOne thing this hood has that I don't see on the much less expensive knockoffs is an optically dampening coating on the inner portion of the plastic hood (a dark matte type surface to reduce reflective glare.)  That's what you get for the higher price, for what it's worth.",

When I put it on the lens it remains slightly tilted and does not fit quite level, as one would expect from such a relatively expensive item from the same, original manufacturer of the lens. Seems to work well in spite of this though.\n\nUPDATE: just noticed the \"clicking\" part in other reviews, and installed the hood properly. Now it fits perfectly, I just hadn't noticed that detail earlier and was afraid of forcing this plastic piece onto the lens and damaging it, my mistake! No more complaints!",

Get the best of both.  4 stars only because imho the hood is overpriced.\n\nBit of a niggle with Oly.  Unlike the Panasonic Lumix mu43 lens purchased, Oly does not include a hood or lens bag.  Expensive after purchase options that should be included in these +$500 lens.  There is a non OME very similar looking hood made in China (probably from the same plant) that sells for ~$15usd.  Not wanting to risk another oops I spent the extra few dollars here at Amazon.  Lucky day, it was a \"Gold Box\" special item.",

Furthermore, the hood fits over a filter, instead of being screwed into it. Thus it does not create vignetting when used together with a filter. (I advise using only very slim filters as this is such an ultra-wide lens.)\n\nIt should, however, have been included free with the lens, plus a lens case... Available lens \"pouches\" are too big, and don't offer much protection. Come on, Olympus--you used to include lens hoods and sturdy lens cases for OM lenses!  Especially for a $600 lens...",

The failure happened with the silver colored screw mount. It's only held in inside of the black metal casing by three screws. They got loose and my lens popped out with the screw mount still attached to it.\n\nWould only recommend this adapter for smaller lenses and I would still take a look for another alternative. Something preferably all one piece.",

At first I was very disappointed, since when screwed all the way on to the adapter, the f-stop adjustment tab was on the bottom of the lens. This was not a very convenient place for that to be! Then I  noticed there are three small screws on the side of the adapter. An easy fix to the problem was to remove the screws and rotate the two parts of the adapter to a new position and re-tighten the screws. Now the f-stop adapter is located where it should be - on top of the lens. It took all of 5 minutes to fix, so I still give it 5-stars.",

These later lenses have a tab in the mount that communicated the aperture to the setting to film camera bodies, and this tab contacts the inside of the adapter before the lens is fully screwed in. In fact, trying to install the adapter scraped some of the black paint from the tab.\n\nHowever, it does work with the older Super Takumar lenses, as these lack the aperture tab.\n\nTo make the design compatible, the adapter must be modified to remove the flange that presses in the diaphragm pin. This is no problem as long as one switches the lens to \"man\".\n\nProblems are likely with any lens that has an enhanced variation of the M42 base. Other than that, it's a well made adapter.",

The adapter includes a seat on the inside that pushes the pin in so that the diaphragm is always closed to your set shooting aperture.  The camera sets the correct exposure on using aperture preferred and following additional Sony instructions.  You cannot use the \"Manual/Auto\" lever on the lens to open the diaphragm using this adapter.  Also, you cannot use preset Zeiss Jena lenses that have a metal rim extending beyond the threaded part of the lens mount because they clash with the seat in the Fotodiox M42 to Sony E adapter.\n\nIf you wish to use the Manual/Auto lever to open the diaphragm on your M42 lenses, you may do so by getting the Fotodiox Pentax K-mount to Sony E adapter and adding a Pentax M42 to K  adapter.  Then you may focus with the lens wide open and then move the Manual/Auto lever to close the lens to shooting aperture.\n\nSimilarly, if you wish to shoot with older (1950's) preset Zeiss Jena lenses, use a Fotodiox Pentax K-mount to Sony E adapter and a Pentax M42 to K mount adapter ring, and these lenses will fit perfectly.\n\nNote added:  Upon seeing comments on reflections from the rear of the front ring, I mitigated this problem by using a black Sharpie pen on the back of the chrome ring.  If you wish, you could remove the chrome ring and use flat black primer paint.  Finally, I have had no trouble using this adapter with nine different SMC and Super Multi-Coated Pentax lenses.",

It is simply a tube of the correct length to allow for the use of Pentax screw mount lenses (M42 type lenses) on a Sony NEX e-mount camera.  It clicks into place on the camera body smoothly and snugly.  Then the M42 lenses screw into the adapter equally smoothly.  However, you should check each time you shoot to make sure the lens is snug.  It tends to loosen in use.  This is especially true of long lenses.  The problem is that the long lenses are heavy and you will, most likely, find yourself handling and carrying the camera by the lens if it is long (e.g. 135mm or 200mm etc.) to keep the weight off of the camera body lens flange.  Additionally, you may find the older lenses are a bit stiff to focus if they have been out of use for a while (very likely!).  As you focus, you may accidentally find yourself unscrewing the lens.",

I say that, because I have been using medium format cameras since 1941 and the results I am getting from my Sony surpass the shots out of my Rolleis, Hasselblad and Mamiya medium format equipment. Not only is the shadow detail greater, but the smoothness in even tones, like the sky, exceed that taken with film cameras. If Fotodiox maintain their present high standards of quality control at their reasonable price points, they will dominate the market. I know something about marketing. I was the Ad Mgr for a Fortune 500 company when I was 28. Of course, I've been retired now for some 30 years. Keep up the good work!",

The combination works well and it is certainly fun to play with the old lenses again, using the 5n's excellent MF capabilities and the wonderful bokeh and shallow DOF inherent in the lens's design. I will probably get the equivalent Canon FD adapter as well.

They complained within a month that they the phones were telling them there was a problem with the cards.  We reseated the cards and finally got them to be recognized again by the phones.  Then in about another month same issue on both phones again.  This time one card failed completely, contacted customer service and currently awaiting the shipment of a replacement card, but the second phone is having more trouble too.  They work well when working but only three months into this a not a good track record.",

                "review_body": "Got this microSD card out of curiosity when it was on sale.  The card is advertised as a Class 10/U3 card, so it should maintain at least 10MB/s when writing data.  Running Crystal Disk Mark shows reasonably good numbers for sequential reads/writes which compare somewhat favorably to a 4-year-old 64GB Samsung Pro microSD card I had sitting around.\n\nHowever, trying to transfer a large 3.5GB data file to my Strontium Nitro A1 revealed a problem.  The card appears to provide advertised write speeds with relatively small files, but continuously writing to the card shows that write speeds can drop to 1MB/s or even less, as I witnessed in my tests.  This can present a problem if you bought this card thinking that you can use it to capture long running videos.  Running the same test against my old Samsung card shows that it does not suffer from the same issue.\n\nBottom line: Do not buy if you must have a microSD card that can maintain class 10/U1/U3 speeds at all times.  It should be an OK card if your typical usage involves mostly reads or if your writes are limited in size and duration.  The card appears to stall after only a few seconds of writing.",

                "review_body": "I was looking for a high-end 16GB micro SD card to use as the hard drive in my Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi is an extremely tiny computer that measures ~about 5\"x3\"x2\". These small but powerful computers are used for things like controlling  automated Christmas light displays; I use mine for the  graphic intensive application called Kodi. This micro SD card was purchased in late June, 2019. The Raspberry Pi does not have a traditional hard drive, they're very Compact and use a Micro SD card to function as the hard drive. So I was looking for a very high-end card of relatively small size today, as it's a critical repository for the operating system. I've had this for a few months now and I'm noticing more and more fatal errors reading and writing to the drive. I pulled the micro SD card and deep formatted it multiple times trying to resolve the air. I only paid about $6 for this but I was willing to spend more to get a very stable reliable Drive. This is not the drive. Although relatively small by today's standards, it probably would work fine for holding images and video and stuff, but again 16GB they pretty much put in a box of Cheerios today. Storage has gotten phenomenally cheap. So I'm searching for a better flash drive, typically Samsung drives have been Rock Solid I may go that direction.\n\nActually, this should be under warranty. If any providers ever read reviews; I have a failed card guys. Help me out.",

He typically plays in 2-3 games a day of each Saturday and Sunday in season, and this card can hold  4-6 full two hour long game videos for each of two weekends before I need to do a data dump and start again the next weekend.  Never a failure, always works first time and never any issues with bad sectors and lost data even after using it for almost a full year so far.

                "review_body": "I purchased this rifle scope cover for my Redfield 2x7x33 scope. Main purpose was to protect the scope while it is in the safe. Do not hunt, so it really doesn't get outside often. I found the cover to be durable. Fit well over my 11.1\" scope. The attaching lanyard is a nice feature, especially for those who hunt or carry outdoors. So many scope covers are very expensive. This cover is very reasonable in price and does the job of protecting my scope well. Happy with this purchase.",

It is simply a wide strip of neoprene with tapered ends that fasten with a magnet. My binoculars, which are listed among the ones stated on the packaging for which this \"case\" is suited, are apparently a bit too long for the magnetic closure to work reliably.\nThe \"case\" is intended to remain attached to the bins while using them.

Has a convenient pull tab on one end (towards you) and a elastic piece with snaps to wrap around barrel and forearm. With a sling attached, one does not have to worry about losing the scope armor, you just pull tab and let it flop to the side. Innovative and well priced, protects one of the most important components of your firearm.",

                "review_body": "I love using my Zeiss Touit 12mm on my Fuji X-E2, and I'm often shooting outdoors in daylight.  While the camera produces images with a great deal of dynamic range, especially at lower ISOs and the lens allows such lower ISOs, I'm always looking for ways to produce better images.  Using a graduated ND filter allows me to offset the inherent brightness of the sky and focus exposure on the rest of the scene.  It doesn't give me more dynamic range per se, rather it allows me to use what I have where I want to use it.  This is the real benefit of this (and other graduated ND filters), which cannot be replicated in post processing (you can darken the sky, but that's not the entirely point).\n\nThis particular filter works well in this regard.  It stays clean, rotates smoothly but not too easily, and it's easy to align with my lens (typically in landscape rather than portrait orientation).  It's also clear and free of any color cast (thus the neutral in ND) and readily holds on to a lens cap.  It's not perfect, as I'd prefer a slightly thinner profile (while still holding on to a normal lens cap), a black color, and a clearer indication of orientation.  Those faults don't impact my images, so I'm rather forgiving.\n\nPros:\nOne of the remaining filters that cannot be replicated in post processing (this does far more than darkening skies)\nClear and free of color cast\nStays clean and smudge free\nRotates smoothly but stays in place\n\nCons:\nPricey (when over $100, but a better deal when $80 or so)\nCould be thinner (I didn't see vignetting on my 12mm lens) and grey color an odd decision\n\nI'd prefer the B+W XS-Pro to this, but I got this for quite a bit less ($75), but there's a lot to love here.",

                "review_body": "In my opinion Tiffen HTs and B+W F-Pros (the 702M) are the best grads out there, for those of us who don't have time to fiddle with (and keep a grip on) rectangular filters. Most of my filters are Hoyas, but their grad is not great quality with some color cast, and it's also a 1 to 3 stop which is weird, so I'll strictly compare those first two.\nThe disadvantage of this Tiffen is that it uses a somewhat outdated version of coatings that picks up oils and whatnot, and fights a bit when you try to clean it. It does adequately block reflections, the glass quality is excellent, and it has no visible color cast.\nThe B+W grad has significantly better multicoating but two disadvantages. First, it has a slight reddish color cast in the ND just like most of B+W's constant ND filters. This would be mildly annoying, but not a dealbreaker with just two stops. Second, B+W's mount is 7mm thick, while Tiffen's is 6mm.\nThe gradient is about the same hardness on both, and neither noticeably degrades sharpness.\nIf you know mechanical vignetting can occur with a reasonable stack of filters on your lens, get this Tiffen. If that isn't an issue, get whichever you can find cheaper. If you're on a tight budget or don't foresee using a grad often in x filter size, get Tiffen's cheaper uncoated grad, which is oddly the only good-quality Tiffen I've ever tried besides the HTs.",

I am a professional photographer and have owned dozens of filters over the years but since the advent of digital cameras and photoshop, I have tossed out every filter except the Grad ND and a polarizer.  The grad filter proves invaluable for all kinds of subjects where the sky is way brighter than the rest of the scene.  I use it for family portraiture all the time adnd every pro should use one of these to control exposure accross the scene.  That being said, I have two gripes:  First, there are no points on the edges to mark the center of the gradient, and once it's screwed onto the camera lens, its hard to tell where the gradient begins or ends.  Consequently, I have marked the center-line edges with a dab of white-out for quick reference in the field.  Second, the gradient seems to end abrublty half-way through the filter.  It should be a gradual gradient from dark to light with no definite line down the center.  Though this may be valuable for some subjects, I prefer a \"true\" gradient with a smoother \"fall-off\" or transition.",

Where the B+W MRC coated filter wipes clear with one swipe of a microfiber rag. Also, I noticed the filter left horizontal lines in the shadow areas of an image which were very visible upon even slightly boosting the shadows in post processing. The case is not great either as it left a residue on the filter, causing me to have to re clean it every time I took it out of the case. The hard shell cases from B+W are much better.

                "review_body": "This is my favorite Ball-Head except for the older model Slik (DQ-280) that does not require a clip to unlock the arm. I use this for real-estate photography where getting the angles correct in your images is critical. What sets this Ball-Head apart from other Ball Heads on the market including much more expensive ones, is the large double-bubbles on the side of the head that help in keeping your camera leveled, perfect for those angles ! Not only that, it is pretty compact and light, but not too small where you start pinching your fingers. It does not hold a lot of weight(11 lbs), but for my real-estate camera and lens system that is plenty. I have larger and bulkier heads for my long lenses.",

                "review_body": "I've had this ball head camera mount for over two years.  I originally bought it with a Slik carbon fiber tripod.  I have no complaints and really like the action, the built-in levels and the thin camera mount.\n\nI recently purchased another for my monopod since I do tend to switch back and forth on occasion.  Honestly, you can't tell the difference between the 2+ year old and the new one.\n\nThis head is relatively small and light yet performs very smoothly.  I've never had any issues with creep even with my Canon D40 and a medium-long telephoto.\n\nFor those that live in cooler climes; I have used this head in -10 degree weather with no issues.  Couldn't be happier.",

I thought that for the price and weight, the handle assembly would be more sturdy, would've liked to see the handle at least foam wrapped, but better still an aluminum assembly. I'm giving this softbox a 2 star for it's quality, but omitting the other three stars because: (1) The shoe mount broke under the weight of my flash on its first use. The metal screw that holds the shoe in place, sheared off. Luckily I was indoors on carpet, flash is ok. I've already purchased separate metal cold/hot shoe sets and it's fixed that issue, but it shouldn't break 5 minutes into using a new item. (2) The handle is poor quality and has a design flaw: doesn't hold the softbox upright when mounted on a light stand. Maybe on its own, but not with a Canon 580EX, Yongnuo  (3) The stems of the softbox continually detach from their holders.",

Having been able to compare the two you can tell there's differences in build quality with the Fotodiox being a little bit more flimsier, and with a heavier plastic build.  But if you want something that functions, and works well I think you will be very impressed with this guy.\n\nUsed it for several photoshoots already including a 3 day Indian/American wedding and the results from the softbox are excellent.  The big win factor for the unit is the portability and ease of setup and break down.  I was up and ready in sub 2 minutes setup and break down, and that's a MAJOR plus as a wedding photographer.  This softbox provided excellent lighting for Macro Photography, Portraiture, and more.  I had a 600ex-RT as the light source and had zero issues using both a wired and wireless solution for this device.\n\nFor those concerned about the plastic build it can be an issue over time, plastic normally is.  If you don't baby your equipment and expect 3-5 years from it I suggest going for a rapid box.  But if you want good quality lighting, don't baby your equipment, I'm pretty confident with the build quality from this unit you can get a year of shooting with it without worries.  For only $70, the price of this thing can deliver some pretty damn awesome results making it worth the year.",

I have casted new handle from aluminum and now it will last me forever.\n\nIf you are on budget  and you mostly shoot portraits or fashion on location or in run and gun situations than it is no brainer. Get one even if you get more expensive gear later.  you will find yourself using this one quite often.\nYou can see my photos taken with this light modifier as main light. In single light or two light setups seconds light is bare flash as a kicker light. This octabox gives nice catches in the eyes and smooth shadows on face. Love this thing using it 85% of the time\nUPDATE:\ntHIS THING IS RAD  i do not know why but this thing is awsome because of  its so light and compact  i end up using it  almost every where and every time.  i like this size  for my dramatic portraits it gives me right type of shadows.  this is good to use in tight spaces  it is good in public spaces  it is good in run and gun situations. i just wish it s handle was  sturdier or of massive plastic or sceletonized aluminum  id also recommend Fotodiox to add adapter options to bowens mount.",

I finally settled on this Fotodiox F60 Quick-Collapse 24\" Hexagon Softbox. Now I can't judge on how this will hold up over time as I haven't had it long, there are mixed reviews on that. It's in the mid-price range and seems well built for the price, it does have several plastic parts that may or may not hold up well over time. But what I like about it so far is that it's adjustable, I can angle it up, down, wherever I need it. A lot of them don't have this feature for some reason. It's super easy to set up and take down. I don't have to fight with it like traditional softboxes.  It's also adjustable for a variety of speed light sizes and has the ability to fully insert the head of the speed light so there is very minimal light leakage. Finally the light is quite lovely (see test image below), it has an inner baffle (diffusion panel) like traditional softboxes. Another thing missing from many of these types of softboxes. I like the softness it adds but it is another thing between your subject and the light so you will have a little light loss with that. I don't find that a problem, I think I was only at about 1/8 power on the test image below, with a reflector underneath.",

                "review_body": "I'm giving it 1-star because technically it is what it is (a lens hood) and there is no option for 0 stars. $60+ (retail) for a made in China molded piece of metal that probably cost $3 to manufacture and ship. And, it's not included with the purchase of the $500 17 mm lens. There's more.\nThe lens hood doesn't fit over a filter. You need to put the hood on first and then literally drop a filter onto the lens and wiggle/screw it into place with your fingertips. Incredibly inconvenient if you might want to shoot without the hood, for cleaning or to remove the hood for packing. Also, you cannot use a third-party lens cap with the lens hood. You better not lose that Olympus lens cap. Hmm, I wonder how much a replacement cap costs?\nWith the hood on, it's extremely difficult to get the lens cap off quickly. You better have very small fingers or else forget it.\nI find it hard to believe that this is the only technologically possible lens hood design for the 17mm lens. Combine the above with the gross price mark-up and you have to question if Olympus just wants to stick it to the customer.\nI'd love to sit in the office of Olympus' CEO and watch him try to put on and take off the hood, filter and cap. That would be priceless.",

I will be the first to say that for the premium prices we are paying for these lenses they should include lens hoods and storage bags. Sadly, we all know they do not. I have tried a number of the knock off hoods and some of them have been ok and some have been really bad. I bit the bullet and bought all the Olympus lens hoods for each of my Olympus lenses. I figure these are long term purchases and I would like to enjoy the lenses as intended. The LH-48B is like all the others. The finish is excellent, the construction is solid and the fastener screw tightens down a circular clamp that surrounds the lens instead of pressing directly on the lens like a set screw which will scratch it. Is it expensive? Yes. Is it a premium hood? Most definitely. What might be a better solution is to include a cheaper one for free and offer the premium ones for those who want them. I am not sorry I spent the money but I am particular. If you are not you may not see the value. Five star product two star price. I will give it a four stars overall.",

However, I went for the Olympus Brand hood since I felt that this would be the most sturdy one.  I am pleased with this hood and the 17mm lens will not go out without this nice sturdy hood on it.  The hood has an interesting thumbscrew that attaches the hood to the lens rather than a threaded hood.  The screw pushes a thin metal bar so that the screw does not touch the lens body.  I like this.  The only downside is that this necessary item should have come with the hood. It is expensive at $69!.",

THE 812 WORKS WELL FORALL TYPES OF PHOTOGRAPHY, INCLUDING INDOOR AND OUTDOOR, PORTRAIT AND LANDSCAPE. TIFFEN ALSO MAKES A COMBO FILTER, OF THE 812 AND A CIRCULAR POLARIZER. THE COMBO FILTER GOES A STEP FURTHER IN NOT ONLY ENRICHING THE HUES, BUT IN COMBINING IT WITH THE POLARIZER, THEY HAVE SUCCESSFULLYCREATED A FILTER THAT COMPENSENSATES, DISPERSES, EVENS OUT, AND ENRICHES THE LIGHT WITHOUT DETRACTING FROM THE SUBJECT. THE END RESULT IS A POWERFUL, BRILLIANT SUBJECT ( A GREAT PHOTO OF A MEMORY PRESERVED IN TIME ), IN ALL ITS BRILLANCE.",

Over about 30% of the circumference of the filter, the lens/retaining ring sat less than one thread below the outer surface of the ring as if on installation it had been cross-threaded and was just cranked down until it wouldn't turn anymore instead of being removed and re-seated.

                "review_body": "I've used the Tiffen 812 Warming Filter for over 30 years. I have the 812 on all of my camera lenses. It not only has a nice warming effect, but it also absorbs UV light. Film and digital are both affected by UV light, making an image a little blue. Also it's a good idea to keep one on each of your lenses, to protect the front lens element. After using the 812 I would never go back to using an ordinary skylight filter again.",

                "review_body": "It warms up the color but I wouldn't use it solely for everything. I wouldn't recommend to use it in portrait. The filter pink-like color. So, it pop ups anything in range of this spectra, means: the red tone will be added to your face. A combination of 812 filter with UV Sigma filter reduces this effect and, actually, makes skin color look more natural, I'd compare that combination with Cokin 81C filter. The Tiffen 812 transparency is about half stop, what adds a bit contrast to your pictures. The filter (62mm) well made and did not give a vignetting at 18mm focal length (with Sigma 18-200mm lens) even with UV Sigma filter on. The filter has internal thread which allows to put on another 62mm filter.\nAll in all, the 812 warming filter enhances pictures, it did make my pictures soft, the price is right, in my opinion - worth to buy.",

I was a bit concerned about fit because the Model II is slightly bigger than the last model and its published dimensions are slightly thicker than the published interior dimensions of the case.  But the camera still fits nicely in this case.  Snug but not too snug.  I was surprised that the case came complete with both matching leather wrist and neck straps, and wrapped in a plastic back inside a cloth pull-string bag, inside another plastic bag.  That was a lot of high-end packaging for a $20 product.  The magnetic snap at the bottom of the case works well, and it is easy to pull the camera out for quick shots.

The needs a cutout for the lens like on Canon's case for their S110.  The case flap is enough to protect the lens area.  I'll let the case stretch for a while, and cut the front to fit the lens bulge.

We bought it as a Christmas gifts for our 3 children,  so that they could have a fun and safe socially distant way to spend time with friends during Covid. It was hands down the best purchase we've made. Five stars for sure. The picture quality is super crisp even when you enlarge it to fill a wall! Getting this one with the higher lumins was the game changer. The screen was crisp and bright, colors were how you would want them to be in a professional movie theater. Very happy with this purchase. I also bought a smaller projector (different brand) to try and compare (it had 5500 lumins where this one has over 7000) ....and it did not even compare. This one is bright/crisp. The other one was dull and a little fuzzy.\nMake the jump and get this one if you want crisp and bright pictures (even in a room during the day!)  . You won't be disappointed.",

I rate it 5 stars since you get a lot for the money. Don't expect crazy dynamic contrast with projectors of this price range or to have a high refresh rate for gaming or watching sports. This projector works best when positioned on a shelf, setting it up to low or too high the tilt can deteriorate the sharpness of part of the projected image, so take that into consideration",

For those that don't want to read, understand that this is a Chinese projector and you are getting the usual \"Chinese quality\" with this projector which is not a good thing.\n\nOverall it's built solid and the remote is nice and responsive and has great distance, I can point it at any wall. The fan however is somewhat loud, louder than any off the shelf desktop computer or laptop. The physical keystone works decent, not too accurate but it works, the digital keystone worked pretty well and can change pretty much any angle. I had it sitting on two nightstands stand on top of each other as it needed the height.\n\nThe quality of the image is hard to describe. It is sharp and has not the best brightness but on those two things, it's bearable. The part that is not bearable is the colors. Imagine running a giant magnet on the screen of an old CRT or tube TV and all the colors turn purple, that's what you're paying 500$ for and that's why I'm giving it the rating it's getting. I thought spending more means getting better quality but not in this case, because I could have bought a projector for 100$ that probably had better colors. I did spend more on a NAME BRAND projector, the cheapest one out there, and I'm completely blown away at how bad the Chinese projector is. Do not buy this as your home theater or tv replacement, I would even feel bad buying this for kids. Kids aren't animals they don't deserve something of bad quality. I got this projector for half price I guess on a sale so for like 250$. I started the return process after adjusting every setting professionally to get the colors right and it still didn't look worthy of what I spent.\n\nI bought a used Viewsonic px700hd which is normally 400-500$ but used was 300-350$. Used and all I'll pay 100$ more any day for a name brand projector that displays colors correctly right out of the box. The difference is night and day. Night... and... day... Don't be fooled, if you want a cheap projector, go buy a cheap one for 100$ but if you want something you're going to be happy with, get a real projector. There's no in-between.",

This projector is perfect for that.  The picture is nice and bright.  The screen is comfortable to view with the lights off and curtains open, but best in total darkness.  We were able to connect it to our Chromecast.  The fan can be heard if the movie is really quiet, but with any movie noise you don't notice it.  My only complaint is that the connectivity is a little weird.  My husband is a techie and he had a little trouble getting it all set up through our receiver.  I have no idea what that means, but some of you will.  We still figured out a solution that works for us.  Overall, we are very pleased.

On the surface, the specs look good. The Y31 is 1080p, compared to the Epson's 720p resolution. The Y31 puts out 7000 lux, while the Epson is rated at 2600. The bulb in the Y31 is a LED based unit which can go 100,000 hours between changes, while the quartz bulb in the Epson lasts about 4000 hours on average.\n\nA great upgrade if your vision isn't so hot, or you need to see sharper detail.\n\nNot so fast. Look at the two pics I attached. The Y31 produced the blueish image, while the Epson produced the more white image. Both pics were taken with my cell phone. No matter how much I fiddled with settings, I could NOT eliminate the Y31's blue tint -- what you see is the best I could do. Different HDMI cables made no difference.\n\nSee the difference in resolution? Maybe. Look at the \"wolf creature's\" cheek. I see more detail there, possibly. However, I also can see that the Epson image is more uniformly focused than the Yaber image (look at the time/date in the lower right corners of both pictures).\n\n...and I still can't get past the dim output, which I hope is a flaw in this particular unit. Even the \"High\" output setting didn't really improve things much. So there you go. Whites aren't white.  The \"bright\" setting barely compares to a 7 year old projector. I'll be nice and attribute the shortcomings to a bum unit. However, i will also NOT be getting another one of these as a replacement.",

Set the aspect ratio to point to point and the HDMI output to PC this  provides the most clear and accurate image. 2 Go with a dark room, it's a bright projector but bright light definitely washes out the image some . 3 Connect it to your surround sound if possible.

The issue is that in order to get a focused picture at this distance, the picture size ended up a lot smaller. The Y30 didn't have this issue. Also the fan on the Y31 was loud, even on the lower brightness setting. Not like it was broken, just loud. When the brightness button is pressed to make it brighter, the fan is distractingly loud. The Y30 is much quieter. Also, we noticed blurring in the corners of the image from the Y31. Because of the placement of the shelf being dead center to the screen, I didnt have to use keystone correction, so that wasn't the issue. I will say that the picture was otherwise bright and sharp.

At 8000L you are guaranteed a great picture, even with it pulled back to a large screen size.  The focus and vertical and horizontal adjustments are easy to use and the controller has an intuitive layout that I was able to navigate in the dark without looking at it within the 1st 1 minutes of using it.\nThe only negative would be the fan noise can be a little loud if you are sitting right next to it.  But with a decent sound-bar and it mounted on the ceiling, you wont notice it.  Also during the day with the curtains drawn it produces an ok picture, but I would recommend a higher lumen for a well lit room.  Overall I'm very happy with my purchase and will be using it on a regular basis.",

I needed to have a unit that was capable of keystone that wasn't just top and bottom.  This projector offers a 4D keystone which means I'm able to mount the projector behind me in the upper right corner and out of the way so our shadows don't show on the screen.  The 4D Keystone allows us to adjust the picture to fill the screen as though it was projecting straight onto it.\n\nThis product was packaged with quality and the project feels very high quality.  The picture quality is amazing and can be seen without having to be in darkness.  The daylight from the windows did not take away from the brightness of the picture.  The product was very easy to setup and the included  remote makes easy operation a breeze.\n\nI recommend this product to anyone looking for a great projector with high quality and a bright excellent picture.",

The reviews were good and so I gave it a shot.\n\nIt came down to this one and another one that was about  $150 more, I am so glad I gave it a shot. I tested it both inside and outside and am quite pleased with the image quality and brightness.\n\nFrom my testing, I will be able to have an outdoor movie night start at sunset when the sky is still lit and people can see to get around and situated. I can also watch movies inside the house at any point in the day.\n\nThe one issue that I had was that it took a while (~ 15 to 20 min) to get a good picture. The presets didn't do it, so I went into the user-defined color and picture settings and played with those before I was happy with the results. If you are hypersensitive to picture quality you may be disappointed. I think the image after adjustments would be satisfactory for 95% of people.\n\nAdvice from my errors on adjusting the image quality:\nDon't try to make the adjustments with a movie or show on, use a statice display gradient test image that has both color as well and black and white sections and gradients.",

Wow, this projector beats it in every aspect.  It\u2019s  bright, clear and has good color.  At 1080p native, it\u2019s an upgrade at less than a 10th the price.  With the LED light it should last much longer.  I\u2019ve even tried it with my PS4 playing a racing game and it didn\u2019t miss a frame that can tell.  I\u2019ve only had it a week, so time will tell, but I am impressed.  It\u2019s fan is a little loud, but I\u2019d rather know it\u2019s properly vented than have it melt.

In fact there's no worries if you decided to take the machine with you anywhere you go, all you need to do is to plug in the HDMI cable adapter to your smartphone and kick back and enjoy, also the cooling fan on this projector seems to be quieter then others that I encountered in the past, overall this is a great quality machine, I wouldn\u2019t replaced it for our TV as an everyday used but it\u2019s definitely great to give us that cinema experience and to make for some really fun family movie nights!

The video isn't the sharpest but i wasn't expecting that given the price. If you want super sharp video, you'll need to spend upwards of $1000 of even $2000 for 4K.

It does not have optical zoom, but can be zoomed digitally, which I assume reduces the full resolution, but nice feature. Some other projectors seem to have issues with blurring around the edges where text is out of focus, but I did not notice this on this projector. However, I do have a stand that I use to raise the projector even with my screen, so that may help. The projector also turns off and on quickly. The fan noise is audible, but with sound from a movie you don\u2019t notice it. You also have two brightness setting from the remote to lower/increase the brightness instantly, which should increase LED bulb life and I did noticed that it automatically reduces fan noise. The built in speakers also work great. They are loud, but not great for a huge room and I would sit close to the projector to hear them. The are great though for a portable setup, but I would recommend purchasing some home theater speakers for a permanent setup. Though the projector comes with a power cord, remote, HDMI cable, AV adapter, and cleaning cloth I would like to see a carrying case added or at least an option purchase one separately. Though the cardboard box that the projector comes in can be used, it\u2019s not a long term solution. This is honestly a great 1080P projector for the price.

Also, the sound from the machine is not good - but we have not yet attached external speakers -- hoping we can use a blutooth device to get speakers to work.  The picture was still good, but the device was pretty old.  We don't have another device to attach to it for outdoor at the moment so we will soon be acquiring a new one, or connect via laptop or phone.  I expect the experience to be far superior.

If you sharpen up one side of the screen, the other will be out of focus (consistent with other reviews I read here). And while I like having manual controls for some features, the focus wheel is part of the lens and swings freely - so you'll screw it up by touching any part of the projector, especially the lens cap (who thought that was good idea?). The manual v-keystone (?) also has the free swing issue. Still, it packs a punch for an entry level, experimental projector. Just shame on you, for sending me dead pixels. Shame!",

                "review_body": "I absolutely love my new projector for Yaber. I was scouring through review after review attempting to stumble across a gem and I did when I found a review comparing two Yaber projectors: The y30 and y31. They were both well described; however, the user highlighted the y31 model for its crisp imagery and surround sound. My main concerns were the imagery during the day and a lack of sound, forcing me to spend on external speakers. With the y31 model, the imagery during the day is not the best, I would assume that there are not enough white lumens when compared to other projectors. However, the y31 speakers are phenomenal! More often than not, I try to listen to hear the fan of the projector over whatever show/movie I am watching and it is almost impossible. Many reviews complained about how other projectors needed the volume on max to get a decent sound, but this is not the case with the y31 model. I normally keep my device at a volume of 25-30, while the max is 100. I have also posted a picture to show the image; it is about 9:04 AM, at this time. You can see that there is a bit of light distortion, but overall the curtains in my room have mitigated the light.",

Now that I have a properly functioning one, I use it all the time! The sound is only okay, but you're not buying a surround sound system, and the picture is crystal clear. I have used projectors for a couple years now, and this one is far superior to any I've used before. When you get super close, you can see just how small each pixel is, which is what makes the picture clear and crisp.\n\nPROS:\n- Fantastic picture quality\n- Highly customizable settings\n- Great customer service\n- You can watch during the day if you have decent curtains or wait just a little bit for the sun to go down some\n- Fan is pretty quiet, especially when you start watching something that covers it a bit\n\nCONS:\n-Sound is a little lacking\n- Only one 'save file' of user settings, so you have to change your settings around if they don't work for that time of day/ particular movie (but that's standard)\n\nPICTURE SETTINGS I USE:\nContrast: 40\nBrightness: 60\nColor: 65\nSharpness: 60\nColor Temp: Warm",

We had a pass through sound bar set up so our Roku went through the sound bar then the sound bar attached via hdmi to the projector and it worked great for an hour, then the picture started skipping and it started making a high pitched squealing noise. We hooked the Roku directly into the projector with no sound bar and it worked great again.

I'm satisfied for now.\n\nOriginal review: Well, it was good while it lasted the 8 months. Now there is a horizontal line in the middle of the screen. Top part color is a bit darker than the bottom part. This happened suddenly. Nothing hit the projector as it is mounted high up. Yaber support tried to help me 3 times over the course of a week or so, but could not resolve the issue. Then, told me there is nothing else they can do, but contact Amazon. Their description says \"YABER provides 6-month back and 5-year repair...\", but don't believe it. Great picture while it was, but I'm going to have to recommend staying away from this one.",

Also I used it in three spots in one night: I pointed it towards the front bay window on rear projection for a Halloween scare for my son. I need to figure out a better screen for that situation so I wrote the company and the owner wrote back offering to help. That\u2019s pretty incredible nowadays. Then we moved it outside and it was amazing on a sheet. Then we set it back up in the movie room. Super easy and light to move and set up. So, honestly, with the pandemic going on and no Halloween this year-this projector kind of was the hero that saved Halloween. Looking forward to using it like this for the upcoming holidays. I guess something like Bluetooth might be helpful but you can get a usb dongle for that if you need it, but my Amazon fire sends it to my speaker or my laptop does too.

Its bright enough to use durring the day (don't expect miracles but I can watch most things with the lights on illuminating the entire screen). The fan is a little loud but for how bright it is I appreciate the attention to thermals, hopefully giving this unit a long lifespan. The best feature is the digital keystone correction! So normally with a projector like this if your not dead level and the projector is not pointed at the dead center of the screen you will have to adjust the keystone manually to create a plumb image (perfect rectangle). The issue with that is when you adjust the mirror to correct the shape of screen a little focus is lost at the very top or bottom, this can be most observed in netflix looking at words. However with this beauty you can set the manual keystone to get not a plumb image but perfect focus on the entire screen, then use the digital keystone to get a perfect rectangle. The end result is a perfect or as close to perfect as you can get image.\n\nLove this projector and hope for years of use out of it!",

Basically you need to physically move the projector further or closer to the wall to change the screen size (some other projectors allow you to do this with a dial on the lens, this model does not).\nNot a huge deal, but something to keep in mind.\nAlso works great for mario kart at night on a 20x40 canvas in the back yard!

With that brightness you should be able to watch a movie in plain daylight, and it is not possible with this projector. I have a quite old 2600 Lumens projector, and you really can't tell much of a difference with it regarding brightness. And the picture, even when the resolution is high, you can't really focus it in order to read clearly very small numbers (like the movie's length or the current minute you're in). I think there is a problem with the corners or the sides, or maybe you need a really flat surface and for the projector to be perfectly aligned perpendicularly to it, to reach a better focus, that with my older projector I did get.\n\nAs for the onscreen menu, again, my old BenQ projector is much more complete and professional looking.\n\nI should have guessed this was not a serious company when they have an outlook.com email address, and don't even have a website.\n\nMaybe I'm asking too much for my money, since it is really not that expensive, but if you offer something you must deliver. You can't advertise what is not true. It is totally misleading. I am very dissapointed. I guess that for this price I couldn't honestly get anything better; however, I expected the information provided to be true.

Before I would consider getting an expensive projector, I figure I'd get a cheap one to see how much I actually used it before saving and committing to a more expensive projector. The Yaber projector is a mixed bag. Here's Why:\n\nCons:\n-Not suitable for daytime use: The furthest extent of light it can handle is lamps at night in the room not directly around it. Sunlight bleeds out the image drastically.\n-Contrast Ratio has much to be desired: The range is pretty limited. Want white white, black with be gray, and what black blacks, image will be dark. I tried a variety of combinations when it came to the contrast/brightness settings and I could never find a sweet spot due to the projector's limitations\n-The remote worked for a week, now I am unable to use it. Amazon said I had to send back the whole projector and they couldn't get hold of the manufacturer. Keep this in mind when buying it. It breaks, you own it.\n-Fan Noise is Loud\n-corners blurry\n\nPros:\n-Although no mechanical zoom function, there is a digital image reduction for up to 75%\n-At the price you get a pretty big screen projection for the money\n-Image quality is good enough for watching movies (4K has spoiled us)\n\nIn summary, if you want a 1080p projector for under $500 to see if you like it, this is it.

It does not have a metal halide lamp as many do it but it uses a bright LED lamp. Again not something you find in a $250 unit. It also has a LCD screen through which the lamp projects and not a crazy wheel of colors that cuts down on the output. From my research it appears that the projectors that use a color wheel that spins in front of the lamp tends to cut the lamp output by 1/3 or more. That means a 6000 Lumen lamp is putting out 6000 lumen, but what gets outside the projector is only about 4,000 lumens.\n\nI am not an expert by any means but I am in pressed after doing a bit of research on projectors. I was able to clearly see the projection even with lights on in the room. And this unit does work with Dolby Surround Sound which is why I went with this projector. The controls seem fairly straightforward and the remote is very simple. I did a little bit of playing with the vertical Keystone and it worked sweet.  I am anxious to get a ceiling mount and hook this projector into my system.\n\nAt this point, after reading several reviews, I was pleasantly surprised with what came.  And even at 12 feet from the screen, I could not get it small enough to fit on the screen!\n\nOh, i sent an email to the Yaber customer service and received a response in 2 hours.

This really puzzles me because as I set-up the unit and it was clear and completely in focus from top to bottom. I like to watch movies with closed captioning and the focus was remarkable.\nTake time to play with the set-up so the amount of color,  brightness, etc suit your needs.

The picture quality is clear and the internal speakers really create a loud and clear sound.\n\nThe input multiple options are also very helpful, especially the HDMI and USB ports. That way you can leave a more permanent setup and not have to continue changing cables from different sources. You can use the HDMI inputs for cable boxes, video game consoles, and Blu-ray players. You can use the USB ports for streaming sticks and stored videos. And you can use the VGA cable to hook up to a desktop or laptop, if you have a more office-functional idea for using the projector. The rear and front projection options are also great to have as they give you more options on where to set the projector and your screen.\n\nYou can also purchase an AnyCast USB adapter that will add a wifi streaming/mirroring option which is convenient if you don't want to deal with cables.\n\nOne wish is that it came with a traveling/packing case for portability. But that may seem a little unnecessary to certain users who are not planning on moving the projector place to place.\n\nOverall great product, especially for the price. It is an extremely superior entry-level projector, and doesn't break your wallet if you're considering starting to use projectors for viewing experiences. I see myself enjoying more and more sports games and movies outside this summer.",

The menu is easy to understand and navigate, though the potentially useful option to reduce the screen size by 25 percent is not always easy to trigger with the arrows on the unit or the remote. The picture is bright and the 3-watt internal speakers produce adequate sound. There are plenty of inputs on the back, with two USB ports on one side. Be sure, however, that your indoor space is of the right dimensions to make the most of the Y31. When I placed the projector in my usual place for a projector, 15 feet from my living room wall, the enormous screen covered much more than my white wall, and lost much of the image by plunging deep into the bathroom. Even with a reduction, the screen remained too big. (Optimal throw is between about 5.8 and 12.8 feet, the very good user manual said.) It wasn't practical in my rustic summer cottage to move the projector forward for a smaller (and presumably sharper) image, nor was the sharpness at the long distance all that I wanted, so I reluctantly returned the product. There should be no problem at all outdoors. I like Yaber's design and engineering, and I will be a future customer.",

It was crisp and clear. 3) The setup and adjustment was pretty straight forward. I had no trouble. My dislike was the fan noise. I set this up in a quiet room, a place where the volume for viewing would be low, and the sound of the fan was just too much for what I needed. The other thing that really rubbed me wrong was the statement from the manufacturer included in the box: \"Due to Amazon's rules, once a customer makes a comment, our seller cannot find the buyer's contact information in any way, making it difficult to have a two-way conversation and quickly resolve the issue. The product gets a huge impact from your negative review, and you don't get your problem solved quickly.\"  This just strikes me as a threat to not give bad reviews or they won't help you resolve problems in a timely manner.

My set up is less than ideal due to throw distance and a ceiling fan, it\u2019s at quite the angle, but I managed to get it pretty close.\n\nThe throw distance was the exact same as my old projector, and so was the power cord( has to splice the original to make it longer)  so it was literally plug and play for me with the\nsame mount I had been using.",

I have installed and trouble shot, many many high end projectors. Clearly, this is not a high end projector, but it\u2019s great for the price. Yaber will tell you that the zoom feature is in the \u201cpicture menu\u201d. They will tell you that you go into that menu, and then into the submenu, entitled \u201cimage reduction\u201d. Really?? No. All that image reduction does...is reduce the size of the image. In other words, zoom out. Any quality projector always has a zoom in/zoom out feature. That is a VERY basic feature. To not have that is very odd indeed.\n\nSo in short? You literally have to mount (if you ceiling mount this projector as I did) the projector either a bit too far away from the screen, then zoom in, (\u201cimage reduction) OR...mount it EXACTLY where it needs to be. Very inconvenient.\n\nSo be aware of this, before you buy this projector. It will save you a huge headache. Had Yaber included this little tidbit of information in the product description? It would have saved me A LOT of time and frustration in the installation process. Yeah. Not cool.\n\nSo 4 stars. I would\u2019ve given this projector 5 stars...if it had a normal zoom in/zoom out feature.\n\nAgain, this is not some \u201cluxury\u201d feature. Every projector is supposed to have a basic zoom in/zoom out. It should be automatic.",

I bought it to make a budget theater in my basement. After seeing so many positive reviews, for this, was so very thankful I did. As can see from my pictures, I put up a 150\" screen, and it fills it very nice, bright to the edges, I'm sure it could go bigger no problem. The screen measures 6\" high by 11\" wide of viewable area, projector is 15' away, fits perfect under my 7' ceiling. We sit like 6' back, and get the immersive feeling I was looking for, like you would get in the theater! Projector gives lots of hookup options, even gives you some cables you need. Everything but popcorn! I connect to a sound system, but the built in speaker sounds great too.\nAlso used it last Halloween to project a video in our window, we had compliments from pretty much everyone! Just used a cheap frosted shower liner and long piece of molding, and hung in the window. A company with atmos in the name has all kinds of videos you can download, for just this purpose!\nSuper happy with and would recommend!",

The remote control is very similar to a FireTV remote with tactile buttons.  The internal speakers are rather quiet, but they do overpower the sound of the fan.  About audio output, there is a 3.5mm headphone jack, along with a 3.5mm A/V jack which could be used to get stereo sound.

I'd say the Yager 6200 is only about 30% as bright as my TV. So if you are looking for a complete TV replacement, this will disappoint in terms of brightness (at least during the day).\n\nFurther Observations:\nAll these 'budget' projectors are clearly made in China. There are other products that look exactly the same (search \"6200 Lumen Projector\"). Name branded projectors range in the thousands. So, in terms of 'bang for your buck', any projector that looks the same probably is the same, and is your best bet.",

The ability to shrink to screen is helpful, because it allows me to position it where I want to. For sound quality, I am currently use the Yaber device. I'm pretty impressed with how it sounds for a projector. It has good depth and doesn't seem to be coming from one speaker.  I only wish I could get it louder.

About a month ago, I purchased a smaller 720p native projector with 5000 \u201clux\u201d because the price was well under $100. While that projector did work fine for a kids basement playroom (very dark), I found the image quality and brightness to be so poor that I would never choose to sit down and watch a show or movie on it without my kids.\n\nI did quite a bit of comparative analysis and settled on the Yaber Y31 primarily because of the advertised 7200 \u201clux\u201d, 10,000:1 contrast ratio, and LED light source while still maintaining a price under $300. For the price paid... the Y31 is excellent. No doubt better projectors can be purchased, but I felt investing in a more expensive projector also warranted investing in the rest of the high dollar equipment that goes along with it (screen, surround sound). Before you know it, you are into a fun idea for well over $2000.\n\nI still prefer the vibrance an actual TV for daily/regular watching, but this projector is a great, inexpensive solution to achieve that theater effect. I am projecting around 130\u201d-140\u201d on a gray wall (PPG Storm\u2019s Coming) and am using a Roku 4K streaming stick as a source. I also opted to use the Roku App \u201cPrivate Listening\u201d feature with a wired speaker for better sound without having wires strung all over my room. Tip: a big screen seems even bigger with big sound.\n\n_____________________\n\nPhoto 1: Smaller, brighter screen is the Yaber Y31. The larger dimmer, screen is the Elephas E9. I know the Y31 is closer to the wall which may make it slightly brighter, but it was easier to take the photo and the Y31 maintains almost identical brightness at full size.\n\nPhoto 2: Mandalorian at 130\u201dish in an nearly blacked out room.",

                "review_body": "I really wanted to like this projector, and TBH, the same day (Sunday) delivery from Amazon did get me out of a Monday morning bind when the 12-year old conference room projector blew its lamp ballast power module (which is no longer available), BUT there are some major gaps in quality between them...\n\nOne may need to wear out a few sets of batteries in the remote before the color balance is acceptable, and some of that may be just giving up and settling for the bluish-green tint that doesn't seem to be correctable - whites just aren't!  It's conceivable that the color issues could be corrected by a software update, although I'm doubtful, but the biggest flaw that is absolutely NOT correctable, is that the optics are really cheap.  Focus the center of the screen, and only about 10% of the screen will be in focus, and the outer edges will be very blurry, so you will have to compromise on your focus.  Didn't have this issue with the last 2 projectors mounted in the exact same spot, so I know it isn't my screen.\n\nIn addition, the cheap optics means that there is NO manually (optical) adjustable throw - they handle that function by allowing you to digitally adjust the size of your picture to frame your screen if it doesn't fit exactly where you mount your projector.  A far cry from the previous model, and you can completely forget about color calibration. The remote doesn't come with batteries (2x AAA), but the unit cheap, and that's part of where they cut corners to shave the cost...\n\nIt probably isn't fair to compare this quality level to a projector quality that cost 3-4 times as much, but the glowing marketing will never warn folks about the shortcomings of this product, and I am not sure I would have bought it if I'd know beforehand what I would get.  In this case, you get a cheap projector, so if you're looking for a cheap 1080p projector, this will do you, and it's probably ok for watching a movie on, but a full-screen spreadsheet will give you a headache trying to focus on most of it, because it just isn't physically possible.  Watching sports on it might be ok too, but I don't know, as I don't.\n\nThis one will stand in for now, while I shop for a better replacement, and then it will sit on the shelf as an emergency backup only.  There's no reason for me to update this review down the road, because the major flaws with this unit are baked-in, and can't be fixed, so it can't really get better where it counts.",

                "review_body": "This little projector is very capable. I've been using this projector for the past 2 weeks in a brightly lit room. Like any other projector of this class, I can only use this after nightfall as even small amounts of natural sunlight greatly reduces contrast. However, incandescent lighting in neighboring rooms at night does not seem to have much impact. So you don't need total darkness.\n\nIn my case the projector projects clear images on a 100\" screen. The projection distance is about 14-ft. I like the feature of having a zoom adjustment. This allows the image to be scaled down to 75% which I need for the distances and screen size. Images upto 120\" are still pretty clear. The projection suffers during fast action sequences however.\n\nWhile it is true that the projector takes Dolby AC-3 sources, the inbuilt speakers are not strong. The fan is not very quiet either and you need the projector at least 5-6 feet away from you for it to be less annoying. The projector only outputs analog stereo sound. So if you need to enjoy full surround you would need a capable HDMI splitter or route the video source through your receiver and connect its monitor output to the projector.\n\nHaving a manual keystone (to keep image perfectly rectangular) adjustment is also great. I try to keep my projector head-on and minimize the need for it. It works well for minor corrections. Larger corrections make images sharp on one side and less so on the other. I have not tried the remote control and have not found a need for it. I am able to achieve reasonably crisp focus with the manual focus ring as well.\n\nOut of the box, the projector seems to have good color balance. The power cord is of reasonable length. The included HDMI and audio cables is a bonus.\n\nI hightly recommend the projector for casual viewing. If you are a videophile, I suggest you look elsewhere.",

While it retains the settings (the value) after power dn/ up cycle, it is not reflected on the screen (meaning the angle is off). If i use the remote to change the value by one & then back to the setting that is saved it the applies the change to the screen.  Support asked if i make adjustments every time, but I don not.... it is a bug in the settings & the projector just will not retail the keystone angles I set once it is powered off.  It is really frustrating that I have to reset this every single time I turn on the projector.\n\nAlso, I was promised a free projector screen with purchase but I still never received it, even after a few emails to Yaber.\n\nWhen reaching out to support, they appear helpful, but they don't really follow through on resolving any of the issues I have had.",

                "review_body": "We were looking for a good projector to use for outdoor movies over the summer \u2014 projecting them onto a screen we hung about five feet into our garage and projected from out in the driveway  (Our garage is east-facing).  I found that we were able to start movies with reasonable visibility 20-30 minutes after sunset.  It was not bright enough to run it any earlier than that though in an outdoor setting.\n\nClarity was a challenge, though.  In order to maintain equal focal clarity across the entire span of the picture, you couldn't muck with the pitch or angle correction on the projector.  Doing so would invariably make one end more out of focus than the other and would throw off the clarity.  So if you don't mind the top and bottom of the picture being slightly distorted in size (if projecting from near the ground), you can get a relatively even focus level.  But the minute you start adjusting the angle of the picture, you will degrade the focal quality.\n\nThe onboard apps were nice for directly showing YouTube or Netflix videos \u2014 we used that on a few occasions.  MY BIG GRIPE THOUGH.... for services that require a PIN number (like Netflix) for parental controls, there IS NO MEANS to mask the PIN that you're entering.  \"OK kids, everyone look away.... and no peeking!\"  They really should address this and give a numeric pad on the remote control and mask the input of PIN numbers.\n\nOn the whole was good value for the cost, but lacked clarity and had minor user interface things that could have been improved.",

                "review_body": "Pros: 1.  Super clear and vibrant picture- way better than the other comparable projector I ordered to compare.  2.  Very bright- and I like the option on the remote to make it even brighter but didn't really need to in the pitch dark.  Haven't tried it outside yet but did with full light coming in the window in the early evening and with lights on (3rd picture) and still had vibrant colors and great quality.  3.  Adjustment to zoom or reduce screen size. Even though this has to be done with remote, it's a nice feature to have for different uses. 4. Easy set up and portable\n\nCons: 1.  biggest complaint (reason for only 4 stars)- No adjustment on the bottom to modify the hight of the lens when the unit is sitting on a table- this is odd as most others I have looked at had this adjustment.  This is an easy fix by just placing something under the unit to get it at the right height to project on my screen.  2.  No manual adjustment on the unit for zoom, has to be done with remote (more expensive name brand models have this but not a deal breaker for me).  3.  Speakers are not loud but I plan on using a sound bar so not concerned with that\n\nAll in all this is a great projector for the price range I was willing to pay.  Will just be using for family outdoor movies and other special occasions but really wanted a clear picture.  This is probably the best you can get without spending a lot more on name brand!\nPictures attached are on a 100\" screen purchased from Amazon too.",

                "review_body": "We did a side by side comparison of the Yaber Y30 and Y31, the picture brightness is comparable to the extent that I couldn't tell the difference inside with the lights on but both were plenty bright in that scenario. The Y31 focusing mechanism is easier to work in general with less chance of your good hearted but clumsy friend getting their finger prints on the lens, a little harder to fine tune imo, but the \"good enough\" range is bigger. The user interface on the Y31 is more intuitive and more idiot proof, like anyone who's held a remote in the last 10 years could operate it without the manual. The Y31 remote does have one button that doesn't seem to do anything but to be fair I haven't looked in to it further. The Y31 has less options in some regards but overall better presets. The upward tilt on both is pretty primitive imo, with screw in front feet that you have to manually adjust, like screw them to x depth, put it down, how high is it, pick it up, screw them a little more check again, etc, but the Y30 only has 1 foot and the Y31 has 2 and feels more sturdy. The fan on the Y31 is considerably louder, and you can hear a big change when you switch from 6800 to 7000 lumens but, and this was the biggest deciding factor, the sound on the Y31, without exporting to external speakers, is so much louder and also more rich and varied. Just way way better. The Y30 has a standard/mono and two different surround sound settings and was alright, and presets for movie/music/sports/game, but can only export to left/right. The Y31 has all that but the internal surround sound option is loud enough at 50% that you can't hear the fan at all and any louder than like 60% would be too loud for our backyard on a school night, I could hear little tones/details in the couple familiar samples we listened to that honestly I never even noticed before, and you can adjust individually every tonal range/hrtz, as well as being able to be ingegrated with Dolby surround. So for streaming concerts or your fav tunes to muted cartoons, which is how I will most use my projector, I think there's really no question that the Y31 is the way to go.",

You just aren\u2019t. If you\u2019re looking for super high def, ultra clear, etc etc then spend the money on what you\u2019re looking for and stop whining when you don\u2019t get it at this price point. I\u2019ve had this projector for nearly a year and aside from really slow customer service that is available only by email with zero other connect options it\u2019s not a bad a little setup. Sound quality is terrible on its own but I added in surround sound and no more sound issues. Not very good in a room with a lot of daylight, it just isn\u2019t bright enough, but for my bedroom that I\u2019m only in at night the brightness is more than fine. As a primary device for a main room that I would use to watch tv on every day for everything this wouldn\u2019t work and would not be a good option for that. As a secondary device for a darker room that you aren\u2019t going to use for everything daily then you\u2019re good. Again, be realistic in your expectations of a $200 projector and you\u2019ll be fine. If anything, try it and if it doesn\u2019t work for you then return it.

                "review_body": "First off, this is advertised as both 7,000 Lux and 7,000 Lumens. It's in no way a 7,000 lumen projector, it's somewhere around 1,000. But I knew for the price it couldn't possibly be that bright so it's OK.\n\nTo get the most out of it I made my own screen. Basically I painted a mixture of a quart of untinted metallic silver paint and 10oz of Seal Grey on a 4x8 sheet of MDF and made a PVC support/frame for the back of it. If you Google \"Easy Ambient Light Rejecting Screen Paint\" it should pull up a forum post from avsforum that goes into more detail. On top of that I also blacked out the windows to try to make the room as dark as possible.\n\nYou can get a surprisingly sharp image from this projector too but you really need to have it lined up just right. Usually, a projector is placed at the bottom of an image but this one seems to work best when leveled with the center of the screen, at least from a front projection, it may perform differently if mounted upside down. There's a bunch of keystone options to make the image fit however you have it aimed, but when you do that you lose image quality and the image may not be perfectly focused all around. It's worth it to spend the extra few bucks on a 30\" or 40\" projector stand depending on where you're projecting from and what to.\n\nThe very slight issue that I have is with the remote. It won't let me play files from a USB when I hit the OK button, but if I hit the OK button on the projector itself they play just fine. I've reached out to the seller and they are sending me a replacement remote. But even if that doesn't fix it, I'm OK with it because the projector will always be where I can reach it.\n\nThe speaker on it is pretty good for what it is but I usually connect to a soundbar. When the weather cools down and we do movie nights outside I'll just hook up to a small portable speaker I think.\n\nOverall we've been very happy and have been loving our family movie nights!\n\nUPDATE: I found that the remote works just fine. After selecting the video file on the USB you'll see a red check mark, then press the center top button for it to play.",

I did a lot of research and this projector had the best features for the best price. I wish it had Bluetooth, but I realized I could pair Bluetooth speakers with the fire stick I\u2019m using with the projector. So problem solved.\n\nThe biggest issue I\u2019m having is adjusting the picture. I can\u2019t get this to adjust right no matter what I do. The picture is always skewed wrong. I just ordered a projector tripod that I\u2019m hoping will help with minute adjustments that I can\u2019t get with just a table. The directions are pretty vague and I don\u2019t fully understand how to get the picture to adjust fully. The last thing I want to do during a get together is spend the entire time trying to get the picture straight on the screen. I wish it had some kind of auto adjust feature. It\u2019s clearly meant to be a permanently installed, adjust once, in home unit. I\u2019m not sure if this is going to work for a quick outdoor, plug and play, movie night. I\u2019ll keep working on the settings and see if I can get it to a point of not having to mess with it so muchevery time. It\u2019s quite large, so know that\u2019s it\u2019s not anywhere close to a pocket projector.\n\nThe picture quality seems great though. I\u2019m happy with the projection clarity and contrast. The brightness adjustment is a bit of a joke. It seems it only has two brightness options, light or dark. There\u2019s no in between options that I can find. For the price it\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll take the word of the more experienced reviewers and the specs since I don\u2019t have anything to compare it to.\n\nThe speaker is not great, so plan on hooking up other speakers. I\u2019m waiting for the outdoor Bluetooth speakers I want to go on sale that I will pair with my Amazon fire stick. I did a trial run with my Echo and it paired perfectly.",

                "review_body": "So I basically bought this projector because it was a very cheap alternative to replacing my trusty steed, an Optimum DPL 25 that is on its last legs. Can\u2019t say I have been disappointed by brightness. The fan is a bit loud. The remote is great, but the most glaring off attribute about this projector is quite easily the color profile. I don\u2019t know if this is normal, and maybe I\u2019ll see some replies from either the manufacturer or other users, but the color profile runs insanely cool. A lot of blue and a lot of green. This was driving me nuts for a while, but despite that the picture has seemed pretty good. However, I think I may have gotten about as close as I can to a normal pallet but the settings are pretty extreme. While the user settings start red, green, and blue at 50 I found that I had to turn Green and Blue drastically down: Green to 14, and Blue to an incredible 08, while Red on the other end I have running at a whopping 98.\n\nThe biggest thing you\u2019ll notice here is that this is an RGB projector. I still can\u2019t complain because this is less than half the price of a better projector with a dimmer bulb. I don\u2019t think this projector would be able to do so well with the brightness with the finicky nature of the YMCB color wheel.\n\nPlay with your settings, especially try to mirror something between two screens. If you\u2019re using an Apple TV, I\u2019ve noticed the \u2018\u2019 match frame rate\u201d setting in the Apple TV definitely gets you better quality on playback. It also adjusts rather quickly, which it didn\u2019t on my old projector, but at the same time I didn\u2019t need to do that. Wish I had done a little more research before buying this since I watch a ton of movies and probably would have opted for something more expensive and accurate, but I have to say this is a game changer for daytime viewing. Overall, at this price point it\u2019s pretty difficult to complain.",

That has 4-point keystone (Yaber only \"4D\" keystone which means only vert and horiz) so the PJ40 you can put high/low/to the side pretty much anywhere in reason and adjust to a good screen shape.

The PJ40 fan is adjustable 1-10 with corresponding noise reduction - at 1 it's still plenty bright for most uses and is almost silent.\n\nIf you want to save the most money and you will always have your projector centered, Groview JQ818C has a good picture and is fairly quiet.\n\nIf you can spend 250, the Nexigo PJ40 you can put just about anywhere, great brightness and great quietness control.  Also its remote has HDMI CEC so you can control a connected Fire TV interface without changing remotes - fantastic.  A great deal in my opinion for what you're getting.\n\nThis Yaber Y31 falls in the middle price wise but doesn't really move the needle over the Groview.  It's okay if you absolutely need just vert and horizontal keystone and can only spend 170.",

                "review_body": "I bought a Yaber 31 and it was total junk.  Turns out it was simply a defective projector.  Yaber customer service was fantastic and made a few offers to help but after a couple of e-mails which they responded to the next day, they agreed to accept the return and gave us full credit.  In a previous review I gave the projector a 1 and customer service 5.  Yaber customer service then contacted me after issuing the credit and offered me a free projector.  Fearing a scam I told them they already gave me credit for the old one.  They again contacted me and ended up sending me another Taber 31 to try out.  My original projector was simply defective.  The new Yaber 31 works wonderfully in a smaller room, the darker the better.  One of my complaints was on the brightness. I thought this was a 7K lumens projector and it is 7K Luc.  There is a HUGE difference between a lumen and a lux after 1square meter. So if you room is more than 3X3 get ready for a dimmer picture. I tried the new projector in 3 different rooms. The first the size of a bedroom about 10x12.  Fairly dark great picture and the sound really surprised me at how good it was.  Turn on even one light and be prepared for a washed out picture.  Tried again in a 15X 25 room in low light and again good picture in the dark on the 15 foot wall.  Tried it in a 50X50 room with about a 17 foot throw up high on the wall.  That's where this projector really shines.  Not the large room terribly - washed out - but in the keystone correction.  Incredible how well it did and all controls are very easily run from the remote control.\nIs this a good projector?  Depends on what you want it for.  I wanted it for the large semi lit room.  Not the projector you want for that.  Living room size or smaller?  The darker the better but a really good projector especially at the price point.  Especially if the LED bulb lasts as long as they say it will.  We spent almost as much on bulbs for the projector that this replaced as we did for the projector!  While the projector is pretty good making it worth a 3 star review, the incredible customer service and lengths Yaber went to, to make up for a bad projector and customer experience is overwhelming and bumps it up a star.  I would not be afraid to use this company again.  Fantastic experience in making sure the customer was satisfied.",

                "review_body": "6/9/21 Update: Added 1 star. Ok. I decided to hook my Vivitek back up with a new bulb in it.  Picture is much clearer and easier to focus from top to bottom. The Y31 still looked terrible compared to my H1080 (ceiling mounted at 16ft) when using my long-run HDMI cord hooked to XBox.\nI then hooked just a blu-ray player up to the Y31 and tried from 6ft 8in with no incline and the picture was a ton better. Then I moved it to 16ft with no incline (so stacked on some stuff to have 0-degree incline each time). The picture was still better than when connected to the Xbox, but not as crisp as when at 6ft 8in. I can't easily test the Xbox at the 6ft 8in distance, so not sure if it's the XBox, but I'm guessing it's the long-run HDMI (30ft maybe?) that was causing the really bad picture...although I have no issues with my Vivitek on this HDMI cable.\nI will say that word or subtitles are still harder to focus on the Y31 regardless. It's really hard to get the top and the bottom clearly focused.  If you are watching normal shows or things without text...the blurriness is harder to notice and you could come to believe it's a 'crystal clear' picture. If this had been my first projector I'd probably have thought it was awesome. However, my Vivitek that is 10 years old looks way better, so I can't go back.\nMy takeaways: Y31..shorter your distance from screen...the better it will look. Brightness was good. Colors good in general. Contrast ok. I have a HD picture tuning Blu-Ray (Y31 was better on color than my Vivitek, but brightness and contrast adjusting not quite as good). It's good for a entry level and will get the job done, but I'm not sure how anyone can say it looks better than their 4k LCD tv. I will be returning. Not planning on any more tests, but if I do I will update.\n\nOriginal: My Vivitek H1080 I purchased 10 years ago is much crisper and better looking. Colors more vibrant, text focuses easily.  I've been straining my eyes today trying to fix this to look better. I must say I don't believe this is native 1080p.  My Xbox One allows you to choose between 720p and 1080p output.  I've tried this and they both look essentially the same on a 120\" screen. I can't see any noticeable difference.  I just got a bulb for my Vivitek as well, but was trying to avoid the $50-75 bulbs every year if an LCD would last much longer and give me the same quality.\nWatching Netflix and such...seems like I went back in time as the picture isn't as good as anything I've had for a long, long time. I'm already leaning on returning this.  I like the price point of course and figured 10 years after my Vivitek this should be comparable at least.\nI'm going to keep trying things for a bit, but unless there is a firmware update to fix this...I don't see much hope as\nI've exhausted about all attempts to adjust.",

I noticed a difference in the size of the YABER 31 right out of the box; it almost twice as large as the other two I own, and the lens is much larger as well (see pic). It was much easier to control the focus (it didn\u2019t lock like my other two) and the picture quality was definitely HD. Even my wife, who can\u2019t really tell the difference between DVD and BLU-Ray quality immediately notices how sharp and colorful it was when connected to our Apple TV (the pics are my projecting the image onto the side of our vaulted ceilings during the early afternoon; I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be even better when we use it at night. You will want to do some image calibration out of the box to get the best image you can, but that\u2019s a given with any TV or projector, and the settings are pretty straightforward.  The remote ACTUALLY WORKS and you have several types of inputs, from 2 USB ports, 2 HDMI ports, a VGA connector,  A/V input, all the cables you need for the connections, and outputs for headphones or external speakers. Speaking of sound (no pun intended), this projector comes with a better built-in speaker than my other two; I had them connected to an external speaker for sound and the sound quality on this one is noticeably better without connecting to an external speaker. The max screen size is pretty generous, more than enough for my 140\u201d projector screen for outdoor movie nights. I\u2019d say it was well worth the price point.",

                "review_body": "Before settling on the Yaber Y31 model, I had compared four other projector's, (including the Yaber Y30) from about 50 bucks up to this unit which was a little over $240 on a lightning sale. I decided seeing the difference between each one that it was worth the money in terms of long-term satisfaction of having a nice sharp clear picture with a native1080P resolution and the highest possible brightness and contrast ratio. Of course you can spend several thousand and have performance very close to a flat screen television but for much less I am very satisfied with the way this projector performs. It was especially nice to have on a camping trip as you see in the photos. We were amazed at the realistic look of Sandra Bullock and George Clooney floating around in space on a 10 ft. screen in the movie \"Gravity\" out in the beautiful wilderness of Colorado. Since it was pretty chilly at night, we pulled the car behind the projector sitting on a tripod mountable shelf, connected a bluetooth transmitter dongle to the audio output, and had a bluetooth speaker in the SUV, so we had our homemade drive-in theater while staying cozy warm in the car!\n\nWe used a 300W/500 WH battery invertor generator for power, and I had tested the time it would last and got about 3.5 hours out of it before having to recharge (using a solar panel the next day). So having the numbers from watt-hours and 3.5 hrs. run time, I figured the run wattage on the Yaber to be about 120-125 watts. I have seen the question raised repeatedly on various projector listing pages asking for wattage, pobably for this very reason- how long will my projector last on a battery generator? So it would be very helpful for more of these companies to give that statistic on the sale page (and the owner's manual) to help when calculating a model that fits needs for remote power, such as camping. I will contact Yaber and offer that suggestion to add that info.\n\nI did dock the remote control by 1 star because Yaber went backwards from the Y30 to the Y31. The 30's remote had dedicated buttons for ff, rw, next, and go back functions, but on the 31 remote those functions require navigating an on-screen menu bar and hitting \"OK\". Why make the latest model less user friendly from it's predecessor?...so IMO, a backwards move...oh well...at least it's somewhat minor, and I love everything else about it, and would recomend it to others, keeping in mind that if you're picky about pictue quality, it's worth the higher price over the low level models, and Prime store card holders can easily afford this better model buing it with 6 months no interest payments, so it's a WIN-WIN!!",

It was only 5 mos old. I spent $30 to send it back and the communication completely stopped. So now they have my $230 projector that I spent $30 to send them and since they stopped talking to me, I just bought the Rovomko and like it so far. Brighter than the Yaber and it was nearly $100 less. Pass on this one!\n\nSO HERE'S A NEW UPDATE...\nThis is crazy... So, I bought one of these in 2022, had the screen develop the brown spot, saw in reviews that they'd replaced faulty units, so contacted them to the point of  sending the unit back as you see above. Everything above was posted as my review after they failed to reply to me for a couple of months. Suddenly, though, they were able to reply to one of my email and had some story about how they had no communication ability for some reason, whatever. BUT, haha... they give me a whatsapp number to use to text them. Well, now I'm just interested... I installed whatsapp and contacted them and they tell me that if they send me a new unit, if it works great, would I remove my review? Sure, whatever. So the new one arrives, I take the Rovomko down, put this one up, and it's ok. Not as sharp as the original one I bought... actually, I should say, with the same settings, the keystoning seemed to adversely effect the picture - differently from my first one - and it was only very sharp in the center to top half of the screen. The first unit was pretty tack-sharp for 90% of the center of the viewing area. Again... whatever. Well, a couple of months go by and we are obnoxiously careful with the thing. If we watched a movie or show, we set the shutdown timer for 2 or 3 hours so there'd never be any question of overuse/leaving it on too long. Seemed ok for a couple of months, but then started developing the big brown spot - kinda looks like a  tornado in the center top right of screen, at least this time it's not dead center so actor's faces aren't discolored.\nNow, today I reviewed another item and thought about editing my original review (the one that inspired them to contact me) and it was no where to be found, and the product is no longer available. So I click on \"Write a Review\" and it bring me to this screen, with everything up to today's edit populating the fields. So, that's a little \"What the hell\"-ish..\n\nSO.. the crappy second unit is still playing... the spot seems to have stopped getting bigger, but certainly prominant... otherwise we've seriously just not dealt with it much... I end up just leaving my 8 year old HP Omen 32\" on all the time and watching on that. But, eventually, I'll have a few minutes to put the Rovomko up there, and maybe there'll be a glowing review for them in the future. We still want to do the projector thing, but we're saving for an Epson or Sony. This one, no matter what, it seems, always ends up being a $250 paperweight.\n\nAnd BOO on the company and how all this played out. Whatsapp, haha.",

                "review_body": "Because of the Stay at Home situation, family was coming from New York City to my rural area in order to escape COVID virus exposure. We kept thinking of things we could do since we couldn't go anywhere. At some point I decided to look into a projector so we could watch movies outdoors in the summer nights. I was an absolute novice as to what I was looking for in the way of a projector. I was teased at first because I had seen numerous projectors under $100 so that more than fit my budget without a doubt. Being the skeptic that I am, I stepped back and thought that it sounds too good to be true. I decided I need to become familiar with projector specs and scoured the internet further. I then came across some name brand projectors, like Epson, which were priced much higher in the $700 - $1,000 range - NOT in my budget. I did however look at the specs to see what it provided that cheaper projectors didn't have. I watched various YouTube videos to get more familiar and reached a point where I knew what to be careful about in the descriptions of less expensive ones. This made me realize that there are various deceiving claims to be aware of. Being confused with sooooo many projectors having brand names that were completely unknown to me, I was thinking maybe I should play it safe and buy from a local store so I could return it if I was not satisfied. I noticed that they favored just one brand with decent reviews and was priced around $300. However, before pulling the trigger, I searched the internet some more and focused on reviews. Lo & behold I came across the Yaber 31 projector which was in my price range, had great specs and the reviews were very favorable and so helpful. It was then that I felt very good about making a blind purchase of a brand I was not familiar with. I pulled the trigger to make the purchase. I was very pleased with the prompt shipping of my order. The package arrived earlier than the estimated arrival date. It came on a Friday together with the 100\" folding screen I ordered from another merchant on Amazon. A few of us unboxed it that evening in eagerness to do our first outdoor movie night. We found a tree branch - hung the screen and began making adjustments. I had an Amazon Fire Stick I also ordered, so we plugged it in and it was pretty much an easy setup for our tech savviness level. We had a movie up and running within a half hour. As we fine tuned the projector to expand the full length of the screen, I became ecstatic how awesome the clarity and HD quality was being projected. Everyone was amazed and could not believe how nice our movie looked on a screen in the dark night of our yard. The projector itself has a very good sound, but we ran a Bose speaker via bluetooth then corded which gave us a better sound for everyone to hear. We had a successful showing with a group of 21 people and EVERYONE gave two thumbs up when the movie ended. Since that night, everyone has looked forward to our Friday movie night. Our crowd spread to neighbors coming over as well and said they've never seen anyone having a simple projector to view outdoor movies. They too commented positively on the quality and asked me where I purchased it. One night during the week, we projected YouTube video on an interior wall just before it was dark and actually had a viewable image. In the evening the picture became deeper in rich color and was just as amazing as the one on the screen. This Yaber 31 projector has been truly my best purchase of the year. Stop looking any further, add to your Cart and Checkout immediately before these might run out of stock and you'll miss the joy I'm having with it. Happy watching!",

                "review_body": "***** Updated 11Sep2021 ****\nYaber did contact me and agreed to ship a replacement projector. They paid shipping to me, but I had to pay the shipping of the faulty projector to them.\nThey said that the orange faded area is caused by using too much without giving it time turned off. I do use it regularly, but their description of the projector does NOT say that it is for intermittent use only. I asked if the failed part is something that  I could replace myself but did not receive an answer to that. Their response was \"you should buy a more expensive projector\". So all in all, if you are looking for a projector for intermittent use with very clear picture, good brightness, and less expensive, I suggest the Y31 from Yaber. The company was good to send a replacement. I don't know how many times to expect them to replace it during the 3year warranty. Time will tell. I'll update as time goes forward.\n\n*****  Updated 17Aug2021 ****\nThis projector has been great for several months, but it now has a large section of the top right of the screen with an orange hue. [I saw another review saying that is caused by the polarizer.] I don't know what the problem is, but this unit stated that it had a three year warranty when I purchased it. Unfortunately, I cannot find a way to contact the company Yaber (their Amazon page does NOT have a contact section.)  I NEED HELP! This projector is not even one year old. I LOVED the picture when the orange areas was not there. But it is now very difficult to read portions of the screen where the orange section is located. PLEASE contact me to get this resolved. I will update the review appropriately afterward. Thanks.\n\n ----  Original Review ----\nThe picture is absolutely stunning! And after having owned an LED projector for several years, I was totally blown away by the level of brightness and contrast. Contrast is critical when watching videos that are darker themed. The brightness does not compare with the other brand projector with the 250W halogen bulb, but the price is also less than half. I can use this projector in a lighted room as long as the sun is not shining brightly thru the windows. In that case, we just close the curtains and continue :)  The digital keystone correction works very nicely as well, although the manual keystone correction is useless since the lens has a single focal length and slanting the lens causes either top or bottom to go out of focus. That's consistent on ALL manual keystone adjustment projectors. The happy thing is that this projector also has the 4D digital keystone projection that works flawlessly. I LOVE this projector.\nFor this price, you can NOT beat this purchase. MUCH cheaper than a big screen tv, and the picture quality is stunning! Get one!!!!",

I was originally expected to receive this on the 8th of July, but somehow they shipped it out pretty much immediately and I received this yesterday.\n\nSetup is extremely easy. Plug and play and everything is intuitive. No bells and whistles. Just plug in the wires, point at a wall (I am lucky in that I have a plain white wall in my bedroom so I didn't need a screen).\n\nThe picture quality genuinely surprised me in a good way. I was half expecting some sort of flaw, but for the price I got much more than I expected in terms of picture quality. This projector really is not meant to be used with ambient lighting which I didn't plan on doing anyways, so it suits my needs. I have black out curtains in my bedroom and I don't really like a lot of light, so this works for me.\n\nIt's definitely not the brightest projector in the world, but in complete darkness the contrast is fantastic. The color reproduction is great and the image is sharp where it matters. There are some out of focus areas at the corners, but when watching a movie that does not matter.\n\nI set it up to about 90\" without a screen and the image is still very sharp. It's definitely 1080p (in case anyone thinks that it might not be). I played 1080p video and 720p video of the same content, and there is a visible difference.\n\nIf you're a projector veteran, this might seem like it has a lot less features. But for my use it's more than enough. All I need it for is to watch blockbusters. I won't be using it for gaming. I tested it for gaming, and it's alright. If you're a PS3 era gamer (PS4 pro won't work on this as well because PS4 pro offers 60fps gaming, while this projector will only refresh at 24-30Hz as it's built for movies), I think this should be ok for you. I'm a PC gamer and this was definitely not up to the mark. I have a 21:9 34\" 144Hz screen for gaming, so I don't need this.\n\nYou do need a stand. I have an adjustable laptop stand (with rise and tilt ability) which I am using and I would recommend getting something similar otherwise you won't have the best experience.\n\nYou also want to get a proper lens cleaning kit and clean the lens before first use because mine came with a lot of dust on the lens. It's not a big deal, but in case you have a dirty lens, you might end up with a blurry image and it won't even be the fault of the projector itself.\n\nOverall:\n\nPicture Quality: 5 out 5 (based on budget pricing)\nContrast Ratio: 3 out 5 (is not very effective during daylight or with any light really)\nColor Reproduction: 5 out of 5\nFeatures: 3 out of 5\nEase of Use: 5 out of 5\n\nRecommended if you can pick it up for 230 again (seems like the 50 dollar off coupon wasn't being offered at the time of submitting this review). It might not be a bad investment at 280 even if you're looking for something that doesn't break the bank, but still gives a decent picture quality.",

                "review_body": "This is my first projector so I can\u2019t compare this one to any others. I bought it for a new setup in my room, which will be in a couple of months. Right now I have it set up temporarily and projecting it to a textured (painted), off-white wall.\n\nSo far this projector has been awesome, even with my temporary set up. The built-in speaker is not bad at all. It does get a little tinny/buzzy at high volumes or with certain pitches, but it\u2019s definitely sufficient for casual viewing. I plan on using it with a sound bar and an aux cable, which I have already tested. I also tested HDMI passthrough with another sound bar, and both work well.\n\nThe video quality is great, especially for a projector at this price point. Again, this is my first projector, so I don\u2019t have anything to reference or compare it to. I don\u2019t expect to be watching anything in super high quality, but it\u2019s good enough for my bedroom setup. I\u2019m using it with an Apple TV and a PS4 Pro. It\u2019s very hard to see dark scenes even with just a little bit of ambient light, so it\u2019s best to watch those in a very dark room. If you\u2019re watching a show or playing a video game with a lot of bright scenes or environments, then it should be totally fine in a room with ambient light.\n\nSet up is super easy and the menus are very clear and concise. It does have two levels of brightness, but they aren\u2019t too drastically different. The brighter option does cause the fan to run louder. Speaking of which, the fan noise isn\u2019t too bad. It\u2019s definitely noticeable, but I personally tune it out after a minute or two of whatever I\u2019m watching. Keystone adjustment is great and allows you to get a clear picture in all areas of the screen. The only thing it doesn\u2019t have is zoom \u2013 or at least I haven\u2019t figured out how to do it \u2013 so the screen size depends on how far away from the wall the projector is. There may be something about that in the manual, but I haven\u2019t read it. Who reads manuals??? :)\n\nOverall I\u2019m very happy and excited about this and can\u2019t wait to get a screen set up a sound bar hooked up to it. I\u2019ll update my review if anything changes!",

I had to use a hammer and punch to get it off and would have to file it down to make it fit. Since there's no adjustment it would need a very close fit for every copy (wouldn't mount at all on an EOS-M). The TU-100B looks like it's made to be loose and requires adjustment to fit but it's a safer bet. If you don't need it to be that long you might look at the TU-100B instead. I mainly wanted better grip for holding the camera in between shots but I don't find the shorter grip to be awkward for taking shots either. Either way, it's better than not having one since it does give a more stable hold and they won't cost you almost $200 for the one Fuji is selling.",

The edges are really soft and out of focus, but you can use that to your advantage to create some really interesting and dreamy shots...  This isn't an everyday lens, but it can be great for portraits and isolating a subject in the center of the frame.  If you are considering it, just buy it.  It costs less than a tank of gas.",

A warning, this lens has to be use ONLY in MANUAL mode, so you need to know what you are doing here. The focus and aperture ring are not that smooth, but they'll get the job done. The maximum aperture of F1.7 lets in a lot of light, so it works VERY VERY good. But the soft and dark corners it has won;t give you the BEST look. As I said, for FUN will do the trick, for serious photography...I don't think so.",

I think owning equipment that forces you to work in a different way, or brings new, possibly non-traditional elements into the work, is the best part. To that end, this lens is the best camera accessory I've ever bought, and has made me realize a $30 lens can be better than a $1000 one for a specific task. For the record, I'm using a Sony A6000.",

It will give a new life to your camera :). I have a Sony A5100 and you have to remember to go into the camera settings and allow the camera to take pictures even when no lens is detected. This is necessary because the camera won't detect the lens is there. There is no zoom and focus is manual which makes it a lot of fun. Really recommend this lens for any beginner looking for fun shots at a low price.",

If you can manage to have a scene where there are things close to you on the edges of the frame, and the main subject at hand far away from the camera, you can achieve a wonderful effect of the edges being clear while the center is clear as well, with other superfluous things being blurry.\n\nAnd you certainly can't beat the price.",

Nice bokeh, good in low light. Obviously not the crispiest image and only the center point will be in focus, but be creative and it's a great effect.

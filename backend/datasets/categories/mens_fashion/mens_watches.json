Stylish.\n\nUpdate: less than 3 months after I purchased the watch , the battery died. When we carefully went to take the battery out, the back of the watch which is plastic, snapped. We contacted amazon support however it was past the time in which we could be assisted by Amazon. They did reach out on our behalf to the seller. When we did speak with the distributor, we were given an address to mail the item back for repairs.  We have to pay for the shipping back and forth. For a$200 watch to be broken less than 90 days after purchase is extremely disappointing.",

CHARGE THE PHONE, IT WAS DEAD WHEN I GOT MINE, TAKES 2 HOURS. YOU PUSH THE BOTTOM BUTTON FOR 2 SECONDS TO POWER ON THE WATCH. PAIR IT WITH YOUR PHONE( Bluetooth on ok). EASY. NOW THE PART NOT IN THE INSTRUCTIONS ANYWHERE. PLEASE READ:\n\nQUICK PRESS OF TOP BUTTON ON RH SIDE OF THE WATCH AND YOU GET GOOGLE ASSISTANT NOT ALEXA. I LOOKED EVERYWHERE AND COULD NOT GET ALEXA  TO ANSWER. HERES THE TRICK, HOLD THE TOP BUTTON DOWN! BOOM ALEXA IS THERE. WOW THAT NEEDS ADDED TO THE MANUAL. WATCH IS GREAT, MANUAL SUCKS.\n\nIts great. It has a lot of cool features without looking like a TV strapped to your wrist. Looks like a large watch, a nice large watch that is a little heavy but not too bad. I would recommend this product.\n\nCons: can't play music from Amazon. Seems limited a bit. It would be nice if I could get it to talk to my Dot and Fire TV. I'm still looking to see if that's possible. I just got the watch so if I figure that out I will add it to this review later. I want a real help section, the basics are there but my God you don't even show us how to talk to Alexa, the reason we bought this model of smart watch. That's kinda stupid.\n\nThis watch does a lot more than it says so poke around and try things. It's a quality piece. I can't understand why people build all these features into smart phones and watches and never tell anyone. Why would ya do that? Anyway yep buy this if you want an Alexa watch. The speaker is tiny so she sounds a little muffled but you can hear her just fine.\n\nWe finally have a real Dick Tracy watch! Enjoy.\n\nEdit: I found the real owners manual. Go to the Guess app on your phone. Settings-Help and Support-Owners Manual. There is the real manual. There should have been a printed copy of that included in the box, thats too hard to find. There is a lot of good info there though.",

                "review_body": "I really want to love this watch.  The main reason I purchased it was because of the Alexa compatibility.  Bottom line, the watch is nice.  I can make calls relatively easily and send and receive texts.  I have not been able to get Alexa working and the Guess app is ridiculous.  There are no back button capabilities so I have to keep getting out of it and going back in.  The Guess website is basically no help.  It told me to get new firmware for the watch. Really????  I just took it out of the box today!!  So I did that.  I then restarted my phone.  Then restarted the watch.  Nothing.  No \"Alexa Tab\" as the FAQ's Alexa section told me I should see.  I sent an e-mail to the Guess Connect support people.  We shall see where it goes.  Bottom line...If Alexa is not part of this, I will return it.  I guess I am used to Amazon products.  I have purchased the Kindle Fire, Echo, Tap, Dot, Fire TV and yes...I even have a Fire Phone.  I have never had this much of an issue setting up any of the aforementioned  products.\nMore to come if I hear back from anyone.\nUPDATE!! 1-18-17- Never received an e-mail or call from the Guess people.  Called Amazon and spoke to Hunter.  He was great.  He got me a number for the Guess people.  I called and pressed all the appropriate numbers only to be disconnected almost immediately.  I called back.  Spoke to Stephanie.  She could not help but transferred gave me a number of someone who could.  Called that number.  Pressed all the appropriate numbers and was quickly disconnected.  Called back and spoke to a man who did not give his name.  I explained I could not connect the watch to Alexa and that was the main reason I purchased the watch.  Was asked what type of phone I had.  I replied android.  He then told me to check the Guess Connect APP version I had downloaded.  I went to the app and told him v2.0.3.  He said that was the problem.  Alexa will not work without v2.0.5.  I explained that was not an option ion the google play app store.  And furthermore, the app store states that v2.0.3 was released last Wednesday, 1/11/17 and it specifically addresses Alexa.  He said no, I need v2.0.5.  Ok, I replied.  How can I get this.  He stated he would look into it and call me tomorrow.  More to come.\n**Final Update** 2-2-17- I will keep this brief.  My Fire phone is not capable of downloading the Guess Connect App in it's entirety.  The Alexa piece would not come through.  I contacted Amazon at least 9 times and unfortunately I could not get anybody to help.  The Fire Phone is no longer supported.  I purchased a new cell phone, under duress, and the app came through perfectly.  The watch now has Alexa capabilities and I would like to change my review of the watch to 5 stars.  It works like a dream.  Texting, calls, and Alexa work perfectly.",

Top 5 Fitness watches in order of best after I've used all of them. This watch is also great at answering calls! Literally no one realizes I'm speaking through my watch, they think i just have the phone to my ear. That's how clear it is!!! I love how it seamlessly pairs with my phone too, automatically measures my heart rate, barometric pressure in the air, and much more! Honestly I'm most excited about trying the Parkour mode! While I don't know if it actually teaches me parkour, I'm a life long athlete so I'll learn some how and then record it with this watch! Super excited!",

It consistently misses the first half mile or so of any run, walk, or hike.

The Oneplus Health app is pretty helpful so I think I'll just grow happier as I learn to make use of all the functions.\n\nI hate wearing watches so this has been an adjustment.

                "review_body": "Getting directly to this watch, on paper it was everything that I wanted. It's a fitness tracker with fast charging that works and a good battery life. In reality, this is a rough draft of a product. Sure, it looks nice and does some of the basics well. I even like that it's a bit conservative with steps. It tracked closely to manually counted steps and didn't pick up other actions as steps. Heart rate functionality is perfectly accurate. I compared it against a withings blind pressure cuff, the blood pressure cuff at the dentist and doctors office as well as the one at a blood plasma donation center. It tracks very well against medical grade equipment. It'll that I'm also very overweight. I'm in the mid-300 lbs now after coming down from the mid-400s, I'm used to devices getting these basics wrong or over compensating.\n\nThe issues that come into play are numerous. You cannot sync data to Google Fit with the latest version of the app, Google blocks access completely. Some people have found success with a greatly outdated version of the OnePlus Health app, but that shouldn't be necessary.\n\nYou cannot disable phone notifications, every call buzzes your wrist. I've gone into settings and disabled every permission. That stopped texts from going through, but calls still come through. I've contacted OnePlus support and they confirmed that the only way to stop this is to uninstall their app.\n\nSo their app has a ridiculous amount of access to do whatever it wants on your phone, even when you deny use of every single permission that it asks for.\n\nSince you can't sync to Google Fit, the data is silo'd and it isn't presented well in their own app. I've been bouncing between fitness trackers for about a year now. The OnePlus Health App is the absolute worst one that I've used. I've used $30 bands that did much more, synced to Google Fit and presented data properly while respecting permissions. I've used more expensive watches. This is the only one with this issue and that's highly disappointing.\n\nIt's such a shame that OnePlus has created such a beautiful watch that gets some of the fundamentals down well, only for it to ruin the experience in an easily fixable way. I was rooting for them. I don't want a smart phone on my wrist. I don't want data silo'd. I don't want to be tied to subpar software that hinders my ability to track and quantify my health journey. OnePlus can do better, they've just chosen not to do so.\n\nI was a huge OnePlus fan. It seems like everything from them as of late is compromised. Like there's some intentional design flaw because they decided to compromise and this watch is the absolute strongest sign of their fall.",

I panicked, assuming I would eventually find it (I haven't) but immediately ordered another 'just in case.\" I don't use anywhere near all its functions but I tend to be sedentary and it keeps me focused on moving. I was fine with the simple Vivofit but they're pretty homely. The Venu looks good and makes me happy.\nThe battery only lasts about 5 days but it recharges very quickly.",

                "review_body": "This was my first fitness watch.  Just wanted the most basic and cheap.  TLDR:  it\u2019s been relatively ok and can\u2019t complain since price was so cheap.\n\nFar as the renewed aspect, the watch came looking very new, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to tell you if used or new.  Battery wise, however,I\u2019ve been experiencing problems.  I\u2019d charge at night and when I take off in the morning, it says no battery and needs charging, then I have to plug the charger back in and take out, and then it says 100%.  Not sure if software or hardware.  After first 10 days or so of use, I\u2019m noticing my battery is running out much much faster.  When I first got, I thought would last me a few days between charges, but now, I see the longest it will last is 2 days.  If I work out both days, won\u2019t last even the 2 days and would need a charge on the second day even without gps or music. Im not sure if this is normal for this model or if it\u2019s a refurbish issue.  I suspect this watch won\u2019t last too long because of this battery life issue.  But I intended for it to be my first introduction to see if fitness watches would be useful to me at all.  So far, it\u2019s serving that purpose but I suspect it won\u2019t last half a year due to this battery issue.\n\nI bought because I wanted a cheap watch with basic but reliable functions, I considered returning due to the battery issues that are not instilling confidence, but since replace option doesn\u2019t seem available, only return option available, and because I don\u2019t see any other substitute in this price range with this many features and Garmin sensor reliability, obverse made up my mind to use it until it stops working, not worth the hassle of returning for me.  Since I\u2019ve gotten more used to the watch functionality, I\u2019ve gotten quite attached to it, replaced the horrible strap which has that annoying locking nub on the second loop that made the watch feel so horrible to put on or take off, and got a cheap stretchy nylon band on Amazon, much better.  I found HR seems very accurate and fast.  Functions took a long time to get used to, but since I have gotten used to, feel fine.\n\nDownloading music apps was horrible.  If any problems power cycle the watch and it will start again.  If any problems with this watch first snd foremost power cycle.  Seems to fix a lot of issues.  Deezer and Spotify needs sub fees, so I downloaded Amazon music  instead since I\u2019ve got prime.  Trying to download a playlist takes forever, think maybe half an hour,  but once done, no problems.  Paired with Bluetooth easily.\n\nSo far, I\u2019m liking the Garmin way of doing things  once I got used to it.  I mean the quality sensors, no nonsense aspects, no subscriptions required, etc., But battery is concerning and if this watch finally dies a few months down the road, because the renewed price and flash deal price was so good, I don\u2019t think I can complain much.  If it lasts me 6 months, for what I paid, I\u2019ll think I\u2019ve gotten my moneys worth, and I\u2019ll likley look for a similar replacement but maybe a newer model just for the increased battery.\n\nIn a nutshell, basic functional smart watch that feels like a very good value if price is factored in.  Suspect battery.",

                "review_body": "[No compensation of any kind was received in connection with this review.]\n\nI'll try to focus my comments on this specific refurbished item, rather than on the Garmin Venu itself.\n\nThat said, it's odd that the name of the product is mis-typed.  It arrived in the box pictured in the Amazon listing, a box that contained the watch, a charging cable, and nothing else.  I've got a Garmin Instinct watch that uses the same cable, so this cable is a useful backup.  That also means that I already had Garmin Connect installed on my phone, so setting up the Venu was easy and familiar.  But setup might not be so simple for someone less accustomed to Garmin devices.  The Venu watch was cosmetically perfect on arrival; not a mark anywhere.\n\nSetup and pairing with my phone was easy and painless.  The watch has since updated its software a few times, and Garmin Connect works with it exactly as it does with my Garmin Instinct, which I did not buy as refurbished.  I've installed a few watchfaces with Garmin Connect IQ, and that process was straightforward.  I've played with quite a few of the settings and everything seemed to react as expected.\n\nWith Activity Tracking enabled, I get about 6 days on a charge of the battery.  I usually disable that option and then get just over 10 days on a charge.  Admittedly, my usage habits don't stress the battery a lot:  I don't play music on the Venu, I'm not constantly fiddling with it, and my preferred watchface is low impact.  Still, 6 -- 10 days is pretty fair; I'd conclude there's nothing wrong with the battery.\n\nIn short, I haven't yet found anything wrong with this product: it appears to be genuine, and it functions as it would had I paid full price.  My reservations (and they are minor) relate to the design and construction of the watch, and those would apply equally to the full priced item.  With that in mind, 5 stars:  this is one of the better purchases I've made on Amazon.  It's the best of many smartwatches that I've tried, and by choosing refurbished I got a discount of around $100 from Amazon's usual price, along with no shortcomings that I can find.  Excellent!",

Everything is easy to use the step counter is awesome its great having all these options right at your wrist. I would definitely recommend this If you're just getting into smart watches and arent sure if you will really use it.

It looks like a watch and is feature rich NO not as refined and user friendly as Apple watch 3 up but its no knockoff either. Turn off tilt to wake when sleep if you must keep it on and i do sometimes but as long as it gets me through the day and it does then I'm good with this.

Finally it's here. The battery on this watch lasts almost 2 days (although I charge it nightly) of regular use, always on display enabled, and no power saving settings enabled.\n\nThe UI is very clean and easy to use with very few glitches and lag. I like that you have the option for 2 quick apps with the top and bottom buttons. I use the bottom for my Viper SmartStart so I can start my car from my watch.\n\nSadly I already got a few scratches in the screen. I am used to the raised bezel of the Gear S2 but this doesn't have that extra protection. I like the looks of how flat it is more but it does remove that protection.\n\nAs for finger prints, they don't show as much as many other touch screen devices and are easier to wipe off.\n\nOverall I love this watch and am very happy I got it. I plan on getting more Fossil watches because of how great this one is.",

This watch is completely unless for me unless I want to turn on my bathroom lights from China.. All I want to be able to do is ask it to remind me to do something and not have to be wearing the  watch and have it show up on any of my devices, especially my Google displays what's your also basically useless.  I think it would at least do that and it does not. The only personal assistant app that works across all devices is Cortana and there is no Cortana enabled watch But there are Alexa enabled watches and Alexa has a Cortana skil. Cortana cannot control two Philue Hue Hubs and according to Googlei you  can't do that either. But you have to trick it and it can do it. So this watch can do that, but it waste of money for me and I'm going to give it and all my Google devices away because suddenly Amazon Alexa has improved 10 times and is really good at controlling everything. I think the Google fit app is absolutely horrific! I have no problems at all when I had an Apple watch keeping track of my fitness and this watch is constantly disconnecting I never know whether it's connec.ted or not and I'm just glad to get rid of it. Soon I'll be back using an iPhone probably. Their watch won't do what I want either. and Amazon support says I can't do that with an Alexa enabled watch what I want to do, but I can because it has Cortana build inside and that's the only personal assistant that actually works across all devices and nothing else does, but it can't control two Philips hue hubs and that's just insane! That's Philips Hue's problem. and when I called Phillips and ask them about that, they said yes you have to have a different account for each hub. They kind of laughed like it was a joke.  and it really is because the Philips Hue app is the worst app for controlling the Philips Hue lights. Alexa does not even have my current account information and it discovers all my devices and so does Siri but Siri I cannot get Cortana or Alexa on the watch so I'm going for one of these $150 Alexa enabled watches and it's going to be the best thing I've ever done. And this Fossil  iwagch is bulky an ugly compared to my Samsung watch which is just as useless. And the watch faces are horrific they're just ugly ugly ugly ugly. I really hate this watch and I hate myself for spending $300 on it. I spent thousands of dollars in smart devices in I think they're all a bunch of junk but if you're going to get anything get all Alexa stuff that's my suggestion it's turned out to be the best of them all.",

I can call from my watch- dial, pick contacts. I can answer calls on my watch and there is a built in speaker + microphone so I can pick if I want to have a speaker call or route the call to my headset (bluetooth) or handset (phone). I can initiate texts from the watch. I can set stopwatch timers on my watch, play games, health tracker, etc.\n I do have a smaller wrist (female) so the bands are a little long.

It blows me away that my $60 and years old Fitbit Versa is able to consistently monitor my heart rate no matter if I'm running or sitting and yet this $200+ dollar full-blown smartwatch can't manage to read it half the time, even when I'm sitting perfectly still. This is unacceptable, and I honestly don't know how they messed it up this bad. The second problem is the battery life - even with all the cool features turned off on the phone (always-on display, NFC, etc) this smartwatch BARELY manages a full day of very light use.\n\nDo yourself a favor and look elsewhere for a smartwatch. I will either be returning or reselling this one as soon as I can so I can do what I should have done in the first place and get a more reputable brand.\n\nEDIT: I actually came back after using this watch for a few months to bring my score down from two stars to one, and I would give it zero stars if I could. This watch is a straight up piece of garbage, truly. In addition to the problems I mentioned in my initial review, after a few months of use the watch has started having all sorts of software glitches, regardless of keeping the OS updated. For example: every few days all my tiles will disappear, and you can't even re-add them to use them again because the watch still thinks they're there even though they can't be seen or used. I also didn't think this would be possible, but the battery has gotten even worse. Even will nearly every advanced feature turned off, this watch lasts LESS THAN A DAY now of extremely light use. Just stay away from this watch, unless you like wasting money.",

It doesn't have all of the health features a dedicated sport watch might have, but that's okay - it's not trying to be a sport watch.  The newer processor is snappy and there are many ways to easily customize the watch to your liking with different watch faces and bands.  It has 1Gb of ram and 8Gb of rom so there's plenty of space to store your favorite songs on the watch.  There is onboard GPS so you don't have to take your phone with you in order to track your run and the battery easily lasts more than a day with almost all of the features enabled.

I mainly use this watch for work and I am lucky if I can make it through the 8 hour mark. Even if it does make it past the 8 hour mark the watch almost always needs to activate \"extended mode\" which defeats the purpose of having a watch since I can't tell the time with the screen off.\n\nThe watch bands are not exactly sturdy either, I actually had to order replacement bands since one side tore off just a few days after recieving the watch ?????. Now granted, as I said, I do use this watch for work and I'm not sure this was designed to be a work watch but I'm not a construction worker or anything, I am a delivery driver for God's sake.\n\nLastly the overall design of the watch is flawed. I bend my wrist ever so slightly and the power button is long pressed which activates Google assistant which is insanely annoying. Every day at work I hear off into the distance \"I'm sorry I did not catch that\", making me paranoid that google is listening to me haha. A very flawed design. I've looked tirelessly for a way to maybe map assistant to an on screen button or something instead of the main turn dial, but to no avail.\n\nMy girlfriend uses an apple watch and it seems to work so efficiently for her...

If this generation has purportedly better life than the previous, I shudder to think of how long a 4th generation lasted. After 14 hours from removal from charger after an overnight charge, the watch was at 11% batter remaining. Not too bad, right? Wrong. The watch was on it's 'power save' mode for the entire duration of this time. It's power-save mode, however, prohibits most of it's useful functions. For example, you must manually turn power-save mode off to even attempt to use Google Pay. The watch does, however, charge fully in a little over an hour.\n\n-Now the real killer: iOS compatibility. While it's iOS compatibility isn't marketed as heavily as it's 'extended battery life,' it is equally as abysmal. Extremely frustrating to initially pair with the phone. Then, once it's paired, it will erratically disconnect throughout the day unless the Google Wear OS is actively open on the paired phone. Reconnecting is usually a series of button presses in the application and on the watch itself. Not through the usual Bluetooth interface. To compound the matter, manually removing the watch from my remembered Bluetooth devices (in an attempt to avoid further connectivity issues) led to an odyssey spanning two-and-a-half hours that included a hard factory restore of the watch and the painfully long process of re-adding all my payment methods to Google Pay and pushing them to the watch. No, it's not automated nor a simply login process. I question the developer's marketing of this product as iOS compatible.\n\nPros:\n\n-The watch itself is beautiful. Infinitely more attractive than any Fit Bit or Apple Watch I've ever owned or seen.\n\n-Charging is very quick (45 minutes to an hour-fifteen)\n\n-Lightweight\n\n-No issues with water resistance\n\nConclusion:\nIt's a beautiful timepiece. I cannot stress that enough. I could honestly deal with the battery life if it wasn't essentially a piece of non-functional jewelry when regarded with iOS in mind. I was seriously considering just buying an extra charger and charging in my car when required. That was before I realized the compatibility issues, of course. While it may be a great watch, it's definitely not something I'd switch to an Android for.\n\nTL;DR:\nPoor battery performance and iOS compatibility. Shockingly beautiful watch.",

Battery life that is well, not the best but I also have all of the fancy features turned on. The battery will last from 7am to 12 to 1am usually.

Inconsistent with the battery life based on load. For example, a little load uses a little battery. While a lot of load uses a lot of battery x2. So if you have a lot of updates pending I definitely suggest you have a charger near by. It's worth noting I don't have an issue with the battery life, some may think this watch should have an unrealistic battery life. No it's not ground breaking. It's far from where apple is at. But with everything in mind the 17+ hours from this watch is more than enough for me. The screen looks nice and has a high ppi. The watch doesn't lag behind under normal use. Heavy use could slow it down but not enough for it to really bother me. Worn it at work with pressurized water flying everywhere. Hasn't broken it yet. Washed my hands with it in all the time.

If you limit that and don't have a constant stream of notifications, it seems to hold its charge for most of the day. My main gripe with the watch is how sensitive it is. I've had the watch for around a week and it has already come undone many times, two of those times the screen completely disconnected from the band and fell on the floor. The pins that separate the watch face from the band are very easily triggered. Thankfully, it still works fine. It also refused to turn on at one point for seemingly no reason, but the issue resolved when I gently wiped the pins that connects the watch to the band. Overall fairly happy, but it's definitely not perfect. I'm not sure how long it will last.",

As I was wearing Fossil Gen5, I found out that my regular walking will quickly ramping up a HR of 120+ even it's only a 3 mph pace. My running HR also displayed quickly from 160 to 190 with a mild 4.2 mph!!! I'm 65 with a max. recommended HR in 155. So it really bothers me since I'm aware that I got lots of capacity to run faster but the HR display shown is seriously beyond my limit!\nLuckily I searched on the web and found an article titled \"Fitness trackers aren\u2019t very accurate at measuring heart rate \u2014 and that can be dangerous\" :https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/13/13268506/fitness-trackers-heart-rate-apple-watch-fitbit-mio-basis\n\nI decided to compare the Fossil HR vs. Oximeter's reading. What I found is that Fossil HR reading at resting or casual moving is pretty accurate compared with Oximeter. But during exercises, this is what I found out:\n1. For walking: When the FOSSIL HR numbers in 120 range, it's 25+-5 OVER compared to Oximeter reading\n2. For running: When the FOSSIL HR numbers in 160 range, it's 50+-10 OVER compared to Oximeter\n\nI almost wanted to see my cardiologist for extremely high HR reading during exercises, luckily I found out that it's a problem from the Smartwatch's reading rather than my heart. Fossil is a very reputable company, it should really make it a known issue to the customer, so people knows if it can be used to monitor HR during exercise. Or it should improve the accuracy of the HR sensor and firmware/software, so consumer can get a more reliable readings for their exercise.",

Too expensive - Fossil is not as strong tech brand as Samsung, yet Samsung watches are cheaper with the same functionality.\n2. The heart rate sensor is useless - it measures higher rate than actual when moving (when you need it the most) and lower rate when not moving much (e.g. weightlifting). Effectively, one needs a separate fitness watch for workout or stress management.\n3. The battery modes are sticky - e.g. if the watch reaches 15% of battery, it helpfully suggests more conservative mode, but that mode remains even after the phone is charged. In my case, I ended up with a $300 watch that had the functionality of a $20 one until I figured out how to reverse the change.\n\nUpdate (01/16/2021): #3 above self-resolved after a few updates, but unfortunately ~14 month after I bought it, the charging ring fell off. It turned out that the glue that holds it is not very strong. I tried to glue it back but it still wouldn't charge. I am keeping the 4 stars as the watch lasted over a year.",

The hardware is pretty much unbeatable for the price. Heart rate monitoring is great, the speaker and mic is clear enough to make phone calls on, and the battery life is enough to last a full day of normal use (with pretty much all features enabled).\nNow, onto the bad part. Wear OS (at the time of writing), to put it simply, sucks. A lot. Sometimes, it will disconnect your watch from Bluetooth for no reason, won't connect automatically, and has quite a few weird bugs. Now I'm assuming Google will continue to improve it, but right now, it's not very good. It works (with some inconveniences) but I think the hardware makes up for most of it.\nIn short, Fossil has made a great watch, really stylish, durable (I use a SuperShieldz screen protector and have banged it up quite a bit with no visible damage to the watch whatsoever), and half the price of its competitors. So I do recommend it, but just be aware that there are some inconveniences with Wear OS (but I don't think it's fair to fault Fossil for them).",

                "review_body": "Well, to start with I just moved over from the iOS ecosystem to Android world, and love my new, shiny Samsung Galaxy Note 10. So, this Fossil Gen 5 release date was Godsend to coincide with my decision to switch to Android and Note 10 release as my old Apple Watch won't work with my new Android phone.\n\nAbsolutely floored by the slim design of Fossil Watch, how easily it connected with my Note 10. Aesthetics wise I like it more than my Apple Watch; even got praises on how well it looks.\n\nAnd the fascination just stopped there. I wish the screen could be more brighter. I have set the brightness at 5 (maximum) and I still thinks it's not bright enough. And the battery life. Within just 6 hours of use, my watch came down from 100% to 24%! Well, the watch boasts of \"Extended\" and \"Time Only\" modes in addition to the \"Daily\" mode (with all the smart features enabled). I looked at the \"Extended\" mode setting to find out that all the features are set to OFF in the watch except you can hit the crown to wake up your watch, notifications and vibrations are On, and the Bluetooth is available from 6 AM - 10 PM only. All the cool options, such as Speaker, WiFi, Touch-to-wake, Tilt-to-Wake, NFC, OK Google detect options are disabled.\n\nCome on; I bought a smart watch for a reason. Otherwise, $295 would have fetched me a very stunning and performant non-smart watch.\n\nLet's not even imagine what the third, \"Time Only\", option would turn my watch into. Perhaps, every time I needed to see time in my watch, I had to call Fossil customer care and then they would have either enabled the display for 10 seconds or just told me over the phone what I wanted to know from my watch!\n\nPerhaps, I am being harsh but I can't help it when I am coming from a perfectly fine smartwatch (Apple Watch) that won't work with Android phones, and you're just left to this.\n\nFossil, I urge you to work on the battery drainage and brightness things as the top-priority things to fix in this watch. Otherwise, you will just end up with customers like me who are not all happy with this purchase. I won't recommend this watch, at least not until Fossil fixed the battery issue at the minimum!",

                "review_body": "I used to have various Wear OS watches since the first release, and I see this Fossil Gen 5 as an absolute winner. Its design and quality far exceed all alternatives, both past and current. Initially, I hesitated to buy it for $300+ (its list price on the Fossil site) as I used Fossil Gen 3 Explorist and was mostly satisfied with it, but the Black Friday deal convinced me to give a try. And I never ever looked back and have hidden the Explorist immediately.\n\nThe watch is fast, charges very quickly (more on this below) and has all technologies that it has to (I see zero use in cellular connectivity in the watch, so its lack in Gen 5 doesn't hurt me). I have yet to test NFC as Google Pay doesn't work on watches in most of Europe (brain-dead idea to let it run on the phone and not on the watch), but this is not the watch's fault and I just need to find an alternative payment mechanism to test NFC properly.\n\nOn the bad side is a low time on battery. I do use heart monitoring every 15 minutes during the day and more frequently at night, and this causes the battery to stay for less than 24 hours. But you know what? Having a *fast* charger and a metal band solves this problem completely - I can easily take the watch off and put it back on, and charging it in twice a day for ~30 minutes in total is much less than charging my Gen 3 Explorist for over 2 hours once a day (and less than any other watch on the market, as I understand it).\n\nSo, I highly recommend this watch and wish that the vendor continues its great job in the future.",

It won't go two full days with this use but maybe a day and a half. There are modes to increase battery life if you need a longer stretch, and they're easy to select.\n\nDisplay is crisp and allows for small font to really add utility. Some flickering occurs with certain 3rd party faces in ambient mode; haven't had a chance to dive deeper on the actual cause. But it's rare and a different watchface won't have that issue.\n\nPerformance is great, apps open quickly, no delay while navigating the OS.\n\nThe only con I have is the bezel on the display leaves a blank, black border between the edge of the screen and the edge of the body of the watch. This is more pronounced with white display. The display is large enough, however, so this is more of an easthetic issue than a functional one\n\nOverall, great watch.

                "review_body": "I really wanted to love this watch, but it's just not quite there. I went from apple, to a pixel phone last year. I had the apple watch and it just worked so so well.... The watch was a seemless extension of your phone, and everything about it seemed natural. Pixel doesn't have a watch (yet?) But after a lot of review, this seemed like the best watch for me. I wanted good battery life, ability for two way communication (speaker and mic) run wearos well, at a decent price. While all of that is somewhat true, the execution just stuggles. Most of the time the watch runs well. I get notifications, I have used ok Google and I have answered phone calls. But it has been very noticable for the times any of those haven't worked.\n\nThe part that gets me the most is it will turn off Bluetooth without notice, for no reason. It's not exactly easy to turn it back on either. That of course Is a huge deal, no need to explain more there. I did fix it with a Bluetooth schedule feature, but I couldn't just leave it on, or else it would turn off.\n\nAnother annoying thing is the alarm. This issue is just poor software design (not sure if it's the os or fossil) but basically the watch alarm can function in two ways. One is solely managed on the watch, the other is an extended alarm from your phone. The phone alarm integration could be nice, but it's very very much not. When you turn an alarm on you phone, it will alarm on your phone and watch at the same time, and there is no turning this off. You can turn it down on the watch, but you can diffinitely still hear it. I would just do an alarm on my watch which is what the plan was, but the buttons do not snooze or have any function with the alarm. I wear glasses so the whole thing is just a pain, and I don't think there's any reason this should be an issue.\n\nAnother part is the call management. Right out of the box it did not work well. There was a software update needed and surprisingly enough that fixed a call quality issue. But it does not consistently answer on the watch when you press answer on the watch, and vice versa. At work I run Vonage. And I have my extension set up on my cellphone. However there is no way to direct a Vonage phone call to directly go to my phone rather than the watch. There's no way to manage this is Vonage, or in wearOS. I have unfortunaely had to disable the call feature completely because I almost never want to answer a work call on my watch\n\nAgain I really, really wanted to love it, but most of the reasons I got this watch are unreliable. I still use it, but unfortunately not to it's listed full potential",

I prefer my watches to feel like they are there, and this watch performs that decently.\n\nThe screen is responsive and I have had no issues with battery life as I don't use the watch as my only way of interacting with my phone, just an alternative in certain situations.\n\nMy biggest gripe is how cheap the watch materials feel. I understand at this price point I could get a very nice mechanical watch that feels like it was worth the price I paid. This watch, especially this metal band, feels like one wrong move and it is going to disintegrate. I also resized the band and the pins holding each link together felt very brittle. so I worry that if I use this band in any physical activity it will not last.\n\nOverall, inital impressions, I would rate this a 7/10.

I LOVE several features, mainly the \"easy voice recorder\" Its the only reason I haven't moved away from it.\nHowever, the small defects render this totally unusable.\n\n1) the power button gets jammed often.  When this happens the watch shuts down and usually will not power back up until you hook it to power.  This can happen quite easily: doing a push up, cutting onions.  Anything where your wrist is bent basically.  This will kick it into a cycle of reboots, or it just wont turn on (sometimes it wont even respond to the hard reset, pressing 2 buttons for 10 seconds).  You have to hook it to power.  I bought 3 more cables for my car, backpack etc just for this, but it shouldn't need it.\n\n- a simple fix would be to have the watch able to flip orientation, but i don't think there is a way to do this.\n\n2) the screen is not very responsive to touch.  I often have to press it 4 times to send a message after typing. I've tried variations of this, long presses, short taps, tapping dead center or not....still sucks\n\n3) voice to text works....sometimes.  It loads and loads, then doesn't work\n\n4) the watchband is trash.  I broke 2 in the first month before ordering a metal one, which is really uncomfortable, but it doesn't fall off my wrist while 20ft in the air (true story)\n\n5) bluetooth turns off a lot.  My research says this may be because I keep it in \"extended battery mode\".  But it wont get through a full work day if I don't.\n\nPros: the easy voice recorder is the single greatest feature of any product ever.  I push 1 button and talk into my wrist to save ideas.  My memory sucks, but this solves it....(but AGAIN...when it works).  It saves even when not tethered to phone.  The app is simple, i can dump the files to my computer to more easily step through them.\nyou can even record incriminating conversations or funny things your kids say, all very secretly.\n\nThe 1 push timer button is also great.\n\nThose feature have kept me on this for a year, but every 3 days I want to throw it at the wall.  It seems to be getting worse also.  More disconnections, less battery, turns off after a cool breeze kicks up.\n\nFix these things and you have an advocate for life.....",

I love this watch. It brought back the feeling I first had with my old Huawei. It does everything my old watch did only faster. And although I haven't used it for it's fitness tracking, I have used the ability to answer a call using just the watch. While some people have complained about that feature, I think it works great. People can't tell I'm using my watch and their voice is clear and loud enough. And initiating a call is just as easy as answering one.\nNotifications work flawlessly and am able to reply to text easily. The battery is great in that it's been 16 hours since it was charged and it's at 55%. That included having two conversations and having the brightness set to 3 out of five. I have found that the auto brightness is a little too dim for me so I don't use that option. Now, I am not monitoring my heart rate yet as that's not important to me right now, so I'm sure the battery will be a little lower with it on. It takes less than an hour to recharge and unlike my Huawei the charging contacts work every time. I got the metal band and it snaps easily without opening by itself.\nMy wife was so impressed with this watch that she also has the Gen 5, only the Rose Gold/Blush Julianna version. She wanted the Blush strap and as others have said it does tend to show, shall I say, a little darkening around the edges, but since other straps are available she's not worried.\nI am completely satisfied with this purchase and am looking forward to using the other features it is capable of, feeling they too will operate as good as any other smart watch.",

I was somewhat hesitant when I saw several reviews bashing the battery life, but as of this review, I've worn it daily for the last month with no problems.\n\nI work a typical 9-5, and by the end of the day, my watch is usually sitting at around 75%. This is with the standard battery mode enabled, and with many features (fitness tracker/GPS/etc) enabled.\nThe Fossil gen 5 comes with Wear OS, and as someone who transitioned from Tizen previously, I couldn't be happier. I do wish Google would come through with some major updates, but for now, it functions as it should.\n\nThe screen is great if you're looking for a bright display with a great pixel density. While the bezel doesn't rotate, the spinning crown is comfortable for anything I have to work with. The Snapdragon Wear 3100 SoC makes the performance a  breeze despite being a little aged and performance seems to be on par with even the most loaded watches (such as the Skagen Falster 3)\n\nThe watch also has 8GB of onboard memory, so if you're a person who often has their watch away from their phone this should be a great perk for you. The fitness tracker seems to be very accurate as well, however, I'm not a fitness expert and have only ever used the built-in trackers from previous smartwatches.\n\nOverall, the watch is a great value.

My previous watch was a Samsung Gear S3, and so the bar was already high.\n\nThis watch remains faithful to the Wear OS ecosystem, and by that I mean it uses the stock software provided by Google faithfully. This is a double edge sword. The Google Assistant on the watch will not send text messages to contacts - it encounters an error with the phone everytime. I got around this by going into the messages app on the watch and then replying to a message using the microphone. Another issue is that I cannot switch to calls on the watch when I initially took the call on the phone; it works if you answer a call on the watch, but not switching during a call. Another major issue is that the battery gets obliterated if you're playing music on your phone and the music controls display on the watch. Even if you don't touch the watch, the fact that it gets the music data in the controls drains the battery horribly... HORRIBLY.\n\nLearning how to maximize the various battery modes has been imperative with this watch - you have to know when to switch to which mode if you hope to make it through the day without having to take it off and charge it.\n\nI switched to this watch because it was supposed to be a flagship in representing the Wear OS. Let me tell you, if this is as good as Wear OS gets, then Wear OS sucks. If my Samsung Gear S3 wouldn't have become painfully slow from all of the software updates from Samsung, I would probably still use it today. But, Samsung messed that watch up by trying to keep it current with the watches in their showcase despite the hardware not being able to keep up. Also, I bought a new phone that's not a Samsung and don't want to bloat my phone with the Samsung stuff needed for that watch to work.\n\nNote: the charging mechanism for this watch is very touchy. It will repeatedly beep like it's been just placed on the charger... REPEATEDLY. Rubbing off the contacts from any sweat residue makes little to no difference. Do not charge your watch at night because it just might prevent you from sleeping with this annoyance. Who engineered this?!\n\nAll in all, this watch is a \"meh\" for me, and even that is being generous. I've had better, and it was Samsung when they don't cripple the watch with software updates that the hardware can't keep up with. Yes, some of the issues are out of Fossil's control, but they still are accountable for quality assurance. The battery drain, the charging mechanism, and being aware of the power modes is what ruins the experience the most.",

The Fossil Gen 5 Carlyle in a gunmetal grey metal band addresses and in every one of the above specifications, is noticeably better, allows you to take or make a call and talk on the watch, is more responsive with larger memory and storage and (with some tweaking of the settings over the first few days) now has been consistently providing me with a 7:00AM- 11:00PM day with 25-35% battery life remaining.

Get Bent, not sure why but something tells me scratches are a valid excuse to void the non-warranty... atleast that's what most companies do, cough cough motorola/samsung/lg cough, so yea I'm not going through the warranty trash for it to be blamed on me using superficial reasoning, don't y'all know a scratched screen can cause batteries to not take a charge or even...explode??, with that said your results may very, this one never lost its glass, or buttons, or charging strips(until 12/4/22), it didn't explode(yet), the screen and glass are in solid condition, scratching is normal, maybe grab a clear case and screen protector, but to be fair 8months with only scratching, that isn't to bad, I feel it could have made it 2 yrs, if it felt like it, I guess, the oled was sharp enough, battery life could improve like by 50%, js, but here's what really annoys me.  no more software updates, because of this I won't buy from fossil again, this is my first smart watch I've ever owned, won't wast my money again, sure it wasn't but $250+ doll hairs, but for only 8 months of life, idk. Again here are the positives, the oled is solid, glass is solid, sound could be louder but good enough, the battery could be better but does the job, I never dropped or placed in water, so why die with 54% battery???????\n\n************UPDATE************\nSo 48hours later she poped on all willy-nilly like acting all normal like and s***..... you know just like it never happened... probably fits a warranty repair, but you know fossil doesn't  provide a useful warranty, almost like they don't stand behind their products or care about their customer's, don't believe me see attached picture.\n************UPDATE2***********\nWell didn't even make it 2 years, so the charging strips are falling off now and the battery heats up while in time only mode, which is the lowest power consumption mode the watch has, Every 30 to 45 days this watch requires a reset to factory settings, with this being my experience over 2 yrs I will not be purchasing another fossil product, my next watch will be a samsung galaxy watch 5 pro.",

I've changed my overall rating to reflect that their customer service did the fair thing in the end since the watch malfunction wasn't my fault and I allowed them twice to repair it. It is a great watch when it worked and I would recommend it in that context.\n\nMy watch keeps rebooting requiring a reset which only stops the issue temporarily. I sent it in for warranty service twice and it still is not fixed. I contacted Fossil a third time requesting a replacement because I really like the watch when it works. THEIR reponse is it is now out of warranty and I AM responsible for any costs incurred for repair for this existing issue that never was fixed under warranty (so no replacement obviously).

                "review_body": "I previously had a Garmin Fenix 3 HR but wasn't using most the functionality on it and wanted a more attractive everyday watch.  Based on reviews, I settled on the Fossil Carlyle Gen 5.\n\nWhat a difference. Instead of being clunky and slow and quite ugly, it's fast and smooth and beautiful with a great feel and screen.\n\nThe OS is smooth and easy to use, but boy do you pay for it in battery life.  Out of the box this thing was burning through maybe 1% every few minutes, just by being on my wrist doing nothing.\n When I started interacting with it to explore it the battery was going down even faster, maybe 10% in 10 minutes.\n\nI read of many similar complaints and there are Reddit threads discussing how to get reasonable battery life from it. In the end I used the custom battery mode option where I disabled pretty much everything apart from Bluetooth and always on screen and the things you can't turn off like heart rate; no location, wifi, tilt to wake , NFC, ok Google etc.  I didn't want most of those anyway.\n\nWow. What a difference. Now I make it home after a full day at work (maybe 12h) with 60+% battery remaining.  I charge twice a day, whilst I shower in the morning, and half an hour or so before bed. Bi use sleep as Android for sleep movement and heart rate tracking with the watch and that similarly uses ~40% battery overnight.\n\nMostly I use the watch for the time and controlling music; I have all but a few notifications turned off, so in truth other than heartrate monitoring it doesn't do much \"smart\", so from that perspective the battery life is dreadful, but it gets me through a day of regular usage which is acceptable.\n\nIf you think you're going to track hikes or navigate via gps from it, or spend hours playing around with it, don't buy.  You'll be disappointed. I'm keeping my Garmin for outdoor use and using this for daily wear.\n\nFossil, change your default battery mode; I nearly returned this it was SO BAD out of the box.

Being able to have a voice command on my wrist to set timers for work, play music, check messages and take calls is great. The little speaker on there isn't bad and the mic picks up commands well too. My favorite low key feature is when I'm playing music on my phone to my portable speaker I can leave both on the charger and literally adjust the volume with the dial on the watch and tap to change songs!\n\nIt also houses a small amount of apps from the Google play store that have a few time passing games as well. Also, if you have picture text messages on your phone they'll display on this watch as well.\n\nGoogle fit enabled so the heart rate and exercise info syncs with the phone and scale in the restroom. I also like the theater mode to have it hush and dim while watching movies. Lastly to end my rambling, asking google to find my phone from this watch has saved me so much time since I tend to actually misplace my phone around the house.\n\nGreat impression and I don't see myself replacing it for a very long time at this rate.",

                "review_body": "I got this watch in January 2021 after my Galaxy S2 died, and it seemed ok. I specifically wanted Google Assistant, heart rate monitoring, and notifications from my phone--and it delivered on all of those. A few things seemed lacking, and I got the opportunity to try the Fitbit Versa 3--which revealed how bad this watch really is. Here are my findings as of August 2021:\n\nBattery life. The Fossil Gen 5 originally lasted 1.5-2 days, in less than 4 months it started going into battery saving mode by 7pm. I charge it every night, so it's definitely not able to do sleep tracking during that time. I was accustomed to charging my Galaxy S2 every night, even though it would last 2-3 days on a charge, so that wasn't a big deal--until I got the Fitbit V3. The Fitbit's charge has only dropped ~10% per day (full day with sleep tracking all night) and charges 9% during a quick shower after my morning workout. There is absolutely no comparison.\n\nAlarms. I spent hours trying to get my phone alarms to stop duplicating on the watch. My options were to disconnect from the watch every evening, endure duplicate alarms from my phone and watch every morning, or let it charge in the other room. I opted to let it charge in my office.\n\nVoice Assistant. The voice assistant technically works, but I would find myself repeating the same commands 3-4 times slowly before it would take. I assumed this was the cost of having a mic inside a watch, but my Fitbit V3 has no difficulty hearing me the first time--every time.\n\nHeart Rate Monitoring. It has a heart rate monitor, and it will check occasionally--or when explicitly told to. I assumed that's what the heart rate monitor was supposed to do, but the Fitbit V3 actually increases the sampling rate when I'm exercising and reads far more often--giving me much more confidence in the data.\n\nButtons. When I do pushups, the button on the Fossil does a long-press on my wrist and sometimes the button sticks--requiring me to pull it back out. It's only 7 months old!\n\nNotifications. It did notifications just fine, but so does the Fitbit V3.\n\nA few months ago, friend of mine wanted to get a smartwatch and asked me if I'd recommend my watch. At the time, I said, \"It depends on what you want the watch for. This watch is optimized for the things I'm using it for, but I can't recommend it for general use.\" Now I can confidently say, no. I don't recommend it. Get a Fitbit Versa 3 or something that's even on the same playing field.",

It is a nice size (I am not a big person), and I like that I can easly put any 22mm band on it.  Also, the display is crisp and bright. It even squeeks by in bright sun.\n\nOn the other side, the battery and battery management are marginal. There are four battery profiles.  The default profile, named \"daily\" won't get me through a typical day without an afternoon top-up.  Two other profiles, \"extended\" and \"time only\", turn off the \"always on display\", which is unacceptable to me.  That leaves the \"custom\" display. I use it with the display & bluetooth on, location (gps and compass) on or off as I need them, and just about everything else off.  This gets me through a day with some power to spare. But I have to pay attention.  I'm also not convinced, based on watching the battery drain, that the software is telling me everything about what battery things are on or off.  I find it necessary to \"re-assert\" the custom profile every so often.\n\nOverall I like this watch, but I think we have a ways to go before smart watches are more than a tech toy.",

                "review_body": "Update 12/1/2023:\n----------------------\nThe watch finally died abruptly while wearing last night. It was 90% charge as I took it out of the charger a little while ago. Went cold dead. After the original review below, I managed the settings such that with most connectivities off it would last full day. So I was okay and I bought a couple of dozens of watch faces and used to change them often. Also bought additional charging stands chargers and bands. Down the drain. They are not super expensive. But they are all pile of garbage now at home all of a sudden.\n\nOriginal Review:\n-------------------\nI have seen smart watches on other people for years and stuck to my old fashioned Seiko analog. Finally, I bought this one after looking around reviews and comparison. Apple watch wasn't an option for me. We have dozens of Android but no Apple devices.\n\nNow, the watch does work per spec. That wasn't the reason for my lower than 5 ?? rating. I rated for what value I derive and satisfaction with the use.\n\n1. The watch is bulkier than my old fashioned watch. Not very aesthetically pleasing. Although, this looked better/sober among various models. This is minor. I don't dislike it, at the same time not overly enthusiastic to wear it.\n\n2. It took some time to understand the quirks of how this watch behaves for the first time. This is not a complaint. Being a techie, I pick up fairly quickly.\n\n3. Google Pay on the watch requires screen lock for security. The logic is understandable, but ridiculous for a watch to be unlocked frequently. Google has to find a way to drive security from phone to watch differently. Don't know how. But there must be a user friendly option. This is just bizarre.\n\n4. Watch screen. This is the problematic part. Apparently, the watch makers can only squeeze in so much battery power. Hence, there is a whole bunch of ways they try to save power so that it lasts for a day's use. And as a result, their automatic screen brightness is pathetic. You can barely see it.\n\n5. Watch faces. The initial euphoria of being able to change faces wears out very quickly when you realize that there are very few useful faces delivered with the watch. The list of faces are plain ridiculous and cartoonish to my taste. May be good for others. I like clean faces with analog clock and digital info snippets. Found only one I could use. Then I started scavenging the app store. Because, they advertise that they got tens of thousands! Well, after I kept paying, I realized that not all are compatible to my watch. And finally, I realized that the sane way to look for new watch faces is to stick to the included apps in the watch suggested list within the app store inside the watch. Install others on phone and hope to use on phone will often cause a huge waste of time and money with suboptimal experience.\n\n6. Battery life is the deal breaker. Does not last even half-day.\n\nAll in all, I am not just saying what is right or wrong with this watch, but the overall experience.",

However after changing features, the watch changes the mode without telling you and then you screwed.\n2) At first i tried using both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi mode and the battery would drain in just couple hours\n3) I then disabled WiFi, as the phone suggested and tried using only with Bluetooth.\nUsing with built-in watch faces, the phone would last at most half a day.\n\nOnce smartwatch goes below 30% it stops being a smart-watch and goes into extended mode, which is good if you are away from home and want to extend your battery life, but for any normal person who wants to use smart features, this is useless.\n4) There are about 50 watch faces, but only 1 has seconds, which don't show up in the DIm mode.\nThe Facer App is great and it has nice watch faces and my own Design2 has seconds, but Facer restricts seconds in DIM mode as they say to save on battery life.\n5) Using a Walk Mode to count steps with GPS turned on for 20 minutes, drained 10-15% of battery life.\nIf I don't want the GPS being turned on, then a valid question why do i need to pay $170 for the feature which i am afraid to use so that battery won't drain?!!\n6) Another test of Bluetooth and Wifi and I lost 25% in 2 hours with watches only being in the dim mode. Comparing side-by-side with my old Sony Smartwatch3 which is still at 91% vs this new cool watch at 75% is making me nervous.\nShould I know bring additional charger with me and check the battery life every half an hour?\nThat's not what i want.\nI saw in other reviews that people were able to get thru the whole day, but in my opinion it is possible only in the extended mode, without any connection to the phone.\nSo yes, if you only want to count steps and check your BPM, this watches will probably last a full day.\nBut if you want to check text messages and emails and do even anything in the non-dim mode, the battery will drain on your eyes.\nThe last few days before returning the watches i tried only using them for basic needs and the watches hardly lasted for 8 hours.\nMy needs are 15 hours a day and the watch can't handle it.\nVery unfortunate, because the watch is very nice looking with nice interface but not for the needs of an active person who needs them for more than 8 hours.",

I give great praises to this watch and would recommend it to anyone looking for a well rounded fully featured watch without the need for mobile calls, texts, etc. independent of having their phone on or near them.\n\nThat said there are only two minor issues I have with the watch.  First is battery life with all the features enabled. (This is a common issue with smartwatches.)  The watch will last just about a full day.  I suspect that over the two to three years of expected use that the battery will degrade to the point where it works for about a half a day.  I have had this happen with my previous smartwatches and it ended up restricting usage to the point where I rarely wore it.  The other issue war that I experienced an instance of disablement.  This was fixed with a reboot of the watch by pressing down on the crown (main button) for about 10-15 seconds until it vibrated, while it was charging on the charger.\n\nAgain, this watch is great.  I highly recommend it if you want a smartwatch with these features in 2020.  It's arguably the best Android Wear watch for value as of this writing.  I just have a hard time giving any \"smartwatch\" that's out there today a 5 star rating as the tech used in these devices isn't quite mature enough yet to grant one yet.",

My first watch was the Fitbit Luxe (technically more of a fitness watch) and it had very little features, the app was garbage, and that fitness tracking wasn't that great which is the reason why I bought it. So I sent it back and bought the Gen 5 Carlyle.\n\nPros:\n- Uses Wear OS so you have access to a bunch of great apps\n- Completely waterproof (the Fitbit had to be out into \"water lock\" if you wanted it to be waterproof)\n- Pretty responsive once I de-cluttered it and got rid of some bloat ware\n- Can reassign the hardware buttons to go to whatever app you want\n- Layout is relatively easy to use\n\nCons:\n- Really really really bad battery life. If I use it normally throughout the day it's usually needs charged around the afternoon which sucks\n- Heart rate monitor sucks. Have to have it in the perfect position on your wrist in order for it to work which means it's probably not gonna track your HR while you work out.\n- Notifications show up in the notification center but I don't get actually notified with vibration or a tone most of the time. Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't\n\nConclusion:\nIf you can get it at a discounted price I think it's a great BUDGET option. There's a new generation for these watches but from what I've heard not much have changed unfortunately. It's better than the Fitbit Luxe by A LOT though.

From there I go to school/work all day. Depending on the day, and how much time I charge it before I leave, it lasts until some time after 5pm. Basically I have to charge it once or twice a day most days - sometimes when I get home, and always before bed. That's the story of the awful battery.\n\nBesides the awful battery this watch does everything. I've gotten many compliments on the Google Pay functionality. That and the notifications are my favorite parts. The knob for scrolling feels very nice, as do the other two buttons. Can't really say anything bad about the watch.\n\nWearOS could use some work however, maybe some optimization to help with the battery life, but mostly just app support. I use Textra for texting, but Textra doesn't support WearOS, so if I want to text from my watch I have to change apps, which I'm not willing to do. For now, I can just reply to messages through notifications. It also seems like I should be able to open apps on my phone from all notifications, not just certain ones. At least I can be pretty certain that I will receive future updates, as the watch is cutting edge right now.\n\nOverall, this thing is awesome. Using it feels like something out of a sci-fi film. Would absolutely buy again.",

To get a day or 2 out of this watch certain features need to be checked and turned of. The heart rate sensor has pulsing green lights. When you 1st get this these are constantly taking a reading also killing the battery.\nA) You have to turn the Heart-rate sensor Always-on setting OFF in Google Fit.

I have received multiple complements when wearing it as it actually looks like a watch not some mini computer on your arm.\nFossil has been great with updates when I first opened the watch and set it up I had to update it a few times and it took a while but that just shows that fossil is keeping up support.\nThe battery life could be better. I wear it to work and I do 10-13 hour shifts by the time I hit 8-9 hours the watch is already is battery saver mode so I have to charge it every night. But it hasn\u2019t died on me during a shift yet.\nMy only complaint is that when I switched to iPhone this watch caused a lot of issues with the iPhone. When it worked what it could do was limited but it was still usable. Most of the time I was having issues because it would disconnect from Bluetooth and wouldn\u2019t want to reconnect this would also cause other Bluetooth devices to have issues connecting. I would have to turn Bluetooth off and on and forget the devices and re connect them. Most of the time that would work but sometimes I would have to restart the phone. I stopped using the watch.\nGreat smart watch for android horrible issues with iPhone.",

More is better but a watch must meet this minimum standard. This watch manages that and a little more, especially if I keep app usage to a minimum.\n\nI demand two things from a smartwatch: the time and discreet notifications for messages, emails, and calls on my phone. Weather at a glance is nice, too. I don't want to use my watch as a speakerphone or music player and I certainly don't want to have it giving me constant turn by turn prompts from Google Maps. Heart rate and step tracking are useful but I haven't worn a watch while sleeping since I was in the Army three decades ago so sleep tracking is lost on me.\n\nIn terms of capabilities, this watch is overkill for me but it looks nice and the Prime Day price was too good to pass up. My only major gripe is the dangerously exposed glass bezel. It sits up above the body of the watch and is easily cracked (this is not my first Carlyle HR). I strongly recommend a TPU or silicone cover/bumper to protect the glass.\n\nAll in all, it is a good replacement for my LG G Watch R, which died after several years of rugged and reliable service",

It's sleep tracking and heart monitoring abilities are fantastic and I, someone who has only ever worn pajamas to bed, have been able to sleep with it on with zero issue. Battery life is a drain for me because I like to use all the features but, if you turn all that off you could definitely get two-days use. I'm excited to potentially take this camping and be able to leave the phone in the car!\n\nIt's sleek design is handsome out of the box, and it's beauty is only slightly hidden by the plastic \"suit of armor\" case i bought for it. I don't know how resistant the screen is to scratches and cracks and I'm not keen to find out, but the touch screen has no issue with a screen cover. Just take the cover off if you have to hop on a video call or take a selfie!\n\nMy last thoughts are that I wouldn't expect much in terms of quantity of apps. If you don't care about health tracking, or the watch's functionality, and are only interested in new apps, I wouldn't have FOMO if you don't have a Smartwatch, and would advise you wait a couple more years for more apps to enter the market.",

Support (does it exist?) is not responsive. Now a bit about pros and cons.\nAdvantages:\n- nice looking. It is very subjective of course, but it is one of the best looking smart watches (for my taste)\n- durable. By coincidence I was hitting or scratching different surfaces by this watch, they kept it well, screen is still like new\n- fast charge. Comparing to Galaxy Active 2 this charges are least twice as fast\n- different battery modes. One can easily switch between them and chose high performance or saving battery\n\nOk things:\n- battery life. Improved from gen 4 and similar to other rivals\n- there are some apps. Not too many, but some are useful\n\nDisadvantages:\n- Bluetooth connection. It sucks. Sometimes they are connected, sometimes they disconnect. When you try to switch it back, it is not enough (like manual says) just to tap on Bluetooth connection and then phone. Instead one has to switch off and on Bluetooth, sometimes several times. Sometimes you have to open app on phone and then it connects.\n- no sleep tracking. They (producers) can\u2019t make sleep tracking!!! 20$ watch have it but this don\u2019t!\n- GPS sucks. One of the main purposes I bought this watch was to be able to run without phone. This is almost impossible. If you are lucky GPS will connect after 15 minutes, if not - never without your phone, only when you are home and connected to a cell phone.\n- APP on a phone. Piece of crap. Connection is not stable. Integration between watch and phone is weird - you update, it says it is updated, but steps count on watch and phone are different. Activities can upload for more than a day, although app says it is synced, what the hack?\n\nAs a conclusion. I\u2019d you like style and look of this watch and do not plan to use it for lots of sport activities - take them, you most probably will be very happy. If you like to use it for sports, sleep tracking - consider another model.\n\nPs. I use them with my IPhone. Maybe Android would allow more, but Apple doesn\u2019t allow much :(\nUnfortunately I hate Apple Watch and it is problematic to find watches supported by iOS.",

I never had a SIM card in the LG so battery life was never an issue with the larger battery it had.\nI only upgraded mainly for 2 reasons, first the microphone died, and second the watch band was breaking. I purchased the LG \"refurbished\" for $100 and was really happy with it, but since the mic was bad and it was going to cost around$75 for a replacement band it was time to upgrade.\n\nThe LG was purchased to replace the original Moto 360 I bought used because the battery was failing again. The original lasted over a year for me, the replacement fell just shy of a year. Plus it was an upgrad adding a speaker and the ability to use Google pay on the watch.\n\nI wear this watch daily and usually have at least 10% battery life left when I put it in the charger at night. Battery life in I  a custom mode with everything turned on except Ok Google detection.\n\nThis watch so far is just superior to both of my previous smart-watches. My only apprehension buying was to he smaller battery capacity compared to what it replaced. However this makes the watch thinner on my wrist, and for me the size is great! I love that I can use any 22mm standard band on it and change it out easily. That was a big downfall of both of it's predecessors for me requiring special bands.\n\nI am by no means a heavy user of the watch. I have been wearing a watch for about 30 years now, I never could adjust to just using my phone.\nThis for me as an automotive technician is great because I don't have to take my gloves off or get grease all over my phone just to see who is calling or texting at that moment. For me the smart-watches are an extension of the phone, and it's great for getting notifications without having to keep the phone in my pocket.",

                "review_body": "Three weeks ago I purchased 2 highly rated Wear OS watches, the Fossil Gen 5 Carlyle and a Ticwatch Pro 4G LTE (to be paired with my Pixel phone). The Fossil was intended to be my daily driver, worn to my full time job as a teacher and also going on volunteer Fire/EMS calls during my work days. As an EMT there's one feature of this watch's 3100 chipset that I particularly like: you can get watch faces that have a moving sweep second hand even when the always on display is asleep or dimmed. This is something most smartwatches can't do and it's really important for taking patients' vital signs.\n\nOverall, I really like this watch. It's essentially my \"dress\" watch, as opposed to the larger Ticwatch Pro. The Fossil is relatively thin and looks good on my small-ish wrist. The included silicon band isn't great, though. It's a dust/ lint magnet. My use case is mostly for notifications. I don't use the activity tracker features much, other than the step counter and rarely the heart rate sensor. I do have the always on screen enabled as well as the lift to wake option, but not NFC. With those settings I usually end a16 hour day with about 33% battery left. I don't use sleep tracking and I charge it every night.\n\nThe Fossil's swim rating makes me comfortable wearing it in wet environments. I am a bit concerned about screen protection, though. The glass is not protected by a bezel and it's apparently not Gorilla Glass, either. Fossil told me it's \"alkali-aluminosilicate sheet glass commonly used in conumer electronics.\" That's what Gorilla Glass is, so this may be a competing company's product?\n\nThere is a software glitch with this watch. There's an option to turn on Do Not Disturb when the watch is off your wrist. This does work. However, it doesn't turn Do Not Disturb off when you put the watch back on, so you miss notifications. I just turned this option off.\n\nIn conclusion, the Fossil Gen 5 is a stylish smartwatch that will easily get you through the day with light/moderate use and the added benefit of always having a sweep second hand visible if you need that for healthcare or some other reason.

                "review_body": "One of the main things I was concerned about getting a Wear OS watch was batter life. So many reviewers of so many models complained that their watch would last the day. I use the custom settings to save on battery life, with a few things I don't need like GPS and always on display turned off. I do have NFC and the heart rate monitor turned on. The watch easily lasts the day. I put it on the charger at night while getting ready for bed, and it charges quickly, so I usually pull if off the charger at 90% to extend the battery's life. Even only charging to 90% and leaving it all night, it easily lasts the next day.\n\nI love the customizable buttons. I have the top one set to Google Pay, so paying for things is super quick and easy -- no scrolling through apps to get into Google Pay. The bottom button takes me straight to my workout timer.\n\nBefore getting this, I hadn't worn a watch for years, since my phone can give me the time, and I preferred not having a bulky thing strapped to my wrist. This watch is thin enough that it doesn't bug me.\n\nThe band was probably nicer than most, but I replaced it anyway (with a magnetic closure metal mesh one, which adjusts to literally any size and breathes well while working out.) One thing I love about both the original and replacement bands is that no tools are required to remove or install them. So you can get multiple bands and switch between them to match whatever occasion.\n\nThe OS has been extremely stable. This morning was the first time I ever had to restart it in a month and half. (It was showing the time, but not unlocking for some reason.)\n\nI love that the watch face is customizable. I actually created my own face in Facer with my company logo and a nice clean design with just the elements I want on it.\n\nFinally, before getting a smart watch, I was a little skeptical about how much more convenient it would be to check messages and the time on a watch vs. a phone. I am no longer skeptical. It is so convenient.",

This watch is round.\n\nI have to say, I love the style of this watch--it's genuine Fossil, and looks sharp.  I had to go with the leather band (whose dark brown color goes surprisingly well with the black watch), but I am looking at buying the steel watchband for it since I find those more comfortable.  I also own an LG G Watch R in rose gold that looks nice, but the hardware is a few years old now and it's not as snappy as it used to be.  But, it is still more than capable.  The Fossil is a nice change, and the black case is a nice alternative to the LG!\n\nWhat I like?  The buttons on the side do something, even the \"stem\" that can be rotated in one direction for notifications and in the other for settings.  And as I said, the style of it is high quality without looking pretentious (and it's not a ridiculous \"rounded square\").  There are plenty of Fossil-designed watch faces that can be installed and customized.  (I like using Facer, but their app has gotten bloated and drags down the OS on any watch I have tried it on.)  Apps are snappy.  I don't use the voice features, but it's interesting that is now has a tiny speaker.\n\nWhat I don't like?  Battery life is not good.  Unless I need to use this a lot more to somehow \"calibrate\" the battery and the OS, I can't see this lasting throughout a day.  Although I admit that I was playing with the watch quite a bit right after I got it.  Still, after 20-30 minutes, I don't expect battery life to have dipped into the sub-90% range.  Also, the charging pad is rather small.  The LG has a nice, large magnetic base that it sits within.  This is just a small magnetic charging pad that the Fossil perches on top of.\n\nIt's a keeper, though! I'm glad I purchased this one on sale, and am looking forward to receiving the steel watch band for it.",

                "review_body": "So I have been looking for a good Android alternative.  Decided to take a chance on the Fossil after considering it with the Armani 3.  Now I exercise daily, walking and every 4 days add 30 - 40 minutes of weightlifting.  I also own a Series 5 Watch and a couple of Garmins and never have a problem getting all day from Apple or multiple days with Garmin.  So the first day with Fossil I put it on at 6:30AM.  Lifted weights first for 34 minutes then went out for a 4.2 mile walk.  When I finished the walk I noticed the battery life was down to 57%.  So I went in to notifications and turned off everything but two.  Left the AOD on (can only dumb it down so much).  At 2:30 PM the watch was completely dead.  Put it on the charger for the rest of the day.  Day two I went in and customized the battery settings and turned off as much as I could.  Put it back on the charger to get it back to 100% before walking.  So back on the wrist at 6:45am, 5 minute drive to where I was walking.  Did a 5.4 mile walk, just under 90 minutes.  Checked the battery again  and noticed the watch was down to 53%.  Day two actually lasted a little longer.  Watch completely shutdown at 4:15 PM.  So I wanted to see how it would do with music and exercise so I added a Playlist and setup my Jaybird Vistas on the watch for day three.  Day 3 made sure battery was at 100% before the short drive for my walk and put it on at 6:50AM.  Day 3 walked 4.5 miles 78 minutes with music and GPS.  Checked the battery at the end which was down to 41%.  Watch was completely drained at11:50AM.  I could probably go into settings and make some changes to probably extend this for a couple of hours, but it seems kind of pointless because now I have a Smartwatch not doing anything.  Short battery life seems to be kind of common with Android watches right now.  I am not really sure if this is due to Wear OS not being optimized yet or if it is the hardware that vendors are using.  So all day for me would typically be from around 5:00AM to 10:00PM at night. Even if I could get the Fossil to the Evening hours I would consider keeping it, but routinely completely dead in the afternoon has me returning this.  Really hoping that Google takes the Smartwatch business seriously this year and comes out with something nice.",

I keep the app open in the background, but it still loses sync multiple times throughout the day and I have to turn bluetooth off on the watch and back on before it finally syncs back up.  And you have to sync it with the app and the phone, so you'll see 2 entries of the watch connected in your bluetooth settings.  If you don't sync it with the phone also, you don't get notifications and stuff.  I never could get the heart rate monitor working.  Features seem to be not supported on iOS.  So I do not recommend this for iPhone.\n\nHowever, I gave it to my wife to try on her Android and it worked great for her.  Kept track of her steps, heart rate, sleep... everything I wanted the watch to do worked for her.  The watch itself is gorgeous, the screen is great, the band is a soft rubber that feels good on the wrist (I also got a metal band to swap out when I want to look fancy).  I really loved this watch and wished it would have worked on my iPhone better.  That's not entirely Fossil and WearOS's fault.  Apple purposefully locks down their stuff to make it as hard on 3rd party companies to offer quality products that work on iOS as possible so users are forced to buy Apple products, as I have been forced to buy an Apple Watch instead in order to get full functionality with my iPhone.  If you have Android, I can't recommend this watch enough.  If you have Apple, try elsewhere.",

                "review_body": "Pros:\n- Great battery life. My screen is not always on, only wakes up when I tilt the watch. This way I can easily get 1.5-2 days per charging.\n- Nice look and feel. Not too big. The leather bands give it a really nice look. Received many compliments that it looks nice and is similar to a real watch.\n- Really good screen size and resolution. The pictures in IMs, search results, etc. are very detailed and useful even on such a small screen.\n- Very good synchronization with the phone. The alerts appear on the phone and watch almost the same time. The dismissed notifications also disappear on the phone.\n- A lot of good apps\n\nCons:\n- The touchscreen is very fragile. I scratched it on the second day of wearing it. It's really frustrating, because I was wearing a smart fitness watch for the past 4 years, which never got sratched. So beware: get a protective foil, glass or case over the screen.\n- Charging is very difficult. The charging pad snaps to the back of the clock, but 9 times out of 10 it doesn't start charging. Most days I need to fiddle with it for 5-10 minutes until it finally starts to charge. Even then, sometimes it stops charging around 80%.\n- The big middle button sticks out and I always accidentally long press it, starting the Google Assistant voice command recognition. Sometimes I press even longer and accidentally switch off the clock (e.g.: during exercising).\n- The system sounds/chimes are very poor quality. For example, the notification of the start of charging, or when an alarm goee off, the watch sounds like a mobile phone from the 90's. Definitely not like a nice smart watch like this should sound. This is probably the fault of WearOS and could be customized, but would be nice to have it out of the box.\n- Sleep tracker is not included by default.\n\nConclusion:\nI'm using it for a bit less than a month and am really happy with the watch.\nMy wife has a series 3 Apple watch and this Fossil watch seems to be at the same level in speed and functionality. The Fossil's battery life seems to be a lot better. I also think that this watch can display more text on its screen than the series 3 Apple watch.\nSo if you can live with the cons listed above, I definitely recommend purchasing it.",

This went on sale significantly cheaper so is it a good smartwatch?  Yes it is.\n\nThe Positive: The screen has excellent fidelity.  It's the most clearly handsome smartwatch.\nTheir is no real lag in the apps which was a frequent complaint on wear os devices.  Replying to messages sent via different apps via voice or text on the watch is nice.\n\nThe Bad:  Wear OS has a very small catalog of apps.  Battery in extended mode only lasts a day and a half of moderate use.  Regular mode is good for about a day.  While in extended apps like the weather don't function.  You would just use it to check and reply to various notifications and check time.\n\nNote: If you don't normally wear a watch and we're looking at getting the metal banded version be aware you will most likely need to take links out and buy one of those hammer and push pin kits to take out the links. They run around 12 bucks on Amazon.\n\nPrior to buying this I was curious how this or even if this would work with my companies work profile on my phone.  There isn't much data on this on the internet.  My company chose not to approve the wear os app on their profile so some options are limited.  The Microsoft Teams app notifications that pop up when people message you do pop up on the watch.  You can respond to those messages with voice to text responses.  I was pretty pleased in at least that win. You will not be able to sync the companies calendar appointments etc though.  Hope that helps.\n\nOverall I like the watch.  I do find myself wishing it had some of the features (for batteries sake) of the newest ticwatch but do enjoy the look of this one more.",

I find myself banging it against door frames and other things pretty often, and it has no damage.\n\nIt's actually waterproof. I've taken it swimming, and have taken it about 12ft deep in water, and never had any issues. The water did not activate the touchscreen, and the dials and buttons worked fine.\n\nThe battery life is a bit disappointing. You need to pick and choose which settings you want on in order to have the watch last throughout the entire day. My biggest suggestion is to turn off any gesture controls, because they get accidentally activated so often that it kills your battery life.\n\nWearOS is the biggest problem with the watch. It's kinda buggy, the menus are annoying to go through, and the settings are lacking.\n\nFor watch faces, I suggest finding an app that you can design your own, or download other custom made faces. I use Facer to make my own digital watchface.\n\nNotifications come in at the same time as your phone. There isn't any delay between your phone vibrating and your watch vibrating.\n\nHowever, sometimes the watch will disconnect from Bluetooth for no reason. It's not often, maybe once a month or so, but it's happened enough that I can bring it up in this review.\n\nAlso the brightness settings are absolutely trash. You have the option of 1 through 5, 1 being the dimmest, 5 being the brightest, but unless you're only using the watch at night, you need to keep it on the brightest setting at all times. I also find it really hard to see in direct sunlight.\n\nAlso to note: replace the watch strap it comes with. If you get sweaty, it starts to stink really bad.",

But that happens with my car and phone too so maybe it's my phone. Huh. (EDIT - changed it to five stars because it turns out it WAS my phone that was losing sync and not the watch.) Well anyways yeah I never thought smartwatches made any sense whatsoever, especially not at $300+. But then this bad boy went on sale for under $210 and I am one of those people who always misses phone calls, txts, and emails because I lay my phone down and forget about it. Yeah my life does not revolve around a phone. But with the coronavirus lockdown I needed to be instantly reachable for work since I'm working from home right now. Yet I hate carrying my phone around when I'm at home. So a small device that I can wear on my person that instantly lets me know when someone is trying to reach me AND i can txt and take phone calls on it?! PERFECT.\n\nAnd this bad boy IS perfect. Although when doing my research I kept reading how Samsung watches have so much better battery life, what Samsung watches *don't* have is Google assistant. And Samsung's speech-to-text is HORRIBLE. My wife's Note 9 cannot understand what I'm saying u-n-l-e-s-s I t-a-l-k s-l-o-w l-i-k-e I h-a-v-e s-p-e-c-i-a-l n-e-e-d-s, but my Huawei Mate SE *perfectly* translates my everyday speech to text - even when i've got loud music playing. And since I'm not trying to type on a tiny 1\" screen, that only leaves me the option of buying a watch whose speech-to-text actually works or else I have to go find my phone again. Nah. So I bought this watch and after the first two days the battery life improved drastically (usually end with anywhere from 20% to 40% after a 16-hr day. Like right now it's after 10pm and I still have 48% left. Pro Tip: turn the screen off while watching TV.) And it understands my speech-to-text needs perfectly. Best of all, it has Google assistant so it seamlessly works with all my google stuff.\n\nNow my boss can call and I always pick up. I see emails immediately and can respond to the ones that actually need an immediate response, and same for txts.\n\nAs for the health/heartbeat functions I'm not into all that, so never use them.\n\nAll-in-all I am very happy with my smartwatch purchase, even though I am probably about to be laid off and can't afford it haha. Too late! I already love it so it stays.",

                "review_body": "I bought this specifically because I needed Wear OS integration. I have Type 1 Diabetes and wear an electronic device to continuously monitor my blood sugar, a Dexcom G6 CGM, and that only works with iOS or Wear OS. Otherwise, I might have chosen another watch, but this was one of the best of the Wear OS ones, although I considered a couple of MobvoiTicWatch watches.\n\nSo far, the features I use and can comment on:\n\n- I can see my blood glucose measurements on my watch at all times, which is why I needed Wear OS. This is fantastic. It relies on Bluetooth between the watch and has been reliable unless I am separated by multiple concrete walls.\n\n- The message integration is nice and keeps me alerted, and when I have 2-factor authentication for a site, I get the code on my watch, which is way more convenient than reaching for the phone. It is convenient to get my messages on the watch, and usually just swipe them away, or if interested, respond. It does transcribe verbal messages well.\n\n- I have taken calls on my watch, which is nice but can also be surprising if unexpected\n\n- I use the heart rate monitoring for my rowing and running workouts, which integrates with Google Fit. I'm not obsessed about the accuracy but the number lines up with my other heart rate monitor, a Scosche Rhythm 24. I use third-party apps to synchronize my Polar Beat and Withings BF Scale with Google Fit.\n\n- Throughout the day I use Google Assistant, the countdown timers, the stopwatch, the UV Index app, Google Breathe (this is nice)\n\n- I am enjoying sleep tracking to get a sense of how many hours of rest I am getting. (Sleep was added later in 9/2020, as part of a Wellness App update).\n\nQuibbles\n\n- The usual is the battery, but I generally get a full day with moderately active use, although if I'm very busy, I charge it while wearing one of my older watches. Charging is very fast.\n\n- Occasionally, I need to swipe twice if it doesn't recognize it, but that could be me.\n\n- On a few occasions, Google Assistant didn't respond, so I either turned it off then on or simply pressed the assistant icon and spoke then.",

It still could use a bit better battery life, but it has gotten a bit better after the update.\n------------\nI bought this watch because it has been consistently touted as the best smartwatch outside the Samsung/Apple ecosystems. If it is, having had a Galaxy watch, I can say that does not bode well for any brands besides the duopoly. That being said, it's a decent watch, just that you're really paying for brand on this one.\n\nAs a lot of others have said, the battery life leaves something to be desired - however, coming from older Galaxy watches a day and a half to two days is what I'm used to. I was thinking if I switched from the anemic Tizen ecosystem to Wear OS I'd have a plethora of things to run on my watch, but the Wear OS app store is as anemic as any of the other proprietary ones, though that's not on Fossil.\n\nThe controls are decent and the ability to program the side buttons is nice. The watch strap and back don't bother me, which is usually an issue so if you have sensitive skin, this doesn't bother a guy that can't wear surgical steel for the minute amount of nickel in it. I do really like that the straps are interchangeable, I have a few straps I've used with the watch so definitely a plus.\n\nThe voice functions and speaker are okay. As long as you're not out in traffic or on a loud construction site you can hear what's coming out of it. Good enough for \"can you pick up some bread while you're at the store\" conversations and using Assistant, not so much anything else. And it's especially annoying to bump the crown, which is both a button and a knob, and hear my watch say I'm sorry I didn't hear you and find out that assistant has been sitting on.\n\nAll in all, it's an okay watch. I'd definitely pay $120 for it, but not the $233 it was at when I bought it. Wear OS still has some maturing to do as a platform if it wants to play alongside the S/A duopoly because they really do have everyone beat.",

                "review_body": "The watch had functioned normally after I purchased it, but three months later, it stopped working entirely. Running its battery flat and connecting the adapter clearly indicated that it could charge as the watch would flash a charging indicator, but it would not do anything else and would soon stop even that. I had not subjected the watch to any possibly damaging situations. For instance, I never got it wet even though it's water resistant, nor did I subject it to shocks. The failure appears to be a quality assurance problem, although the specific cause in my case remains unknown. I reported this issue to the manufacturer, which covered the repair as it was still under warranty (one year). This process took a month or so, and it seems they replaced most or all of the components (the serial number has changed). The replacement watch has arrived very recently and is functioning well so far. If it experiences any problems, I will update this review.\nThis paragraph is about the software used by Fossil, Wear OS by Google, but is not specific to this particular watch. The operating system has several significant defects. The first is that, although it has the ability to use WiFi networks, it frequently decides that it's just not going to. The settings for WiFi are off and automatic, and automatic mode frequently means that it thinks it doesn't need to be connected right now. This meant that apps that used WiFi would either take several seconds to connect or would experience a large delay before informing me that no network was available. WiFi isn't needed if the watch is being used for time, notifications from a phone, or fitness tracking, but it would be for most complex apps. There used to be a developer setting that would prevent the automatic system disabling WiFi, but it has been removed. This is serious, as development virtually requires WiFi to synchronize data between the development computer and the test device, which is frequently broken. Similarly, connection to a paired phone over Bluetooth was spotty, and when it wasn't connected, it showed a notification about that often. I didn't use many features requiring a stable connection, but the constant notification was irritating. If you want a smartwatch in order to run complex applications, this platform will likely frustrate you, since most important functionality requires a network connection. For example, you can use dictation to type, but only if you're online. Otherwise you can try to type on a full QWERTY keyboard displayed on a watch screen, which is difficult. There are two programmable buttons, which are nice, but Wear Os only lets you use those buttons to launch applications. If you want a fast launch, that's great, but the system also puts the most recent three apps launched on the home screen so it's already easy. You can't map those buttons to specific features inside apps or to simulated key presses. If you use a degoogled AOSP-based Android, this watch won't work with it, or at all. It won't set itself up without the Wear OS app, and if you sideload that, it will complain and exit on startup. You have to install the app on an IOS or normal Android device for it to work, though a Google account isn't required. If you don't know what I just said, the situation probably doesn't apply to you.\nWhen functioning, this watch ran as expected. Battery life was about two days when not used intensively and with power-intensive features like always-on screen disabled, but would fall behind if called upon to do other tasks. If you intend to use a Wear OS watch, expect to charge it every day. Audio quality is surprisingly good for such a small speaker, with loud sound output possible. Location from the GPS/GLONASS chip was generally accurate but took a long time to initialize and dramatically affected battery life.\nIn conclusion, proceed with caution only if you understand and accept the limits. One anecdote doesn't constitute a study on resilience, but there may be problems with the hardware. Meanwhile, the software has limits which cannot be circumvented. If you don't need compatibility with Wear OS apps, you may not want to use this. If you are developing wearable apps, you have Samsung's Tizen and Apple's Watch OS as alternative platforms.",

The first day I wore it I received a random compliment from a bank teller who had no idea it was a even a smartwatch until I told her. So I definitely give it 5 stars for appearance, especially with all the cool watch faces you can choose from, download, or even custom make using 3rd party apps!\n\nUnfortunately, the native Google Fit app doesn't have the capabilities to monitor sleep tracking so you'll need to download and integrate a 3rd party app (such as 'Sleep As Android'). This was slightly inconvenient, but at least it works once you set it up and Google has done a good job of making it easy to integrate many 3rd party apps into Google Fit. However, it should be noted that while your watch can help capture your sleep data, you still won't be able to access your sleep data on the Google Fit app on your watch. Instead, that data will only be made visible on the Google Fit app on your phone. This is another slight inconvenience which is why I only gave the sleep tracking capabilities 3 stars at the end of the day.\n\nThe battery life is easily good enough to last you the entire day and even longer if you use the battery saving features and don't use it for making calls, playing music and other things that obviously require additional battery life. I personally like to utilize a lot of the watch features, including wearing it overnight for sleep tracking, so I have to designate some time each day to recharge it. Thankfully, the watch recharges extremely fast (20 minutes or less) so I gave it 5 stars for battery life.\n\nThe watch uses Google Wear OS as the native mobile app which is very easy and straightforward to use. You're able to change the watch settings, watch faces, connect accounts, and basically all the standard administrative tasks can be done within the app. Plus I have a Google Pixel phone so I'm not sure if that makes it any easier. I decided to give it 5 stars since the app basically does what I'd expect it to do with a clean interface.\n\nOverall, I gave the watch 4 stars just because of its inability to do certain things out the box without 3rd party apps. However, if you're willing to take the time to set it up you'll be able to customize it the way you want. Besides that, the smartwatch looks like a classy timepiece that will get attention. It also charges fast and has all the bells & whistles of any other smartwatch on the market. For the price I'd say this Fossil watch is a great option!",

Buttons also have a nicer feel the rotary dial middle button moves much smoother.  Fossil did a great job of upgrading this product without the expense of the battery.  I am getting probably a little more over a days charge with the AOD display on and all features on.  It has other options to extend the battery to a week and balance battery life.  Not to mention the screen is larger and the weight of the watch is still very comfortable for a middle aged man to carry.  I have not tried swimming with this watch like i did on my old sport but that watch handled normal swimming like a champ so I expect this will too.  If only Wear O.S had good swim tracking apps.\n\nPros For Me:\n- Peppy performance very little to no lag in menu transitions\n- Exceptional battery life (there are tricks to extend your battery performance) you should have no trouble making a full active day on one charge.\n- Improved heart rate tracking with Caridiogram pre installed.  The watch checks my heart rate every 5 minutes and still makes a full day charge\n- Easy to install your favorite watchband and inexpensive protective bumpers and screen covers can be found if your tough on your watch like I am.\n- Fossil kept the same charger! So if your upgrading like me your old chargers still work and you can keep a spare in the car or office.  Thank you fossil!  Spare chargers are also inexpensive and easy to find for your travel needs.\n- Great watch faces - Fossil packs  a good selection but Wear O.S in general gives you a ton of options that you can change up for mood and occasions.\n\nCons:\n- Wear O.S is still wear o.s but it has come a long way to be more smart watch competitive.\n- The Style of this watch is simplistic and not very flashy so it will not standout if that is what you are looking for\n- I wish fossil would make a watch with a rotating ring around the face like some of the Samsung watches.  I would buy that watch in a heartbeat!\n- I think it does sleep tracking but since you need to charge the watch at night you cant really use this feature.\n- No cellular options.  I had this on my old LG smart watches and while I did not use it often it would be nice if it was a option for when you cant be near your phone.",

                "review_body": "Slow process getting to the point where forking over the dough for a Wear OS watch looked appealing. My goal: tight, trouble free integration with Google Fit, which is my favorite app for collecting and visualizing exercise, weight, and similar data.\nOther solutions I tried had spotty data syncing (MiFit) or overwrote the weight data from my smart scale (VeryFitPro).\nPleased to report that using Fossil Gen 5 to track steps and walks and other exercise events sends data promptly and reliably to Google Fit both on the watch and on my phone. Weight data from my Wyze scale syncs well to Fit and nothing overwrites it.\nFossil's sleep tracker syncs fine w/Fit, but isn't all that accurate at detecting when I'm asleep and when awake... so, I'm not sure what that's worth. Sleep tracking was not a priority anyway.\nBattery life is a challenge, but not bad once you get the watch customized and quit fiddling with it. The process of navigating a lot and installing apps, and other customizing eats up battery quicker than anything else. I can get 24 hours easy now and probably 2 days if I tried a little.\nThe black silicon band looks cool in flat black but it's a magnet for tiny bits of skin and anything else that isn't flat black.... so looks dirty most of the time. I'll be replacing that soon. It is quite comfortable though.\nI have small bones, so I wear it on second to the last hole. The watch itself is a wee bit bulky but not bad. Here's to hoping that in the future the battery life doubles while the watch gets thinner. :-)  ... chances are good, eventually.\n---\nUpdate 4/14/22\nIt's been just over a year. The watch has held up pretty well, but I have to knock a star off, maybe two. The watch has an intermittent problem where it rapidly drains its battery for no apparent reason. In support forums, etc., others report similar problems. Theories range from wifi connection to 'just a glitch, reset the watch and you'll be fine.' The random fast drain is very fast. This morning I took it off the charger at 7:30 AM. It had about 10% battery left at noon. Usually, after restarting watcha and recharging, it's normal again for a period. Usually weeks, but sometimes only a few days.\nRecently the fast drain thing happened when I was at an event, and it was a bummer to go to do a tracked walk and discover there wasn't enough power left (early afternoon).\nBattery is a struggle even when it's not acting up. It makes it through day, excluding any sleep cycle. That is, there is not enough battery to get through 24 hrs. More like 16 or 18.  And with the margin so tight, if you turn on an activity that enables GPS and heart rate checking (usually I don't have that turned and don't have heart rate turned on either), then forget to turn it off when you're done...  Battery is going to be zapped way before bedtime.\nSo, I'm shopping for something better. Given the demands of Wear OS, you have to plan to spend more than $300 (probably a lot more) to get a battery life that will forgive imperfect power management and still get you through 24 hours. Given how I actually used the watch over the last year, it doesn't look like Wear OS and Google Fit are worth it. 99% of the features I actually use are available on fitness watches like Garmin's line with triple or quadruple the battery life. I will probably wave goodbye soon to both Wear OS and Google Fit until the tech catches up with practical realities and practical pricing.",

                "review_body": "As far as smartwatches go, this is undoubtedly the best one to buy in terms of cost/performance. I'll break down the various parts of the watch, what works, and what doesn't, and add final thoughts below. I'll be comparing this at some points to the TicWatch 2020, as it is one of the closest competitors.\n\nCase:\nThe case is made of lightweight metal, and the lugs for the band are very sturdy as well. The fact that the charge contacts are rings and not points is also a plus.\n\nFace & Bezel:\nThe face is clear, and easy to read, but here's where I'll be deducting some points: First, the face and screen are not exactly honest, as there is a 4mm dead ring between the bezel and true screen. I like a watch with a nice big face, and was hoping this would compare to the Ticwatch, but sadly, it does not. The lack of a raised bezel is also a bad thing, as this makes the addition of a screen protector necessary.\n\nPower:\nFortunately, this watch supports fast charging, compared to the Ticwatch, which must be charged specifically at 5v/1a, or it will burn out. Battery life is acceptable, so long as you treat this more as a watch... Any heavy usage will mean running out of power before your day is over. The power saver mode means it doesn't turn into a complete paperweight, but a second TFT screen would be appreciated so you could still do things like step counting, as is available on the Ticwatch 2020.\n\nWaterproofing:\nThe full swimmability is greatly appreciated, since for the money the last thing you want is to lose this to a fall off the dock, or getting pushed into the pool.\n\nBand:\nThe band is OK, but not very good. Switch to a multilink metal band instead for better ventilation and ease of cleaning. I recommend this one, or similar: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GZC81MP/\n\nControls:\nThe two programmable buttons, and center crown are the most usable set of manual controls, hands down. I never get tired of using the crown to scroll through menus. This is far better than any two-button setup.\n\nStorage:\nThe fact that you have almost 6gb to install apps is far and away top of the line, with most other competitors offering barely 1.5gb\n\nSpeed:\nThe Snapdragon 3100 makes WearOS function smoothly, with no noticeable lag when operating menus, streaming music, using your phone as a periscope or remote camera, and even playing video. The low power cores mean ambient mode does not flicker, even with a full color screen.\n\nSensors:\nThe heart rate sensor seems to be accurate, and off-body detection works. Tap and Pay works as expected.\n\nFeatures I'd like to see in a future version:\nBigger screen that is truly what size it claims to be, hopefully as big as the Ticwatch screen.\nDual screen (like the Ticwatch) for low power mode.\nRaised bezel, for protection without the need for a screen protector.\nLeft Handed Mode\n\nOverall, this is one of the best options out there, with the only major issues being the false screen size, and lack of a raised bezel. If you want a smaller screen, this watch will meet your needs nicely.",

                "review_body": "I spent a lot of time researching this watch. ??\n\nThe reviews on the battery life made me iffy about buying it but I haven't had an issue with that. It's between 50-70% (depending on the watch face I use) by the time I get home (10?ish hour day). Took it off the charger at 6:30a today. It's 8:23p and has 33% charge. There's all these different battery settings you can use to extend the life. I definitely had to finagle the bagel when I first got it because if I hadn't, by the end of this review it would have been dead already.\n\nI had a Galaxy Active. I wanted my watch to make noise and Galaxy did not. The vibration isn't what I wanted either. I do a lot of moving at work and don't always hear/feel my phone. This watch is loud and clear. The vibration is very noticeable.\n\nI only used the phone on the watch 3 times. It wasn't terrible. The conversations were short though. Most times I'm not in a setting where being Inspector Gadget is appropriate.\n\nI didn't like that the band is so big. I tried purchasing a 20mm band and they don't fit. I thought maybe that would solve the issue. I guess since I have average size womens' wrists, maybe I should have gotten the Juliana? But that's not what I wanted ??????? Anyway, I made an extra hole. That was a little tough, too. Which is good- the band does not tear/rip/puncture easily. ????\n\nSomeone said there aren't a lot of watch faces to choose from. I use Facer and I've found plenty free faces that I like, so I guess it's a personal preference. ???????\n\nI bought this fancy bumper (because it was the only one I could find that wasn't that weird plastic that turns brown after some months and that also doesn't impact my being able to use/see the screen) and a separate set of plastic screen protectors for preservation.\n\nI don't use it for the sleep tracking. I take it off at night to charge. I don't use the GPS tracking. I don't like to keep my location on any device. Um..in my sleep apparently I took 70 steps, so either I sleep walk or it's really sensitive to movement. ?? The heart monitor seems fairly accurate (in comparison to my Galaxy).\n\nI like the Galaxy app better than the WearOS app. I feel it could definitely be better, give more options- something. It's very minimal.\n\nComes with a charging cord and...that's it (other than the paperwork) ?? There's not 2 bands, like with the Galaxy.\n\nI'm happy over all though.\n\n???? July 2021 Update: I haven't had ANY issues with my watch. I thought I may have an issue due to the physicality of my job, but nope! They've done an update on the WearOS app and I'm glad. It isn't 100% better, but it is 54.96% better than it was. ?? Everything is copastetic.",

For some background, I'm a Pixel owner who was looking for something that would feel seamless with the most recent Android operating system. I also wanted something that looked like a watch rather than a fitness band, as well as something that had GPS built in to track my bike rides.\n\nPros:\n* Well-built physical quality - I've worn it every day since it came, and it has been both comfortable and resilient. Granted, I work from home currently, so we'll see how it hold up when I'm back to a daily commute to the office.\n* Good variety of features - it has bluetooth, wifi, GPS, and NFC. It has lots of apps to add if you like, as well as lots of watch face options. For the price, it's got a robust feature set that you can tailor to whatever you need.\n* Good Android integration - one of the main reasons I got it. It's been nice to have it automatically feed my step counts and GPS into other apps\n* Google Pay and Google Assistant integration - Pay has been great, and I've started using it to pay whenever I end up buying something in person. I haven't really used assistant all that often, but largely because I have Google Home Minis throughout the house and I don't leave much. I'm hopeful that I can use assistant a bit more down the road\n* Always on display - I like that it still feels like a watch. I can look at my wrist to see the time\n* Swappable bands - I got a second band (leather) from Fossil, and it's easy to swap to fit my mood.\n\nCons:\n* Terrible setup UX - took me forever. I had to restart and reinstall several apps in order to just get it to recognize my phone.\n* Battery life - just isn't that great if you wear it all day with Bluetooth, Wifi, and notifications all day\n* Battery saving modes - while I understand why it does it, I wish it wouldn't turn off bluetooth randomly to save battery. I suddenly realize I've missed messages because of the switch\n* Weird connectivity overall - I've had a lot of dropped connectivity between this and my phone. I feel like it may have to do with connecting my phone to my computer, however, so I'm still troubleshooting\n* Charger feels cheap\n* I wish they sent something to remove links. I have very large hands/forearms, and it was big on me, so I'd imagine I'm not the only one in this boat. I ended up going ot the Fossil store, and they were incredibly nice and accommodating. They helped me get the fit just-right. Still, would be nice to have better instructions to do it myself\n\nOverall, this felt like, and still feels like, the best option on the market for a Pixel owner. It does everything I needed it to do, despite some quirks. If they could bring in some minor improvements, I feel like it would knock it out of the park.",

                "review_body": "It has been almost two years since I started wearing this and I thought I would come back and give a last update. At this point I wear this some of the time. It went from the watch I used most to this. Main reason for this was the battery hassle. You have to turn the display off and can't even use shake to activate to get a full day of use out of it. And I can't really be bothered having to charge it every day. I've switched mostly to a Skagen hybrid smart watch. I can't make calls using it but I don't really need it for that anyway.\nAll that aside, I do still like this fossil watch. The functions are incredibly useful, there's lots of space left to get apps, and it has lost nothing of it's functions.\n\nI started out rating this quite highly because my initial impression is that it is a great watch. This can change and I will come back to update this if it turns out to be poor.\nSet up. Oh this was hard at first but deep breath, it can be done with minimal fuss and a time travel device. Dont pair your phone using Bluetooth until the prompt tells you to do it. Download wear os while this thing starts up. Allow locations in your phone settings then follow the wear os directions while your phone is next to the watch. It will set up but your phone has a Bluetooth pass code to connect. If it fails it's because your phone has already connected so you need to factory restore the watch and restart your phone.\nApps. Great connectivity from a Google phone as it lets you connect to all the apps from your account with minimal fuss. Download for Facebook messenger took a little while but nothing bad.\nBattery seems to drop off very quick with extended use and download for apps. There is a battery customization mode to let you use it as little as possible to make the battery last. Also you can turn the display always on mode to off and save more power. Initially it was draining quickly so I will come back and let you know how it goes.\nAppearance very nice but I'm afraid of that large display and have already bought screen protectors. Totally recommending this if you get this watch. The screen is huge and it is sensetive too. You can swipe easily and it doesn't appear to lag. This means it's expensive to replace so don't take a risk with it.\n\nAnd I will be back to update.\n\nUpdate... I'm discovering what some of the other reviewers said about the battery. On normal use mode it wouldn't last a day before you have to recharge it. So I'm taking it down to 4 stars because of that. This doesn't mean it's bad. It means you must go to the battery options and set it to extended use. I can tell you I left the house this morning at  7 am with the battery at 100%, returning home at 4.30pm and it's at 77%. This is with extended use settings and throughout the day very minimal use of the watch. Turning it on to check the time, pestering the wifey with a few nuisance texts, glancing at the news headlines because I was bored at work. That sort of thing.\nFor me this isn't perfect but it's not terrible either. I don't mind charging at the end of the day.\nOne other thing I noticed is that you must swipe from the sides. It might feel unresponsive to touch gestures but it really isn't. You just have to start at the side.\n\nAlso tried making a phone call with the watch. I had to footer about with the settings a bit to get it to work but once it was set up correctly, the call quality was fine. I could hear the other person well and the call on the other end was working great, too.\nAlso tried speech to text and as per usual for Scottish folk, that doesn't always work out too well. Can't blame the watch for that.\n\nA sort of update to the update...\n\nOk I get it now. I had an initial impression followed by the first part of a learning curve. That's my mistake.  This is the first smart watch I have used and my reaction was to treat it like a normal watch but one that does stuff. It's not quite that. It's a device that comes with a learning curve. You have to be patient with it and learn how to use it, what to do, how to experiment with it, and what not to do. One week in and I'm finding that out for myself by downloading new apps, and discarding others, changing settings and learning new functions.. So far my Impression is net positive. I'm happy with this and look forward to using it going forward.\n\nUpdate...\n\nI dont really need to charge this every day but find myself doing so anyway. If you want to keep a decent charge of 80 percent or so then you need to charge each day. But that's not a hassle because it charges quickly.\n Loving some of the apps for this. Fotmob has all the soccer scores I want and it will ring on my watch to let me know when my team are tragically losing once again.\nThere appears to be a distance I can remain close to my phone to have all the functions work properly. I've noticed indoors it appears to be about fifteen feet or so. I'm happy with that. Still very happy with the watch.\n\nUpdate. Last one I think. Changed it from a four to a three. I like it, but made a discovery that made me like it a little less. I took it off for the weekend, with the whole thing set to basically off. I didn't touch it and the watch wasn't doing anything for two whole days. When I took it off the charge was about 80 percent and when I picked it up again it was about 16 percent.\nThat's just daft. The battery ran down doing nothing.\nUgh.",

                "review_body": "I've been patiently waiting for years, for the perfect smart watch that would \"check all the boxes,\" and the Fossil Gen 5 comes pretty close.  Here's my honest review.\n\nTHE FACE\nWhen I opened the box, the watch face was smaller than I expected, and I was disappointed to see that a black circle of non-active margin surrounds that actual display, making the real display even smaller than the smaller-than-expected watch face. But I've survived a week with it. Also, I don't know that other watches out there have a larger display. This was just my reaction to it.\n\nFONT SIZE\nNext, I noticed just how small the type/font is on the screen for most notifications. Given my age and eye sight, the tiny print was near impossible to read. Fortunately, there is an accessibility setting to slightly increase the font size, though not much.\n\nBUILD QUALITY\nThe watch itself is built well, and it seems solid. The stainless steel band seems light weight, but does a good job. As a whole, it does not feel like a toy. It feels like a mid-range watch.\n\nCHARGING CORD\nThe charging cord, however, feels like a cheap piece of plastic and wire. It does not feel like a brand-name item, but rather, it feels like a replacement cord you would find on a rack for $1.\n\nThe charging wire does not come with a charging block. Instead, you have to plug the USB-A end of it into a computer or other USB outlet.\n\nAlso, the charging wire is incredibly short. Way too short. I don't think it's even 3 feet. It would be fine if it were plugged into my computer, but it's not at all long enough to have on your nightstand, even if an outlet us nearby on the wall.\n\nLastly, the charging cord is magnetic and snaps onto the back. Two small pins then make contact with the case to charge. (It is not wireless.) HOWEVER, it's a relatively loose fit and does not have that satisfying snap connection that you expect. So you connect it, and set your watch down and just HOPE that it stays connected. I would prefer a connection that snaps, has a strong magnet, and you can feel confident in the connection.\n\nAPPS\nI am incredibly disappointed in the lack of apps for this smart watch, and for Wear OS in general. You would think that the company that makes Wear OS (Google) would make apps for it's most popular products like Gmail... but no, there is no Gmail app. There's no Google Voice app. etc.\n\nNOTIFICATIONS\nWhile there aren't many apps to use, the notifications do work well. When your phone would normally beep or vibrate, so too does your watch. It shows me notifications for incoming Email, Google Voice messages, and even notifications from other apps. That's nice. For the messages, you can often reply back to the person, by using either the microphone or smart reply. That's nice.\n\nA big downside of the notifications system, however, is that there's no way to go back and look at previous or old notifications. So if grandma sent an email to me 20 minutes ago, and I already swiped away the notification, I cannot go back to it.\n\nNFC\nI waited for a watch that has NFC for mobile payments / Google Pay. This watch does it, but so far I have not used it. I have my credit card all set up, but the first time I was at a store, I could not get the watch to do it, and I had to resort to my phone. This may be user error on my part. Hopefully I can learn to just quickly use my watch.\n\nGOOGLE FIT\nFor tracking fitness, I like that the watch is counting my steps, and that I can see my overall accomplishments for the day. I can use the watch to start a new activity (like running) but in that process, the crown does not function to scroll the list of activities. So you have to use your finger on the small screen.\n\nPHONE CALLS\nI also waited for a watch that has a speaker and mic. So far I have only accepted one call on my watch. I guess it was okay. Unfortunately people just don't make calls these days so it's not something I've used much.\n\nSPEAKER / MUSIC / MEDIA\nI have not been able to play music directly on the watch and out of the watch's speaker. I've also not played music from the watch and to headphones. So I cannot say those things work or don't. When you are using Spotify or Google Play, you can use the watch to skip forward and back on tracks, and play/pause, and adjust volume. I've used the watch to control music playing across the room on my Google Home; the stream was coming from the network and not from the watch.\n\nFINAL RULING\nThis watch normally sells for $295 and I bought it on sale for $205. When I first opened the package and played with it for about 30 minutes, my gut told me to send it back. But I decided to give it some time and extra chances. During the past week I have learned to appreciate the heart rate monitor and step counting aspect of the watch. I suppose I could say I like the notifications, too, though I am not too sure how much that helps my life versus the identical notifications on my phone! I admit to being a Google Fanboy with the latest Google products, and at the same time I am incredibly jealous that it SEEMS those with Apple Watches can do far more with their watch/phone combo. I could be wrong, but I bet they have better access to their email, messages, etc, via their watches. Is the Fossil Gen 5 worth $205, probably. Would I recommend it for $295? No way. Do I hope a future Wear OS has better features that can compete with Apple, and would I pay extra for that? Absolutely.",

                "review_body": "As you can tell, this is a quick summary of my experience using this watch with an IPhone, but a lot of the issues would be present no matter what device you have. It should also be noted I have the iPhone XR, which still functions great but is a couple years old now.\nTo start off, it was a rocky setup. I downloaded the \u201cwearOS\u201d app and the google fit app like it requires, and got everything set up. It was very glitchy and many of the features flat out didn\u2019t work and it couldn\u2019t stay connected. But once I factory reset the watch and went over the setup again, it seemed to work much better.\nIt also seems to work better when you keep the \u201cwearOS\u201d app open on the background. That probably sounds like it should be obvious but since everything goes through Bluetooth I figured it\u2019d be fine. I\u2019m the type that never really keeps any app running in the background.\nAs far as features, it has everything you could want but you can\u2019t use any of them due to the stupid low battery life. On an average day, it tracks my steps fine and I occasionally ask it for a BPM. This will being the battery down to about 15% by the time I\u2019m going to bed. Although, if you do anything else such as use more apps or track a workout with it for longer then 30 minutes, it will die on you before the sun sets. It\u2019s definitely not meant for longer durations of tracking, which also means sleep tracking is non existent unless you manage to charge it right before bed and then use the watch. But not only will you need to charge it again once awake, I doubt it will get through the full night before it\u2019s dead again.\nAnswering phone calls on this thing and trying to use the microphone is a joke. Unless you\u2019re in a quiet, private area, you won\u2019t be able to hear the caller. And to them, you either sound far away, or underwater.\nLastly is the Bluetooth interruptions. I feel like this is one of the biggest problems for most people because more and more devices require Bluetooth pairing, like car radios for example. For whatever reason, this watch will override whatever other device you try to use. The only fix I have for it is to completely turn off the Bluetooth on my phone, then turn it back on and connect to the device before the watch connects. Even the phone calls, when I answer a call using my truck, it\u2019ll sometimes switch to my watch for no reason after a few minutes.\nAll in all, it\u2019s not really worth the price. It\u2019s got tons of features and looks pretty slick, but the terrible battery life, dumb random glitches, and the way it wants to prioritize itself above everything is just not worth it. If you catch this on sale for less than $200 maybe give it a go. But I would honestly save up the extra hundred or two for something better. Especially if you\u2019re an IPhone user.",

                "review_body": "It has been a few days and I truly love this watch. It's by far the most beautiful watch in it's class. It's first and foremost a smartwatch designed to look amazing, with fitness tracker features pumped into it. The mobile app is well put together with a lot of customizable options, but I wish it had a couple of features.\n\nPROS\nBeautiful watch.\nSmooth and efficient touchscreen.\n8G memory great for tons of apps.\nMany customizable options.\nGPS, NFC\nSpeaker is surprisingly loud.\nThe list goes on and on.\n\nCONS\nBattery life is poor given all the hi-tech stuff that demand juice. First couple of days I literally watched the battery drain in a few hours, but after a few days of tweaking features it started about a day. Time only mode makes it last longer but you'll have to restart the watch to get out of that mode. Maybe a free extra car charger would help in the meantime.\nSilicon band isn't the best quality, started showing streaks by day 2...but it's very comfortable though.\n\nWISH LIST\nBattery last up to a week with GPS/NFC off.\nBe able to store pics/audio/video through the app so they can be played or viewed later. The Fossil hybrid HR lets you load pic without FB.\n\nUPDATE\nAfter almost 2 months I still love the watch...except the really bad battery life. It has never lasted beyond 36hrs (1.5days) even tho i turn off everything (NFC, GPS, wifi, tilt to wake, touch to wake, always on, speaker etc).\nBasically, with btooth off at night, and notifications turned off 6hrs a day, it might last 24hrs. You have to not use it in order to be able to use it...yea, might defeat the purpose.\nIt would've been perfect if it could last a few days. Might just switch to the not so beautiful Samsung galaxy 3.",

                "review_body": "I will not buy another Fossil. After only 1.5 years of owning this Fossil Gen 5 I'm about to buy a Samsung watch because I'm fed up with recent performance of the Fossil Gen 5. Once bitten...\n\nSoon after the warranty expired I started having problems with battery life. The problems seemed to coincide with an update of the Fossil app, but I can't be certain of that. What I know is that certain battery mode options were removed. What's more, the update removed the OEM watch face I was using, and did not offer a new suitable similar watch face. In all fairness, a recent Fossil update restored the watch face that was removed.\n\nDespite running the same apps and same settings daily, battery life has always been unpredictable, but it used to last a day. Not so much any more even under very restricted usage.\n\nDuring the first year I was running with Gestures, WiFi, Bluetooth, heart-rate tracking, and NFC on, and without the always-on screen (instead a gesture would turn on the screen). Prior to the update the watch still had 30-50% of life remaining after a workday. Some days it would use battery at a faster rate than other days, and on the worst days it would automatically switch to extended mode in need of a charge. I would put it back on the charger before bed, then at bedtime use it overnight for sleep tracking. Overnight the battery drain was minimal.\n\nNow days, after the Fossil update (and after warranty expiration), the battery will run dry in four hours or less using the same settings I was using in the first year. It won't even last for a full night's sleep. Occasionally it will last a workday, but that is rare and I have not been able to figure out why some days are good. I have since turned off gestures, WiFi, and NFC. With those \"desired\" features disabled I can usually get a full day out of the watch, but at the expense of not using features that I want.\n\nAnd yes...I did do a factory reset hoping that would resolve the problems. No luck. The same issues were evident even before I started putting my few apps back on the watch.\n\nStill, and here's that unpredictable part again, occasionally when I take the watch off the charger, with the features still turned off, the watch starts churning through the battery at an alarming rate. In minutes it will turn itself off and the only way to turn it back on is to put it on the charger again. After the watch restarts it will indicate the battery is quite high...like 85%. So why did it shut down?\n\nIn my opinion paying a premium price for just over one year of good use is not acceptable.  I'm hoping my next watch (from Samsung) will be a much better experience.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOriginal review: Nice looking watch, better battery life than expected.\n\nI'm pleased so far with this purchase. I was concerned about the battery life I would get, but so far battery life has not been an issue. Keep in mind that the first day or so the watch will be installing updates and new apps, and you will spend more time with it. But with all of that done, I'm getting well over a full day. It will still have ~25% of battery remaining when I put it back on the charger. This is even after using it all night for sleep monitoring!\n\nThe only things I've turned off are the Always On display and the \"OK Google\" detection. For the display, I have activated gestures so that the display comes on when I rotate my wrist. As for OK Google, I just swipe left for the Google Assistant. I have not disabled heart rate tracking, and I let Google Fit monitor (heart/steps) all the time. Otherwise I'd forget to start it for a workout.\n\nAs for charging, the watch charges to 100% in about an hour. I think the only con I can come up with is that this watch does not work with wireless charging (as do some Galaxy watches). It would be nice to be able to use the wireless back-to-back charging capability from my phone if I'm ever caught out without the phone's own charger. Hopefully Fossil will offer that next time around.\n\nAs for being a watch, it works nice. It has apps for stopwatch and timers. I've not played much with the watch faces...I just picked one and probably will rarely change it. The watch works well with texting, email (including Outlook), calendar, and weather.\n\nI cannot yet speak using the watch for phone calls. I have not yet had an opportunity for a Dick Tracey wrist phone experience.\n\nI've recently installed the Sleep as Android app. So far it is impressive for what it is. I wear the watch overnight so I don't have to leave my phone on the bed. I have not yet tried the Cardiogram app.\n\nOther apps I've loaded: A great compass app (Steel 3d I think?). Google Pay...works great on the watch! Google Maps is loaded, but I have not used it yet.\n\nIf you are into disc golf, you can keep score for multiple players on your watch using the UDisc app. I've done so several times and it has mostly worked great. Twice though it had a syncing issue where I had to finish keeping score on my phone. Both times I had opened the phone to access other features of UDisc, after which the watch scoring glitched. I think that's just a syncing bug that UDisc needs to figure out.\n\nAs for size, I was concerned about that too. I do not like the oversized mongo watches. I prefer something less bulky. This is as large as I would want on my average sized wrists. Anything larger would be too big, I think. Anything smaller would not be usable for a smart watch.\n\nI bought the version with the brown leather band. The leather band is very nice...good quality. I also bought an after-market silicone band for playtime. I'd rather preserve the nice leather band for dressier occasions.\n\nI avoided buying a smart watch for years because I was not impressed by the battery life and the apps available. I am happy to say that I think they are worth it now. My only fear now is that Google will abandon Wear OS following the Fitbit acquisition. I hope not, because I think Wear OS is just now coming into it's own and can only get better as more developers and manufacturers adopt it.",

                "review_body": "Fossil is well knows brand of watches. I was looking for a Wearos based Smart watch for  last few months. I got opportunities to try other competing brands of smartwatches of the same price range. Fossil Gen 5 meet my expectations and I would recommend this watch because of the following pros:-\n1. Size: the round watch fits perfectly on your wrists and give an executive look. You never feel the watch is heavy for your wrist.\n2. Display: Scratch free and waterproof display works perfectly together with soft touch screen.\n3. Buttons: Easy scrolling and fast responses middle button. The two up and down small buttons can be customised.\n4. Interface: Initial configuration is very simple and easy.  WearOS allows you to connect with your smartphone quickly, easily. The connection seems to be very stable.\n5. Install/Uninstall custom applications: Most of the necessary applications that you use in smartphone are available in WearOS. Google Play Store is pre-installed.\n6. Activity tracking: Google for works perfect and synch with the phone.\n7. Notification: Keep your phone away and see all the notifications in your writst. Reply to email/messages/WhatsApp/Mail/Facebook, etc..\n6. Speaker & Microphone: in-built speaker and Microphone allow you to make/answer calls and get quick audible ouput from Google Assistant. Use Google Assistant as you use in your phone.\n7. Memory: The watch has 1Gb RAM and approximately 5.6Gb internal memory got storage. The watch is relatively Faster compared to the other competing brands.\n8. Battery modes: it has Daily/Extend/Custom/ Time-only modes. On average 1.5 days with all Daily mode. Time custom mode or Time only mode to save battery if needed.\n9. Charger: Very light weight and not bulky charger. Comfortable to use.\n10. Band - I used the Silicon band and I love it. It is water proof.\n\nMost commonly reportedly issues and tips.\n\n1. Google Assistant audio response not working -- It works if you set the same language (eg. English U.S) in your phone and watch.\n2. Unable to use watch mic and speaker to answer call -- For this you have to make sure that  I). 'Use phone audio in watch' is ON in watch, ii) While pairing with your blue tooth turn on the option for pairing audio in phone (go to blue tooth settings on your phone and click on the watch name, change settings).\n3. Battery life: the watch holds many functions as a  mini wrist phone. To extend the battery life please use a suitable battey mode, turn off WiFi and locations if not necessary. Use 'low energy source' charger like USB port of your laptop.\n\nI hope you enjoy the watch.\nCons: I dont think is there something to highlight.\n\nSome people say the battery performance is poor, but it depends on their use and battey mode.\n\n** It is an Unbiased review based on my experience and experience from my close friends.\n\nThank you",

                "review_body": "I've had this for just under a week now and so far I really like it. My only legit complaint is the knobs and buttons on the side of the watch frame. I wish they were flat, I find that I accidentally long press the google assistant button a lot when I have to bend my wrist for more than a second. This hasn't been enough for me to return the watch though. I've just ended up pushing it up on my wrist a little higher and it seems to have helped. Additionally, the wrist straps are incredibly easy to swap. There's just a little silver nub where the band connects to the watch on the underside, you have to slide and hold it and the band comes out. Makes for incredibly easy changing between sport bands and nicer leather or metal bands for more formal situations. I took them both off and put them back on in less than a minute.\n\nNow for the big stuff -- I'll get right to it first and foremost since it is mentioned in a lot of reviews. The battery...\n\n**For anyone claiming to have terrible battery right out of the box, I suggest installing all the updates and doing a full overnight charge first. Battery performance was a little wonky during setup and while downloading and installing the updates, but after the first night it's been great. If you still have trouble then I suggest returning it or contacting Fossil for support for defective battery. ***\n\nBATTERY LIFE - I've customized some of the features, but for the most part they're all on. I've only turned off the sound and the ability to answer and take calls on the watch. I've never had to do take a call on my watch and I just see it as an irrelevant feature personally.  Additionally, I don't have the screen set to \"always on\" or \"touch to wake\" and instead use \"tilt to wake\". I start my day at 6:30a with 100% watch battery and arrive home about 5p every day and haven't fallen below 60% battery. This is with the features below on and with normal use by replying to texts, tracking walks with GPS, setting timers and alerts and occasionally using the google assistant.\n\nI have the following all turned on 100% of the time:\n-GPS (only activates while tracking exercise)\n-Wifi - always on and connected to my phone when not in bluetooth range\n-Cloud backup\n-Heart rate  monitoring (set to measure HR every 10 minutes all day)\n-Google Fit Syncing\n\nWater resistance - According to the Fossil website, this watch is 3 ATM rated water resistance which means you can shower, wash your hands, get sweaty, etc without worrying. The 3 ATM rating means you should (in theory) be able to submerge your watch in water while swimming up to a depth of 100 feet. I personally don't know if I want to test this, but I have gotten it wet while washing my hands and its been fine.\n\nIt's got a little bit of weight to it, so coming from a samsung gearfit that was rectangle and very light, it's taken some getting used to with the weight and round shape. It is a solid watch though.\n\nThe screen is excellent, I've used it in a variety of lighting, including high-noon direct sunlight and the screen brightens up and it's perfectly readable. If you have bigger fingers, some of the buttons can be a little annoying to tap, but overall I've not had any major issue with the touch screen.\n\nThe silicon strap is comfortable and has many notches for the perfect fit. As I said above, also incredibly easy to swap between the sport bands and a nicer leather or metal band.\n\nIn conclusion, I was worried a little bit about getting a round watch and I had been keeping my eye out for a square option, but I haven't found any with Wear OS support (this was important to me for fitness tracking with google Fit). I'm glad I went with this option though because the watch looks great and I can get a nicer band to wear to more formal functions.",

                "review_body": "This is my second smartwatch. My first smart watch was a Huawei First Generation. I was very resistant at first getting a smart watch because I hate the square bezel look ( Apple). My Huawei still works but after about four years of ownership the LCD screen has been developing some \"artifacts\" ( LCD burn in, like the old plasma TVs).\nI've been watching some smart watches for about 1 year now and had price alerts on them. The Fossil went considerably lower, to a price that I was comfortable with ( well under $200 ). I had to buy it. I had my eye on some Samsung Galaxy which I heard has amazing battery life but since my old watch was using Wear OS Google, I didn't feel like jumping ship to Tizen.\nSo, the good about the watch...it is a very good looking watch. I have the metal bracelet smoke. I like the fact that the screen on the outside is just as big as my Huawei (44mm I think) which isn't big. I have a medium size wrist. It is thinner and much lighter than Huawei 1st generation. The quality of the graphics is top notch. Set up was easy, painless on my Motorola Z4 phone. It stays connected, never drops off bluetooth. I didn't buy it to use the workout functions. They could be great, I don't know but if I wanted a workout watch I would buy an ugly square Garmin or whatever. I like to get texts, answer calls on it, do some speech to text replies. It works great for that. The screen brightness I think it is great. I keep it on auto or brightness at level 2.\nSo, now the bad. Biggest elephant in the room is the battery life. I kept it on the daily battery function with brightness on auto and most of the sensors off, but wifi and bluetooth on. I also keep the screen always on, but obviously it darkness a little after 3-5 seconds. I don't want that function off. I need to be able to see what time it is at a quick glance without needing to touch the screen, buttons, etc. I do get notifications but only messages ( WhatsApp, Viber and Messages). I don't really talk on it. I get about 15-25 WhatsApp messages per day, 20-25 texts and 3-4 Viber texts. I never check heart rate, never use GPS, NFC ( those are off). So my first day with it, the battery lasted 12 hours. My 4 year old Huawei lasts the same.??\nI know the battery is only slightly bigger in Fossil than the Huawei but c'mon...I was expecting close to 24 hrs.\nAlso, the graphics of watch faces don't seem to cover the whole glass area. There's a tiny portion that isn't covered. Not a big deal but my Huawei is pretty much full screen. So I don't want to say Fossil is a bad watch. Not at all, but let me summarize. If I had paid $295 ( full price) for my Huawei 1st generation, I would  still be very pleased. If I would have paid $280 for the Fossil...hmm....??....not really. Battery let's it down. At the price I paid? I am not dancing with joy but I think is ok. I am torn between three and four stars but battery life is a big deal to me and because of this, I have a hard time giving it a four.\nSo, after a few days of playing with the setting I think I can get 16-18 hrs of battery which I guess it's ok. I turn Wifi Off, NFC off, heart monitoring off and I keep the brightness at 2 which for me is plenty. The watch is otherwise flawless. I decided to give it a four star.",

                "review_body": "I didn't really see a reason to own a wearable, but I was intrigued and I figured I'd see what all the fuss was about.  I wanted something that would sync up effortlessly with my Pixel 3, be highly readable, offer vibe, and have physical buttons.  I also wanted a round face (I find the square/rectangular ones ugly) and a metal band.  That narrowed the field down considerably.  The Galaxy Watch was a strong contender until I realized that many of the features are only active with Galaxy phones.  A buddy at work has a Garmin Fenix for twice the price of the Fossil.  I ordered the Fossil.\n\nSetup went easy and I had it running/synced in minutes.  The smoked stainless looks very classy, much better than the cheap, plasticky look of many of these devices.  There was plenty room in the bracelet even with my thick wrist - I ended up pulling two links (doable, but not very easy).\n\nI was initially disappointed with the size of the digital display font despite the large face, and none of the options on the WearOS app seemed to be \"just right\".  In addition, the battery life was not great for the first couple of days.  It took me some doing, but I found a free face on a third party app that looks and works terrific, plus it seems to have extended the battery life.  I can go 18+ hours on a full charge with the ambient display and BT on, however the charger works very quickly - popping on the charger for even a few minutes can add several hours.\n\nIt's grown on me over the past few weeks and I am finding it very convenient to simply glance at it to see if the email/text is worth immediate attention.  Sending quick SMS/email replies is simple, either with the suggestions or (amazingly) the tiny keyboard.  Also, I get an SMS for dual layer authentication at work,12+ times a day, so that alone makes it very useful.  The speakerphone is OK only if you have HD voice.  I've toyed with some of the apps like Fit and Cardiogram.  They seem to do what they're supposed to do, but I was really in for the productivity. About the only complaint I have is the size of the crown/main button.  It's quite large and easy to press, so it's easy to accidentally depress any time I bend my wrist back, though wearing it a little higher on the wrist has helped.\n\nI'll edit if anything notable pops up, but for now I'll say that this was a very good choice at the price point.",

                "review_body": "I've been a wear OS (Android Wear) person pretty much since the first few watches came out.  I first got the Moto 360 and then the Huawei Watch and then the Huawei Watch 2.  In each instance, I've been fairly happy with the devices and the quality of the devices themselves.  Wear OS's problems are something else.  That's Google for you but given that I'm not a Samsung or Apple fan, I've done what I can to steer clear of those brands.\n\nMy last Wear OS watch was the Huawei Watch 2 and I got a full 2 years of use out of that one.  Towards the end, it started to act up but that coincided with the release of the Gen 5 and the subsequent sale on Black Friday.  I was waiting for that to happen, hoping to eek out a few more days and weeks from my Huawei watch.\n\nSo far, I've only had my Gen 5 for a couple of days.  It's hard to say how the battery life is after just those 2 days but I can say this.  The watch charges fast.  Real fast.  I was at 58% yesterday and I set it on the charger before I went to wash up for bed.  By the time I got back to the watch, it was fully charged.  That was maybe 30 minutes.  So I took the watch off the charger and I set it aside to see what the battery power would look like in the morning.  Not too shabby...it was at 91% this morning when I put it on.\n\nThe Huawei watch had 768MB of ram (IF memory serves correctly) but even with that, Wear OS was still sort of slow and glitchy.  The 1GB on the Gen 5 definitely makes a difference.  It still has moments when it glitches and slows a little but it's a lot better.  I don't have nearly as many moments.  The watch is much more responsive and I think I will enjoy getting Google Pay back.  For the most part, I would have to say the Gen 5 is very smooth and responsive.  Coming from those other watches, I have nothing to complain about.\n\nJust a comparison...I also recently bought my wife a Samsung Galaxy watch.  Yes, I went to Samsung for her but she also owns a Samsung phone and doesn't have the same feelings about Samsung as I.  She started using it on Friday and even though she is happy with it overall, her battery isn't doing any better than my Gen 5.  She did get the smaller 42mm version with the smaller battery but I've seen numerous reviews about it saying that they get about 2&1/2 days to even 3 days out of a charge.  The wife might swing 1&1/2 days which is on par with what I'm seeing with the Gen 5.  But I can say one thing...helping her setup of the Tizen OS based watch made me want to stick with my familiar Wear OS watch even more.  You can't undo 4+ years of familiarity with a particular brand.\n\nAbout the Gen 5, I really like the big main button with the spinning dial.  The galaxy watch has the spinning bezel.  This has the spinning dial and I think I like that more than the spinning bezel.  Google assistant pulls up fast and it listens pretty well.  I was having some issues having it text my wife but that's something I'll check on further.  But at least between my phone and my watch, if I need to rattle off a quick message to someone while driving, I can voice activate things and speak my message and get it done that way without taking my attention off the road.\n\nSo far, this watch has been everything that I wanted and hoped for.  I haven't tested the watch in water yet and I might not do that anytime too soon as I don't hit the water too often.  But I'm sure it's better than my Huawei watch and I took that into the pool a few times.\n\nFrom having my eye on this watch since it was announced to seeing it in store at a Fossil in Vegas and to finally getting it on my wrist, I can honestly say that this is the best Wear OS has to offer.  Fossil makes most of the watches with wear os.  The Emporio Armani Smartwatch 3 is a nice looking watch and it was just announced but I don't think it's worth the extra money.  The Gen 5 I think looks like a very nice watch.  It can work in any situation.  Much more versatile than my Huawei watch 2.\n\nUpdate:  I can definitely confirm that I love my gen 5. I've had it for a couple of weeks now. It feels so familiar to me but it runs so much smoother than all the previous watches. The battery life gets me a full day without any trouble. I'm using a watch face off the play store that gives me options to show on the screen. But even with this face and constant notifications all day, I'm somewhere between 45-60% after 16 hours. I could probably eek out 2 days in some situations but I'm an overnight charging person anyways so why bother trying for it... This is the best of wear os until the new chip gets released and maybe, something from Google gets released now that they own fitbit.",

My smartphone is always on me, so advanced functions are still taken care of.\n\nI love having my watch alert me and give me basic information like who is calling/texting. This feels just like my other Fossils too.\n\nThe battery is expected to last a year, but the replacement is about $1-2 and the tool to open the back comes with the watch. Fossil will replace it for free too!\n\nPro:\nDesign\nUsability\nDon't have to ever charge\nQuick recognition of iPhone information\n\nCon:\nReplace the battery yearly (approximately)\nNot very waterproof\nReports of the step tracker not working very accurately\nLimited number of alert notifications\nOther models (like my wife's Accomplice) don't share the same number of features",

Setting up my Fossil Q was as easy as downloading the app and following the instructions - it took only a few seconds for my mobile device to find and pair with my watch. It was kind of fun watching the hands move around as it set the correct time (entirely on its own). There was a brief exercise using onscreen buttons to calibrate the watch, although truth be told I didn't need to make any adjustments.  The band is comfortable and easy to use - it has a push button release on the back.  I will probably end up removing a link or two though as the fit is looser than I like. There are three buttons on the side of the watch for enabling smartwatch features. The features are limited, but useful. You can control music playback, receive vibrating messages, notifications, select contacts for expedited calling. It also has some health tracking features, like a step counter and a sleep monitor.  I suspect that, like many other software driven items, the feature set will grow with time.",

Low-key meaning that it is mostly meant to be a nice-looking, fashionable watch but it is still able to pair with your phone to offer some smartwatch-like capabilities. The most obvious difference from most traditional smartwatches is that there is no digital screen nor any lighting. Unlike some of the other Fossil smartwatches, this model has no USB charger and you need to change the battery like a traditional watch. It does include a \"Q\" shaped key to let you access the battery, but it can also be opened with a coin. It was kind of cool to see the dials move very fast during the pairing - this process is basically to let you know that the phone has successfully paired to your phone via bluetooth. Just keep in mind that you will need to download an app on your smartphone in order to take advantage of this function. It is able to count the number of steps that you take, but this is probably not intricate enough for sporting activity - just for general daily walking. It also has a sleep quality monitor, but I personally don't think that this watch is comfortable for sleeping. I would also mention that this watch is on the heavy side - which I personally like but some people might not.",

Fossil is a worldwide brand who has leveraged its ingenuity in watchmaking to launch Fossil Q, an innovative line of hybrid smart watches. I believe the Q Grant is the perfect watch for today's lifestyle.\n\nI like that Fossil respects the artistry and tradition of fine watchmaking. The stainless steel construction and intricate design makes a very favorable impression, indeed.  The twist is that unlike my grandfather's watch, I can connect the Q Grant to the Fossil Q app on my smartphone; opening up some very interesting and useful possibilities.\n\nTo begin, I downloaded the Fossil Q app to both my tablet and iPhone. Pairing the watch took only a few moments.  When complete, the time hands on the watch automatically moved to the time indicated on my tablet (I presume this auto sync will eliminate the daylight savings time hassle going forward, too).  I found the very clean, uncluttered interface of the Q app to be intuitive and easy to use.\n\nThe Fossil Q app allows me to use the Q Grant to track my sleep, steps and fitness goals. The app can also be used to set alarms. A press of the button on the lower right can be used to stop/play music, ring the phone and take photos.  I think it's simply an elegant solution to making online technologies accessible when using a device of high integrity.\n\nI've attached a selfie to this review that I took with the Q Grant. All I did was set my iPhone on a table with the camera app open. Then I pressed the button on the Q Grant. Snap - my iPhone captured the moment!  What a great way to take photos virtually hands-free.\n\nFusing the best of old and new technologies, I highly recommend Fossil's innovative Q Grant smart watch to everyone.",

Until now, he has used an app on his phone for tracking his steps - he doesn't want to wear a typical fitness tracker, but loves knowing he's walked his five miles every day.  Thus, this big manly-looking watch is absolutely perfect for him.\n\nThis smart watch pairs with your phone and is able to notify you about texts and emails from the contacts you choose. It will also track your sleep habits if you want it to and  lets you set up goals and check them off if you're so inclined.  It's easy to connect the watch to your phone - you just download the app and get going.\n\nThis chrome and black watch, with its dual-tone stainless steel wristband, is heavy and solid on your wrist, which is exactly what my guy likes.  The face has Roman numerals. It's good-sized but the lack of contrast makes it hard to see for older eyes, especially at night. That's the only reason I knocked off a star.\n\nThe watch operates on a battery, not a USB charger, but the great thing is that you can change the battery yourself - it even comes with a little tool to open the battery compartment. All in all, it's a beautiful watch if you are into traditional analog timepieces with the added smart features.",

It was a bit too big for me at first but I easily took out a couple of links and now it fits really well. It was packaged beautifully and came with everything I needed.\n\nI do enjoy the smart feature of being alerted with the hand movements whenever my friends or family are texting or calling me. It's a really cool feature that I haven't seen on any other watch.\n\nMy main complaint with this watch is that it is not backlit, making it very difficult to read. I would not buy this again unless a light were added.",

                "review_body": "I've enjoyed using a fitness tracker, but it didn't function as well as a watch.\n\nIf you are considering this watch, it's likely you want it for the watch feature and look first, and as a fitness tracker second, but there's a feature in the watch that's hardly mentioned but that owners of this style of watch are likely to find very useful.\n\nIt's called Goal Tracking.\n\nYes, the watch can track the traditional steps and sleep, but it can also tracks Goals. It's one of the three sections (see screenshot).\n\nAt first it seemed like it was just fitness goals, but no. You customize the goal. One example they give is \"Say hello to someone new today.\" You perform your goal, and then you press the lower button on the watch and it catalogs that you achieved you goal.\n\nNow for professionals and executives, this can be a very powerful tool. Say you want to accomplish a certain task each day. This could be related to work (spend 30 minutes sharpening the saw, for example), or spend 10 mindfulness minutes, Spend 30 minutes writing, or make a sales call, etc.\n\nPoint is, you can customize the goal, and then each time you reach the goal, you can track it by pressing the button. I thought it would be silly, but it's one of my favorite features.\n\nNow on to the other features\n\n-- Adjusting the links --\n\nThe watch does not come with a link adjuster, just FYI. So to remove a link to adjust the band size, you'll need a link adjuster tool.\n\nThe watch does come with a tool (in the shape of a Q) that can be used to remove the battery casing.\n\n-- Face Size --\n\nThis is a large watch, and it took some getting used to, but I like it.\n\n-- Coloring --\n\nThe grey background as well as the grey hands blend together a little when making a quick glance to the watch. I've gotten used to it, and overall the look is elegant. It'd be interesting to see if other owners feel the same. The minute hand is colored orange at the tip as well as the step indicator. so that helps.\n\n-- No Light --\n\nMy biggest regret is that the watch doesn't have a light. Really wish it had that. The hands do glow in the dark, but it's pretty subtle.\n\n-- As a Fitness Tracker --\n\nThe steps are accurate as far as I can tell. It's different from my other fitness tracker, but after counting steps for a bit, the Fossil Q seems pretty accurate.\n\nThe step data can import into the Apple Health App but as of this writing, the Sleep Data cannot. Maybe they'll get that fixed. Accuracy here was similar to my fitness tracker when tested against each other.\n\nI love that at a quick glance, I can see the progress of my fitness goal from 0% achieved to 100%. I don't have to press any buttons to see progress.\n\nIt helps me be more conscious of my fitness goal because I immediately see my progress with each look at the watch.\n\n-- Other Features --\n\nThe watch can be used as an alarm, with a press of one of the buttons, you can view the date, or even another time from a time zone you select which is handy if you need to do business with a company in another time zone or on the other side of the world.\n\nThe watch vibration notifications can be adjusted in strength. The lowest setting is almost imperceptible. You can set vibration notifications for texts and calls, but for me, that's not as handy. I don't need something to connect me to calls and texts. The fitness and goal tracking are the most beneficial features for my use, but the other features are there if you want them.\n\n-- The App --\n\nI was surprised by the elegant design of the app. Good job on that, Fossil. I haven't noticed errors or crashing in use with an iPhone.\n\n-- Do I miss my separate Fitness Tracker Watch? --\n\nNo. I've found myself using this watch exclusively throughout the day.\n\nIt's a great blend of tradition, style, and function.\n\n-- Two Word --\n\nLove it.",

                "review_body": "This is a really nice looking watch with a big face, which I like. It has the watch feel that one wants. Although this watch weighs 6 ounces, which in my book is on the heavy side. Out of the box it easily sync'd with my phone so from there all I had to do was use the features on my phone to talk to my watch. We were curious how this would be a smart watch and show its use. If the face showing analog and will switch to a digital face? If so cool! The answer is no. The watch itself tells you the time and the day. It will notify you of alarms you have set on your phone. It will control the volume on your phone and you can set it up to work with your phones camera to take pictures. Which is pretty cool. But most communication is done with your device. Removing links to adjust size was easily done as well as the smaller adjustments in the band coupling. So after making size adjustments and syncing it to my phone I started to play with it. I'm really curious about the step counter. My phone has one inside so that went in the back pocket and the watch on the wrist. The numbers didn't match, not even slightly. One has to be moving their arms in order to get the step counter to register steps. The problem with that is if you are working on something that requires a lot of hand movements it over counts your steps. But on the other hand if you spend your time hauling stuff to and fro with your hands then your steps will not be counted. I'm sure it all comes out in the wash with an active day. My last observation is the crystal, it is tinted a smokey tint. Which makes it harder to see in darker rooms and at night. The hands are glow in the dark which helps if you a bit. There is no backlight to illuminate the face for viewing.\n\nI like the watch but it is much heavier than I would like and was hoping the \"smartwatch\" capabilities would be better. It is a nice dress watch though and has that classic analog look we like. I do wonder about the battery and how often I will need to change it.",

                "review_body": "This is my first foray into smart watches, and I have some issues.  Let\u2019s start with the basic concept.  As smart watches go, this one is pretty minimal.  I am an analog guy, and this is an analog watch, which is the only reason I would consider it.  So, its smart watch functions are minimal.  Mostly, it is a health tracker.  The main issue with it as a health tracker is its weight.  In order for a watch to work as a health tracker, you have to wear it consistently, and a watch of this weight just doesn\u2019t work in that capacity.  Fit bits work because they are so light that people will just wear them all the time.  I won\u2019t because I want a real watch.  I prefer lighter watches these days, though, and with something of this weight, which is heavier than the truly slim, minimalist watches I like these days, I certainly won\u2019t wear it constantly.  I will take it off when I get home from work, and won\u2019t put it on until I leave in the morning, and that defeats a lot of the purpose.  If a heavier watch is not something you will wear 24/7, then this won\u2019t work as a fitness tracker for you.\n\nOther than the fitness tracker, its \u201csmart\u201d capacities are minimal.  It will notify you of texts and emails from selected contacts, and the hands on the dial will rotate in a coded way to show you who is trying to contact you.  That\u2019s about it.  That isn't the most efficient way to convey information, and that doesn't really impress me.  Other than that, it\u2019s a big, heavy-ish watch.  It's not one of those gargantuan monstrosities, but a while ago, Vine gave me one of those nice, slim little Lucien Piccard things that I often wear, and in terms of weight, there just isn't any comparison.\n\nAlso, keep in mind the metal band problem.  Metal bands have an intrinsic \u201crounding error\u201d problem with regard to the size of your wrist.  You have to remove a fixed number of whatdoyoucallems, and the band will likely be either too tight or too loose.  If it is too loose, you may not get the best readings.  I didn\u2019t think much of the readings I saw, particularly the step tracker.\n\nDo I have anything positive to say?  It\u2019s a nice-looking watch.  Good feel, and actually, the band release is kind of cool.  On its own, this is a decent watch.  Worth wearing, and my wife says that it works as a decent, not-too-dressy kind of thing.  I'll have to trust her judgment on that.  I just don\u2019t think much of the smart features, given the weight, and my unwillingness to wear it at all times.  However, the price is based on the smart features, making this, in my opinion, overpriced.  But, that depends for you on how heavy a watch you like.  I like slim, light watches.  If that isn't you, then go for it.\n\nIf you are willing to wear a heavier watch at all times, and want an analog watch that does step-tracking, etc., then this is probably a good choice for you.  However, this is not the droid I was looking for.",

It looks awesome and most of the features are amazing BUT if you are looking for this to be an accurate Activity Tracker then DO NOT WASTE your money.  I wore this side by side with My Fitbit charge and tested against a 3rd Device(IPhone 6s).  Both the Fitbit and IPhone were very close to one another.  The Fossil Q Grant Gen 2 was horrrriiiiiiibleeee.  Its not even close.  I would walk 3 miles and the Fossil q would be off more than a mile(2000 +steps).  I worked with Fossil to exchange the watch because no way the watch could be that far off.  Once I received the replacement I still saw the huge discrepancy in step calculation.  Text notifications and linking the watch to the phone to control your music on the IPhone work great.  I cant say how disappointed I was with the Fitness Tracker portion though, VERY POOR JOB.",

Wore the watch and my wife's Fitbit blaze for a walk (on the same arm) and the difference in steps was incredible. This watch only logged about 2500 steps to the blaze's more accurate 6500 steps. (Distance confirmed via GPS and driving the route.)\n\nAdditionally, shortly after the \"support window\" had closed, the glass bezel broke. A huge crack right through the center of the dial. I have had a lot of watches from many different brands and I have NEVER cracked the bezel before, even with much rougher wear and over longer periods of time. Now I'm stuck with a broken watch that doesn't log my activity properly.\n\nPros: Bluetooth notifications work, especially handy when I walk away from my phone, I know when I've missed a call or text.\n  Stylish, minus the cracked bezel\n\nCons: step count is inaccurate\n  Bezel inexplicably cracked after 2.5 months of occasional, daytime wear\n  Return/warranty period too short\n\nOverall, I'm disappointed with this purchase and would NOT recommend this watch.",

So I came across the concept of a \"hybrid watch\" here.\n\nPros:\n*Looks and feels like a real fossil watch, not a silly gadget\n*The pedometer seems to be pretty accurate (until your battery gets low - see cons)\n*The app is very detailed about the types of steps and sleeps you get\n*You can set multiple app notifications to a single digit alert (I have Messenger, Text, and WhatsApp all on 1 for example)\n*YOU DO NOT NEED TO CHARGE THE THING AT ALL!!! (I literally only take my watch off to shower)\n\nCons:\n*No illuminating watch hands - this is the biggest gripe honestly. The watch has a naturally dark background, so if you are in a poor lit or even dark room, you will not be seeing anything on this watch.\n*The App regularly crashes the first time I load it (Samsung Note 9), but works fine after loading it again.\n*There is no clear indication when to replace the battery. I went 7 months before replacing mine, however about 5 months in my pedometer went nuts and started registering an insane amount of steps. No other issues with the watch whatsoever. I finally decided to replace the battery issue and the pedometer is back to normal again. So I guess the crazy pedometer registers is your best indication to swap out that battery.\n\nSummary:\nOverall, I love the watch simply because I do not care for charging of smart watches at all when all I like are the notifications and pedometer, which these hybrid watches have without the need to regularly charge them.\n\nI would definitely recommend a hybrid watch to anyone that does not need all the extra bells and whistles on their wrist, but still would like those added amenities mentioned above.",

This is exactly what i have been wanting.\n\nThe battery is easily replaced and lasts quite a while actually. The bands were easy to fit to my wrist (you need a watch repair kit for this).\n\nThe watch face is easy to read and can be calibrated for precision.\n\nOverall a great watch, i was skeptical having had a couple smart watches before.

Those  seem gross and rather grade-schoolesk in my opinion and that coupled with  square primitive digital readout looked like smart watches for dummies and why I haven't been inclined to consider a smart watch until this .  Others commonly look generic and are simply  a dime a dozen.  This watch stands far outside of any smartwatch I've encountered. I collect regular Fossil watches this one will be the star that never sees the inside of the watch box on my dresser. Self charging! That's amazing.. Like we need another device to charge. Fossil hybrid offering the style and luxury and the look and feel that others lacked all the while integrating the technology capabilities that are almost required of our accessories in this ever advancing \"smart\"  device  modern world.\nThis watch and its unique style and intricate gears shown in the face are eye catching.  It looks more expensive than it was. This is a great gift for a gadget loving guy who has everything. Just got it so learning the features will update later. Very pleased so far.",

Thought it would be convenient to have it notify me of a caller when I'm walking the dog and may not want to stop to get the phone out of my pocket. Very glad I didn't go all out. It syncs to my phone just fine, but the advertised battery life must be when it is in power saving mode and who wants that all the time. I maybe get half a day and the power is so low that it gives me a notice to put in power saving mode. I followed the directions by charging completely before using for the first time, too. It's a nice watch but I could have just kept using my Fitbit.",

The messaging, notifications, voice system, and multiple functions have all met my expectations. The battery life is great as well with light usage such as notifications and reminders.  It definitely rivals the Apple watch and other competitors.  So for I haven't had any issues with it and it's been worked flawlessly.  I'd definitely consider purchasing it if you're into the smartwatch market!",

Battery is no where near as good as the time steel but that's to be expected considering the plethora of features this watch has.\nMy only real complaint here is the fact that if you wear it daily, expect the bezel to scratch and scuff fairly easily which has unfortunately already happened to mine.\nIn order to remedy this I went and bought a protective silicone/rubber protective case from Spigen and hopefully it'll do the job.",

It's simply a massively underwhelming sports watch. Once or twice it didn't even keep the activity I did and saved. The heart-rate monitor is terrible, but most wrist-measuring watches are, so I can't complain too much about that. The watch itself, despite being tight on my wrist, wobbles about when I am mountain biking and actually hurts me. Samsung's own Health app is useless.  I had a Garmin before which has a whole massively detailed online portal where you can see everything you've done and overlay it with Google Maps etc. Samsung has no online portal at all and looking at it on your phone is basic at best. Despite all the reviews it's not all that easy to use as a smart watch.  It's too small for starters.  Samsung's original smart watch was much better looking IMO and square, which makes sense.  Round may look better in some devices, but is totally stupid and impractical for a smart watch. The dial on the front works well most of the time to move between screens, but if that's the way to measure a smart watch then it's just sad. I've yet to see a smart watch with any real use.  Better to get a sports watch which has some rudimentary smart features than a smart watch with some rudimentary sports features.  Complete waste of money",

Nope, Nope, Nope!\n-NFC Payments requires use of Samsung Pay, and a Samsung account to track my history. NOPE!\n-No Google Fit - Requires 'Samsung Health', and a Samsung account.\n-Price is stratospheric for a device locked into crap software.\n\nPROS:\n- Hardware was light, dial was smooth, screen was nice.\n\nEssentially, this watch is a marketing angle to get you into bed with Samsung account related software.

I just can't say the hardware was properly designed with the problems I've been experiencing.\n\nNow, just a few months later, I'm having to send the device in again since the battery won't last longer than 8 hours on \"low-power mode.\" Why should I be acting as a Beta tester when this watch is already in production!? After sleuthing the message boards, I found multiple complaints from other customers with the same device. All Samsung had been responding with was \"turn off the features [you paid for] to increase the battery life.\" Very helpful, Samsung. You guys really know how to make a customer feel valued.\n\nWhen I purchased this watch I was expecting a complete product and better performance for the money I spent. Strangely enough, Samsung's return policy is not longer than about a month. Funny how things have a tendency to fall apart after the warranty expires. Now I realize I shouldn't expect much out of Samsung's wearables \u00af\\_(?)_/\u00af. If I ever do go with another smart watch, I'll be steering clear of anything Samsung. Buyer beware.",

One downside I encountered was that after a year of use, the sensor became loose and didn't stay in place. This caused the watch to think I wasn't wearing it, so it kept locking me out and was no longer usable.",

Tried charging it when in the shower but it doesnt charge fast enough in 30 minutes. I use it mainly for pulse monitoring and fitness tracking.",

The Galaxy app offers very limited accessibility to features on the phone where the app on a Samsung device offers much much more.\nThe App Store is a hot mess. While searching directly for a particular app the App Store would fail to find it, however that same app could be found by scrolling through the App Store.\nWiFi connectivity is shoddy at best. The Auto WiFi feature would never switch from a Bluetooth connection to WiFi, you have to completely disable Bluetooth on your phone to force the watch to connect to WiFi (for faster downloads).\nWhen you turned Bluetooth back on, the watch would not connect again without you disabling the auto WiFi connection.\nAnother huge disappointment is that Samsung Galaxy only works within its own ecosystem- exactly what Apple products tend to do. You cannot control your Google Home through this watch. You can use Google Assistant to control SmartThings, but no google devices are available to connect to SmartThings.\nThis product has so much potential but fails to live up to it.",

Something is running in the background and I can't find out what.  I have made no tweaks to the watch other than changing the face.  Lately it has gone one step further.  It loses its face, loses its settings, will not reconnect to the phone, basically requires a power down and back up.  That does fix it, IF you can get the power down icon to work -- and it doesn't always work.  But by then it is down to 40% charge so you can't finish the day with it.  I have searched all tech documents for solutions and have found none.  Finally, today, when I could not even see the time on the thing, I removed the special steel mesh band I put on (which is very nice) and did another reboot of the watch.  With my 16 ounce claw hammer.  I'll say this -- I could only smash the crystal.  The case survived all my attempts to reboot it.  But, it is now thoroughly dead and in the bottom of the trash can.  This is not the first watch I have linked to the Galaxy phone.  Every other one had issues as well.  I don't think Samsung phones, and I like them, have got the techie stuff worked out yet for dealing with watches.  As much as I loathe and despise Apple products (I am a retired I.T. Director and software engineer, BTW) I have to admit that my wife's Apple watch and her iPhone do work together.  But I will go back to my nice Bulova quartz watch.

The rest of the features are mostly the same in terms of things I care about, although I'm still poking around. But most likely I'm going to end up returning this and keeping my Gear S2 classic for a little while longer.",

Even though they're small it still bugs me. Otherwise the Galaxy watch is great. It has amazing battery life and that's one of the biggest highlights. If you need a good smartwatch with good battery life, get this watch.

The battery life easily lasts me a full day with about 40-50% to spare.  The rotating dial makes navigating the watch way easier and more intuitive to use than Wear OS watches.\n\nUnfortunately, despite years of complaints on various internet forums Samsung watches still lack basic podcast functionality.  There is still no TIzen app with native support for downloading podcasts directly to the watch.  Spotify comes closest and lets you download music onto the watch but not podcasts for some reason.  Instead in order to listen to podcasts while working out without your phone you have to go through a convoluted workaround which involves saving podcasts to the music folder of your phone then manually copying files on your phone or restarting your phone in order to get the Galaxy Wearable app to see new files that can then be transferred.  You also have to use an app like Pocketcasts which has an option to save podcasts in a format other apps can read.\n\nIf you have an Android phone Samsung watches are still significantly better than Wear OS in terms of design and ease of use, but still held back by the lack of apps for Tizen and Samsung refusing for some reason to fill the gaps in the basic functionality they lack by making their own apps.",

I was always scared of getting the S2 wet and having it die on me.\n2) Larger bezel screen to make navigating easier\n3) The battery seems to last longer, however since I have the Dislay options on high its hard to notice so far, but I think it will last at least 8-9 hours more than the S2.\n4) The whole case and appearance make it look more durable and resistable to damage.\n\nGood work Samsung!",

Several way to supposedly change it, but none stick.\n\nThird, I want the face to go off after 10 seconds or so and then wake up when I twist my wrist or move my arm. I do no want to have to use my other hand to tap something. I keep making the change, but it doesn't stick...possibly a result of the password crap mentioned above.\n\nAt this point I'm 1) kinda liking the thing. 2) Almost ready to take a ball pein hammer to it and toss it in the junk pile. and 3) why can't Samsung get the software right?

The main reason I would wear this over a nice analog watch is for fitness.  Its heart rate monitoring is terrible.  I have it set to constant auto monitoring but it only does it when I'm not moving, about once an hour at best.  It never works when I'm actually moving or exercising.  When I attempt to do a force measure when working out it gives an error every time about clean sensor.  If I'm sweating at all it will not work, kinda defeats the purpose. My ancient fitbit HR did 10x better on heart monitoring and it knew when I was working out even without logging it. This galaxy watch doesn't even know when I try to log it.  It just uses my heart rate from earlier in day and thinks I've done a few steps. I've tried everything short of shaving my arm hair to improve it.  I'm throwing in the towel.  It's pointless as a fitness watch, especially if you are doing any calorie counting like myfitnesspal.\n\nIt's a decent smart watch but lacks a way to type using hand drawn characters like iwatch, so unless a canned response works or you can use voice, you can't respond on watch.\n\nThe battery life is no where near what is advertised. I have to charge mine daily.  The only thing it does amazingly well is track sleep but if you wear it at night it will not last but a day on power.\n\nIt does keep me off my phone and informed during meetings and court without drawing any attention, but it's pointless without reliable fitness tracking.  I'm not sold yet on the my fitness health app from Samsung either.\n\nUPDATE: After a few program updates nothing has changed.  If anything it's worse. Sometimes when I look at the heart rate readings I see they are from 2 days ago.  I cannot stress enough, do not buy this for fitness, buy it for smart watch features only.  I wish I could have returned this watch but by the time I figured out how bad it was as a fitness watch the return window closed.  I love love Samsung products (phones, tv's, tablets, etc) but hate to say it, this is the biggest Samsung disappointment ever (and I used to have the exploding Note 7).

I thought that watch was great with good battery and quick response. Now that I've tried the Galaxy watch I realize how much better things have gotten. When always on is turned off I finish the day around 80% battery. That up at 5:30am and to bed by 111:00. I have the 42 mm version that has a smaller battery. With the Huawei watch I'd get maybe a day. I really did not want to turn off the always on because on the Huawei I had to shake my hand to get it to turn the display back on. Not so with the Galaxy. The screen activates every time. I was also concerned about lack of Google Wear OS. That hasn't been an issue at all. Granted I use this watch to monitor steps, sleep, tell time, and look cool. The waterproof feature was a big seller to me as well. And the readability outdoors blows the Huawei out of the water. I am seriously enjoying this watch. Couple that will the cool dial interface and you got a winner in my book.",

Although it still is a thick watch, every smart watch is going to be relatively thick compared to normal watches as well. I think you'd have to have a very large wrist to warrant the 46mm (or you might want the bigger screen/battery).\n\nI don't find the shortage of third-party apps in TizenOS to be restrictive. I mostly use the watch to track my runs, and view notifications without needing to access my phone. I can't imagine what else I would need.\n\nThe battery life is okay. I get about 1 full day with my current setup: brightness at 2, always on display, location off, heart-rate every 10 minutes. I put the watch on before bed, then charge it the evening of the next day (~16-20 hours of use).\n\nI think this is currently the best smart watch out there for Android phones.

Now on this new version The gps on it can track my location and the speaker can announce information during my runs; handy stuff. Even though the apps on the appstore are 90% useless, the ones that are useful are AMAZING. To me a smartwatch is 1st a watch and second a piece of gear that SUPPLEMENTS your phone. I dont need to play games on my watch, look at pictures, watch youtube, and surf the internet from my watch; to me thats stupid. What i do need are little apps that help me get through the day rather than pulling out my phone which would actually be more time consuming; this watch is GREAT at doing that.

I start using it at 7:30 and when its 23:00 the battery is already at less than 15%.\n\nAlso, the music controller on the exercise screen of the Samsung Health app doesn't work (but its a software bug, easy to repair). The Spotify app (in Remote mode, using connected to smartphone) is not working at the moment of this review too (but its also just a software issue).\n\nOooh, and don't expect to have a lot of beautiful watch faces on your watch unless you're willing to pay for them.

It's bulkier than the Versa, the battery takes longer to charge and doesn't last as long (this latter has been a disappointment after reading the reviews), but the big screen is easier to read and I think I will like the rotating bezel, which, if nothing else, acts as a bit of a protection for the screen ... and that's a good thing because given its larger size I have been bumping it into everything (and to think I was contemplating the 46mm!)  It has been staying reliably connected to my phone (S8), which is good because notifications is one of the primary reasons I wear a watch these days. All in all, I'm pleased ...

Not sure if I will even care in the coming weeks. but pretty neat at the moment.\n\nHowever, I have a few minor issues I don't like and perhaps I will overcome them as I get more familiar with the watch.\n\nText messages\nI have a Samsung Galaxy S8 and if I read my text messages on my watch, my phone does not mark the message as ready. I am using Google messages, so maybe its not compatible. But in my 2015 car I can read the message on the infotainment center and it gets acknowledged. Its not too big of a deal, but in my opinion, it kinda of defeats the purpose of using your watch.\n\nNotifications\nI have disabled most of the notifications I don't want to see. But I have not figured out how to disable the daily briefings, or when my phone is out of range (it vibrates) or some various other apps on the phone.\n\nGoodnight mode\nI love the goodnight mode feature. It seems to recognize when its getting close to bedtime, giving you the option to enable or suspend. But it does not always recognize when I get up. I find half the time I have to turn it off.\n\nBattery life\nI know the 42 has the smaller battery, but I am a little disappointed with the life so far.

Measure your stress levels quite accurately, be able to see how long/well you sleep, calories, steps, and lots lots more in regards to health/calories/fitness. I was pleasantly surprised by the ease of navigating throughout the watch and it is quite nice to have it connected with my phone so when I get a text it pops up on my watch and I can quickly see who sent what and reply if needed. There are SO many faces available that you can choose from, I saw one from Fallout and it looked pretty awesome so I used that but there are literally hundreds of them. In terms of battery life it is not that great around two days maximum, but that's not necessarily bad unless you are constantly using your watch for fitness which tends to drain the battery quite fast. On an average of use it has gone from 100 to 70% with me, so technically speaking if you don't plan on using this so much for fitness tracking it can last up to 3 days without charging. The Samsung Pay feature is great as well I have both of my cards on there and if I need to pay I just put my wrist next to the credit card scanner machine and press pay. You can also download/play music on it or control the music on your phone, useful is you have headphones on and don't want to take your phone out and just scroll through quickly on your watch to the wanted song.

So that being said if you are used to having something on your wrist all the time I definitely highly recommend this watch especially if you have a Samsung Galaxy phone. the battery was impressive for how much is going on in this little thing. it would last about 2 days and comes with a wireless charger that will get you 100% in about an hour.

                "review_body": "This watch growth on me. First day I wanted to give it 3 stars, second day I started to kind of like it, and from third day I am mostly loving it.\n\nPros:\n* First non-Apple non-gigantic smartwatch that fits OK on my somewhat small wrist.\n* Easy to disable all unnecessary notifications and make the watch unintrusive\n* User interface seems very optimized. You don't need to do many clicks to get where you need. For me 95% of my needs are met on two screens - the watch face and swipe to the right for weather. That's it.\n* Love the choice of watch faces and that you can fit time, fitness and weather (with some limitations) on one screen\n* Fitness functions seem to work fine. Nice to be able to see your your speed and route on the map when you bike.\n\nNeutral\n* Battery lasts reliably two days. It can probably do 2.5 days total. Kind of same as the 1st gen Apple watch I had some years back.\n\nCons / to improve:\n* Making it thinner would be nice. It is still a brick on your hand. Although for the fairness Samsung made it fairly elegant, but didn't do as good of a job of hiding thickness as apple did.\n* Custom watch faces do not seem to include weather. I suspect some API limitations making weather unavailable to 3rd party developers.\n* I wish some watch faces included not just current temperature, but also high and low for the day.\n* Bixby speaks in a ridiculous computer voice, which no longer feels normal in the age of Alexa, Siri and Google Assistant, but is otherwise functional (e.g. I found it to be the simplest way to start timer when I do meditation).\n\nI hope many further improvements will come via software updates.",

Its under warranty(what I assumed since it literally just went bad over night)Yay!!\nFilled out the online form included the picture.\n24h later a customer representative called me,gave me via email the shipping instructions.\nShipped it off. Everything went smoothly, even customer service was great.\nA week later I get a email saying I need to pay approximately 150$??.\nI called them right away,asking why do I need to pay if it's under warranty.\nShe said because of water damage/ abuse it doesn't fall under warranty.\nWater damage??? This watch is supposed to be waterproof!!! Even tho it didn't got in contact with water(I always took it off for showers and such).\nSo I argued with her for a minute about it and after I noticed I wouldn't win this battle I gave in and paid since it's just a fraction of the cost of a new one.\nI'm just very upset that they claim it was \"water damage/ abuse\",pretty much my fault... what was not....I just charged it.\nI personally think it's a way for them to get away not to pay for it.\nI talked to a couple friends about that issue, they own a apple watch....2 of them had similar issues and apple did the same to them.\nIts frustrating because I love my watch.\nYou can clearly see in the picture that the screen has no crack ,that this was a faulty screen.\nSamsung you need to do a better job,take care of your customers!!",

                "review_body": "I bought my first Android smartphone in 2009, the MyTouch 3G.  It was the second android to hit the main market.  It never should have.\n\nThe technology was too immature.  It lacked the power to run all of the functionality it was supposed to have.  Often, when I would receive a phone call, the phone was SO laggy that the call would go to voicemail before the phone could let me answer it.  It was... gimmicky.  A smartphone, yes, but not really all that smart.\n\nI feel similarly about the Galaxy Watch.  What does it really do besides be a smartwatch, by definition?  There were a few apps that were useful.  \"Find my phone\" was nice.  The apps for weather and such were also useful, but really not any easier than pulling out my phone.  I could send quick text responses, which was an upgrade over my previous wearable, a Fitbit Charge 2.\n\nIt was slow.  It would lag when it was doing nothing, processing nothing.  I would pull down the menu to put it into sleep mode, and it would lag when I did that, and when I pressed the button for sleep mode.  Why was it lagging?  It wasn't doing anything!  It wasn't sending or receiving data.  It wasn't even opening an app.  It lagged because it was evidently underpowered for even the performance of its most basic task, showing a watch face.\n\nBattery life:  less than advertised.  If I let it run down to zero, it might last a day, a day and a few hours tops.  As it was, I would go to bed with it fully charged and it would easily run down to 78% overnight, on sleep mode.  And folks, let me tell you, I don't sleep long nights.  This, by the way, was with the setting on infrequent heart rate monitoring.  Speaking of heart rate monitoring, let's move on to my main reason for wanting a smart wearable, activity tracking.\n\nIt was ok at this.  It would count steps fine, and would automatically detect when I was on a walk or doing something else it considered exercise for ten minutes or more.  The display of fitness data was pretty.\n\nIt is garbage at tracking floors climbed.  I was lucky if it detected 1/4 of the floors climbed on any given day.  Samsung has been made aware of this, and thus far has basically shrugged its shoulders about it.  Sleep tracking was subpar.  Several nights, it failed to track sleep at all, and when it does track sleep, the data is very basic.\n\nIn the end, it's less functional at the things I prioritize and basically is only good at looking pretty and being high maintenance.  That's right, the Galaxy watch was effectively like a bad girlfriend or boyfriend*.\n\nAnyway, I dumped it and instead bought the newer generation of my old fitbit, the Charge 3.  I now enjoy much better fitness tracking, dramatically superior battery life, and hey, the new fitbit can even send quick text responses, so now that's covered.  It was $130 cheaper and all I've really sacrificed is style points.",

It will drain your battery within hours because it constantly runs in the background without even using it. Hang up a call? Auto play Spotify. Mess with anything audio? Opens Spotify! I was stoked about this feature, but Samsung/Spotify really need to step up their game.\n\nThere's a little lag between receiving texts/calls and having the content show up on your watch, but overall this feature is about as good as I expected. Making and taking calls from my wrist is fantastic. Facebook messenger notifications do not show up.\n\nBattery life, after uninstalling Spotify and resetting the watch is actually darn good. I can run a third party sleep tracker all night, track my training for several hours, and it's only at about 60% thereafter.\n\nIt sits a little funny on my tiny wrists. (5'4, 108lbs). I've tried right side up and upside down, but it's just weird- maybe that's me, though. A lot of times, turning my wrist to activate the watch face doesn't work... a lot of times it'll do it when I don't want it to. Little frustrating. Best bet is to forget set it to \"always on\" and very dim, or \"always off\", and press the home button to see it.\n\nHeart rate tracker seems to be fairly accurate, but the watch is always telling me to slide it further up my arm. If I put it any further up, it'd be at my elbow. I'm an acrobat and have decent sized forearm muscles, so keeping it in place is difficult and a little inhibiting. I've tried flipping it upside down, no dice. Sometimes it just drops your HR and fills in the blanks with guesses.\n\nGPS is hit or miss, but I'm in a rural area so take that with a grain of salt.\n\nI'd say if you're looking for a decent balance between smart/fitness, this is about what you can expect. Smart watches and fitness trackers alike still leave a bit to be desired in 2018, and it seems no one watch has it all down pat.\n\n*****ONE MONTH UPDATE*****\nIt's been a month now of daily use for sleep taking, weightlifting, running, yoga, and acrobatics practice.\n\nI've taken away two stars because the heartrate tracker is just awful and unreliable. I don't know if it's because of my forearm anatomy that I mentioned in my initial review or because Samsung just really needs to up their game. My skin in basically translucent, and I adjust the watch whenever it says I need to scoot it up my arm a bit further, yet still it simply is not capable of tracking my heartrate when I am in or above my target/vigorous/max zone.\n\nI've provided a picture of my data from yesterday's 5.5 mile trail run where you can clearly see that as soon as my HR was where I wanted it to be, the watch dropped it and lost it completely for nearly three entire remainder of my run. This means that the calories burned is inaccurate, and I don't have good info to go on to plan my next run. I came home with an exertion migraine, and although I'm not blaming that on the watch, it would have been nice to know that I was overdoing it a bit.\n\nThis is REALLY frustrating, and I'm considering returning the watch at this point.\n\nI still have issues with the face waking up when I look at it, too, and don't want to set it to \"always on\".",

I dont have to pull out my phone to answer a text or to make a call i can see and answer them from my watch.  I can also make calls from the watch.  I have only used the watch for running so far and the metrics look good and I can control the music from my watch.\n\nThe 42mm watch is large for my very tiny wrists but still comfortable.  I really like the rotating bezel to find apps etc.  My garmin 735xt was out for repair so i ordered this for the calling features but my first impression is that garmin is still better for tracking sports.  Also I like to do sprint tris and the samsung galaxy wont track a tri.  I also love that my 735xt battery lasts for 7 days or so.  The galaxy seems like I will need to charge it every night.  Its a much more attractive watch than the 735xt and i like the barometer and altimeter.\n\nI was considering the fenix 5s plus because it has maps and music but it is very pricey.  This watch has maps, but they come loaded with only a Korean gps location and so far I cant get it to load my location.  I was hoping to use this feature while biking and running but Im not sure this is possible.\n\nI swapped the band already because I really didnt like the one it came with.\n\nThis watch comes in a 4g lte version.  I considered this so I could run without my phone, but decided against it since you need to pay another fee to your cellular provider to use it without your phone to make and receive calls.  I havent tried loading music on the phone yet but have used the watch to forward and pause tracks while running with i heart radio.\n\nI also loaded the navigation app that goes with Google maps.  That works so when you set a use google maps on your phone your watch navigates your route\n\nUpdate:. 9/12/18\n\nOne of the main reasons i decided on this watch is because I could answer calls on it while working without pulling out my phone.  This worked great until the last update, now my watch only buzzes and doesnt tell me who is calling and gives no options for answering.  Also I tried to use the find my car app and it doesnt seem to work.  The touch screen is lagging sometimes.  Also while working out it doesnt seem to read my hear rate.  Also I tried to reset the watch and I cant even do that.  I am seriously considering returning it even though I loved it for the first 2 weeks.",

I get about 3 days of battery with every fitness feature except the heart rate monitor turned off.\nNow let's talk about the OS, IT'S AWFUL.  I don't know what Samsung was thinking, Tizen OS is the worst, glitchiest,  and most sluggish operating system i have ever seen. Especially the speak to text feature, 9/10 times it hears the wrong word, or if you speak too fast, it won't even type what you said.  I'm glad the new series 3, 4 and 5 are using google wear OS i hear instead of tizen. That's a step in the right direction, problem is, they made the batteries smaller in those watches instead of larger. So, you're sacrificing battery life to get a proper working operating system on the new watches. I paid 199 for this watch, which i don't think is worth it with how clunky the OS is. If you can get one for under 100 since this version is 4 gens old now, go for it,  the battery is a lot better on this version than the newer watches.",

                "review_body": "I've been wanting a smart watch for a while now and finally decided to pull the trigger.  My biggest criterion were that it had to be reasonably sized, reasonably priced, have GPS, and be able to have offline maps.  I really liked the look of the Gear S3 Frontier and the Galaxy watches (let's be real - the new 42mm Galaxy watch in black is basically the Frontier's little brother), and I LOVE the rotating bezel.\n\nI tried out both the S3 Frontier and the Galaxy watch and came to the following conclusions.\n1) Look - the style of both watches are very similar (which you can see from the product photos).\n2) Size - the 46mm Frontier watch is obviously larger than the 42mm Galaxy.  The watch band on the Frontier is thicker and has a slightly wider style that made it look larger than it actually is.  I ended up buying a smaller band similar to the style on the Galaxy to remedy this.  For me, the 42mm Galaxy wins on size.  The screen was only slightly smaller, but the watch as a whole was much smaller (as you can see from my comparison pictures).  The thickness of the two watches is about the same.\n3) Rotating Bezel - I found the bezel on the Frontier was easier for me to use.  It's slightly taller than the one on the Galaxy, and the notches on the side are bigger.  The Galaxy bezel fit into the face of the watch a bit more smoothly, so you have to rotate it from the top of the watch, whereas on the Frontier you can rotate it from the side or top.\n4) Navigation - navigation through the different widgets and apps was very intuitive on both watches.  You can use the bezel or touchscreen to move through items, and the two buttons on the side to select and navigate.\n5) Maps - ultimately this was the item that tipped the scale in favor of the Frontier for me.  There's an app you can download called HERE WeGo which provides directions from your location to your destination.  Very similar to how Google Maps works.  However, it also supports an offline functionality where you can download maps of an area (state / province / etc.) so you have them available without being connected to your phone.  The downside to this is that it doesn't have a satellite or topographic view, but I tested it out locally and the trails I took were all on there.  So if I go hiking somewhere and get lost, I have a general idea of where I am - I can see it on the map.  When I tested HERE WeGo on the new Galaxy watch it doesn't function unless you're connected to the phone, because you can't download offline maps to the Galaxy.  I checked with their support team and they said they will consider it for the future (but that doesn't help me now).\n\nUltimately I ended up keeping the S3 Frontier and returning the Galaxy.  The Galaxy won on size and waterproof rating, but I just couldn't justify spending almost double on the Galaxy when it wouldn't meet one of my biggest criterion (the offline maps).  It's no Suunto or Garmin or Casio, but for the price point it meets my needs as a GPS watch.",

                "review_body": "I'll very briefly state that I once owned a fitbit with a wristband that could not be removed and that it caused rashes on my wrist. I wore the Galaxy watch with the default band and it caused a similar effect. When it comes to negatives with the physical device, this is my only complaint. Luckily there are a myriad of choices for wristbands to aleviate this issue. Go wild!\n\nNow onto the stuff I liked.\n\nOn my second day with the watch, (being the clumsy idiot I am) I walked in the house with my arms loose as normal as I have not worn a watch for many years, and I slammed my wrist into a door. Obviously this was cause for concern when I saw the scuffs all over the rotating part of the watch. To my surprise, it was the door that had suffered and not the watch! The paint cleaned right off and there was zero damage to the watch. Big points for being tough right off the bat.\n\nThe rotating bezel is just plain fun to use to navigate to the different functions, even if you can just flick the screen to achieve the same result. Mine did show some slight lag here and there but it is not to the point where it just isn't working. After using it for a while you can just automatically turn it to what you want without even looking, like shifting gears in a car.\n\nAs for the app that pairs with the watch, the usual samsung crap is included like samsung pay, but you at least have the option to keep it off the watch for the most part. As for the rest of the stuff on there, you'll get access to calls, texts, and even e-mails if you're using that specific email service (didn't see gmail but don't quote me on that) which as a first time and admittedly late adopter to the smartwatch era I found incredible. The speaker on the watch is loud and makes calls simple and easy to hear. I didn't even know the watch had a speaker when I bought it so that was a fun surprise.\n\nThrough the wearable app you have the ability to reorganize all the apps on the watch as well as remove or add as you desire, and it's fairly simple to use so anyone willing to just read what's on the screen will be able to customize the layout to suit their needs best.\n\nFor many I assume that the health features are the reason for the purchase, as that was my main draw for it. There's dozens upon dozens of exercises the watch can help keep track of, including even some weight lifting. It has a step counter, - of course - a heartrate monitor, stress tracker(?), sleep tracker, and has pretty much everything that the phone version of samsung health features in a compact package. If you do not have the watch connected to your phone, when you reconnect it'll synchronize all the data together so even if you had one device away from you charging, the other will count your steps for example and then bring that data to one spot when you reconnect. The sleep tracker caught me off guard with how spot on it seems to be with your sleep times. I kept watch on that for about a week and I think it'd be a valuable tool for those trying to maintain a consistent sleep schedule.\n\nSome people I saw complained that the heart rate monitor was draining their battery quickly, but you can set it to check only when you initiate that so keep it in mind. I'll typically get a full 4 days with it charged to max, but this is just everyday use without much heartrate monitor use or health tracking. It's about 3 days and a half when I do use it to track exercise, so it's still a pretty awesome battery life considering how much smaller it is compared to the larger watch model. There are many options for you to mess around with in order to optimize battery life, so just don't let the \"heartrate monitor\" reviewers scare you off about how long it lasts.\n\nThere is much more that can be said about the device, but for those of us not too interested in having the latest model and just needing it for a little extra ease in life, I can fully recommend this watch. It certainly doesn't hurt that it's a nice looking piece, and with the seemingly endless options for wristbands and watch faces, no two watches ever have to look exactly the same.",

I was worried that the 46mm version would be too big on my wrist, and, based on how this one looks on my wrist, I was right. To give you an idea of how big my wrist is, this watch has two holes left on the band once worn at a comfortable tightness. (The watch also comes with another band that has more holes for a larger wrist). The rubber band that comes with the watch is minimalist and looks fine, but I wanted something a little more classy, so I ordered a brown leather band to spruce up the looks (it should be delivered next week). Also, you can see from my picture on the underside of the watch that it is super easy to switch bands using the little toggle switches. I like that this watch doesn't look like a smartwatch at first glance. It really does look like a regular analog watch.\n\nEASE OF USE:  I was able to jump right in and start using this watch with no issues. It took me about 45 minutes to set everything up, including downloading the apps for my phone, signing in to my accounts, and tweaking all of the settings to my liking. The rotating bezel makes it super easy to navigate around the menus, and the touchscreen is very responsive to swipes and taps. The screen looks great and is very clear and bright. I have my brightness set on 7, and it is perfect for being outside in the daylight or indoors. This 42mm version might be a tad too small of a screen for some, but it is just right for me. The battery took about an hour to fully charge, and it was on 25% when I received it, so I would guess 1 hour and 20 minutes to full charge from zero.\n\nDAY 1 BATTERY and USAGE IMPRESSIONS: I put the watch on at about 7 pm on day 1 and was messing with it most of the night, switching watch faces and exploring the options and tweaking settings. I then set it to Goodnight Mode (to turn off all notifications except alarm), and set it to track my sleep. The alarm vibrates and makes a sound. I'm not sure if the sound can be turned off...if so, I haven't figured out how. I'm a fairly heavy sleeper, and it was enough to wake me up. Also, the snooze option worked and was easy to do half-asleep. As I'm writing this, the watch has been on my wrist for about 19hrs, and it is at 72%. At this rate, I'll be able to get about 3 days of use, which is what the literature claims.\n\nTIZEN & APPS: I was worried that I wouldn't like the fact that the Tizen OS doesn't allow you to download 3rd party apps, and this IS a huge shortcoming for the watch. However, I have my phone on me all day, so there's really nothing I would want my watch to do that I wouldn't be fine with reaching into my pocket and pulling out my phone for. Anything else added to the watch (as far as apps) would be gimmicky and just extra. The main thing for me is that it DOES work with most third-party apps as far as notifications. My main concern was that I wouldn't be able to get text notifications because I use Textra for texting on my phone. But I was able to set the watch to get notifications from Textra, and when tested I was able to respond to the text using my watch. The Samsung app store is a joke, and 99% of the apps on there don't work at all. That was a huge disappointment.\n\nSPOTIFY NEGATIVE: I was excited to get to use Spotify on the watch with Bluetooth headphones. BUT, the Spotify streaming service only works on the watch if you have a Premium account, which I do not. So, there's that.\n\nPROS:\n-Looks great, classy (with a better band), and looks just like an analog watch.\n-Easy to use: The bezel, buttons, and menus all work together flawlessly.\n-Easy-to-replace bands. Plus, you can find a ton of bands online for fairly cheap.\n-Answering calls (and talking) is easy and clear and eliminates the need to pull your phone out (given that you're in an area where you can just talk aloud on speaker.)\n-Samsung Health works great at tracking steps, calories, etc, and the app also offers a lot of options for exercise programs and workout ideas, which is great for someone like me who is moderately active and needs a little push and assistance to get moving.\n\nCONS:\n-Tizen has limits as far as 3rd party app support, and the Samsung store is laughable, but you can still get notifications from most 3rd party apps.\n-While there are lots of options for watch faces, there's only a small amount of free ones that are decent. Most of them will cost you $2-$4.\n-Pricepoint is a little high. I was able to use my Health Savings Account card to purchase this watch due to having Type 1 Diabetes and getting my doctor to sign a paper saying the fitness aspect would help regulate my blood sugar, but if I wasn't able to do that I probably wouldn't have bought this watch because of the price.",

                "review_body": "I brought the smaller 42mm Galaxy watch in midnight black. My wrist is small and kind of narrow, the 42mm Galaxy watch fits perfectly.  I brought a black steel band for the watch but the band that came with the watch is so soft and light that I decided to use the watch with the standard black silicone band. The Galaxy watch is very light, I don't feel that I am wearing it. This watch can be use by itself or link by bluetooth to a android or an iOS smartphone.  I don't have a smartphone and the Galaxy watch app cannot be installed on a tablet, only a smartphone.  I try to install the Galaxy watch app on my Samsung Galaxy Tab S4 tablet, it would not install, a message said that the tablet is not an appropriate device. I install the software on the Galaxy watch standalone and connect it to my home network.  The Galaxy watch is working perfectly as a standalone smartwatch.  I will purchase a smartphone in the future but this smartwatch can be use without a smartphone but not using all of it's features. The 42mm Galaxy watch has approximately 2 - 3 days of charge before charging it again. The larger 46mm Galaxy watch has approximately 4 - 5 days of charge before having to place the watch on the charger. It will take approximately 2 hours to completely charge the Galaxy watch from 0 to 100%. I charge the Galaxy watch every morning while I am washing myself and getting dress. This is a feature rich and a very powerful smartwatch.  I had use a Garmin VIVOactive HR and a Fitbit Ionic smartwatch before purchasing the Samsung Galaxy watch. I notice that the price of the Galaxy watch is going down. Before buying a smartwatch,  cut out a 46mm circle out of cardboard and a 42mm circle,  place both on your wrist to see which size fits your wrist better.  The Samsung Galaxy Watch is one of the better smartwatch being sold. Goggle which smartwatch is the best or the better smartwatch being sold today. Samsung Galaxy Watch will be high on the list. I personal highly recommend the Samsung Galaxy Watch either the larger 46mm or the smaller 42mm size.",

                "review_body": "This is my first smartwatch, and I bought it more to test it out.  I really wasn't sure I was going to keep it, but after using it for about a month, I can say this will stay on my wrist daily.  The watch looks great.  I am glad I got the 42mm as the black on black is really sleek.  It makes my fiends iWatch look like a toy.  The screen is very clear and easy to see even outside.  I leave it set to brightness level of \"6\" and it adjusts for me when needed.  The watch faces are very cool, and there are literally thousands you can get, and many are free.  You can make this look like a fancy watch, a Casio, a gadget, tactical, and everything in between.  Really a fantastic looking watch.\n\nFor battery life, I average 3 days.  My first two charges didn't last as long, and I was a little worried.  But now I get three days with room to spare.  I do not sleep with it.  I put in airplane mode at night.  It is on my wrist and in use for 12-18 hours a day.  I have Wifi off, and location off because my Note 9 handles all that through Bluetooth.  I only have it monitor my heartrate when I am doing an exercise.  I take calls on it regularly, check email and texts, and use it for fitness.  I would say I am a moderate user.\n\nI love the built in altimeter and barometer, and found them to be reasonably accurate.  I also found the step tracking to be fairly accurate as well, though it does miss some steps here and there.  Sometimes it is simply delayed.  Tizen OS is smooth and easy to use, but there are not a lot of apps yet in the Samsung universe.  There are way behind Google and Apple in this respect.  I hope they keep updating their apps to better more useful ones, because right now, they are not that great.\n\nOverall I love this watch.  I am very happy I decided to try this out.  It really does make me think how I lived without one for so long.",

The system with the phone is very nice I can use it to track fitness, my music, phone calls. Plus it even has a speaker in it so you can answer calls and listen to music through the watch speaker if you need. The apps you can get are an amazing never ending feature. It runs off of the galaxy store but your not limited at all. So many useful apps to choose from and a list that keeps expanding makes it never get old. I highly reccomend this watch, just aware that Bezel is not super FL against the watch so if you spill something on it you might get something inside of it that can make it feel sticky or just stop moving. But it's okay it's waterproof so washing it in the sink whilst moving the bezel cleans it right up like it's brand new.\n\nMy only gripe is it's battery at first I could get almost 2 days out of the watch now I have to charge it every night. But other than that it works very well and highly reccomned it.",

                "review_body": "I love my Samsung Galaxy Watch! When I was looking for smart watches, I was tempted to buy the Samsung Galaxy Watch Active which was just launched back then. However, that one didn't had all the features that makes this one a great smartwatch. I love being able to pick up a call and talk through the watch, people hear me perfectly and I hear them very well. In addition, when I'm home I connect to WiFi rather than bluetooth, it gives me a greater range and watch does not disconnect when I leave the phone in another room.\n\nPros:\n-Amazing battery time, can last over a week depending on use. (For example, only connecting BT when not home).\n-Tracks my stress levels several times a day, it is accurate. Has a relaxation feature with breathing exercises. LOVE IT.\n-Tracks my BPM, accurate but you need to stay still.\n-Samsung Health is a good app. I track my bike rides and it syncs with the phone app without any issues. I have yet to use Strava.\n-Alarms! But also, alarms set on the phone only will also go off on the watch. So no need to have alarms set on watch and phone. BT or WiFi needs to be connected for this.\n-SmartThings: can control my Samsung Smart TV from my watch (WiFi connected)\n-Can control Spotify\n-Find my phone and find my watch functions.\n\nBasic functions:\n-Step counter, not incredible accurate but then again I haven't tried any other device for this.\n-Calories burned during exercise.\n-Actual watch, wide range of faces to choose from. Analog, digital, combined, there is a watch face for every taste.\n\nThings I have not tried:\n-Sleep tracking. I mean, the watch is comfortable and all, but I cannot sleep with any accessory on.\n\nSome cons, not a big deal for me:\n-GPS seems to be a little unrealiable.\n-Sometimes when measuring BPM or stress (which is measure based on BPM) the watch would give an error and ask you to clean the sensor.\n-That same sensor, will go off when you are not wearing the watch, presumably for the automatic BPM and stress measures, but it should have a way to tell you are not wearing it and not try again and again.\n\nBut the cons are not a deal breaker for me. Maybe I'm doing something wrong or not using it as I should. Anyway, completely recommend this smartwatch even after there is a newer version out there. I don't think the newer ones have this amazing battery life and versatility this one has.\n\nThat is all, hope this helps. Oh, remember to pair with a Samsung phone to enjoy ALL the features. ??",

                "review_body": "A couple of quick notes before I get into the review:\n\n-I'm reviewing the 42mm version, which I've had for about 3 weeks now.\n-Apple vs. Samsung comparisons are overblown; both are good watches, but obviously you should match your watch to your phone\n-I don't think there's a better smartwatch available at the moment, but I'm only giving this watch 4 stars because I don't think smartwatch technology has fully matured at this stage; I'd say there are no 5 star smartwatches at the moment\n\nBottom line: The Galaxy Watch does almost everything I was hoping for, and does it pretty well\n-My settings: AoD on with a simple face, brightness 3, location off, HR every 10 min, voice activation off; I use the watch whenever I'm away from home \u2013 appx 11hrs/day\n-With those settings and that usage pattern, I get through 2 days on a charge with a bit to spare\n-Reading and responding to notifications is smooth\n-Overall, I'd say the exercise tracking is pretty good, not great\n-Step counting seems accurate for walking at a reasonable pace, but inaccurate for slow walking or a mix of walking/standing (such as when moving through a museum)\n-I mainly use S Health for HR tracking, which works well for steady state cardio but less well for weight training. I'm not sure if it\u2019s thrown off by rapid fluctuations in my HR, moving around a bit on wrist during exercise, or what, but it often loses track of my HR, lags behind spikes and dips, and doesn\u2019t seem to reach true peaks\n-For weight lifting, S health isn\u2019t that useful; it can\u2019t count reps on that many exercises and doesn't allow for custom workout design\n-I use an app (gymrun) that allows custom workout design; it doesn\u2019t track HR or count reps, but you can manually enter reps and use S health (on \u2018other workout\u2019) to track HR\n-I was hoping that the Galaxy Watch would allow me to leave my phone in my locker at the gym, and that I'd be able to use the watch to (1) play music, (2) track my workout, and (3) connect to wifi so I can send/receive texts/emails\n-The good news is that the watch is capable of doing all of that with no lag \u2013 even when running music + wifi + S health continuous HR monitoring + gymrun\n-The bad news is that the watch can\u2019t connect to captive portal wifi (networks that require you to visit a website and accept terms), and that  the watch burns through appx 30% battery in an hour if you do all of that\n-The floors-climbed counter is mixed; it's sometimes quite accurate but sometimes misses floors\n\nStyle, comfort, and build\n-I'm a male of above average height, and the 42mm watch face is right size for me; there are online watch face size calculators based on wrist size \u2013 you\u2019d have to have quite large wrists for a larger watch to look \u2018appropriate\u2019\n-Of course style is subjective and some prefer a larger face, but for me, 42mm is as large as I was willing to go, and the availability of a 42mm version was a huge selling point\n-The watch looks good overall; it's not the world\u2019s best looking watch but certainly something that\u2019s well worth wearing anywhere from the gym to the office to a night out\n-The watch is thicker than I anticipated; from the side, it looks quite chunky\n-It's very comfortable; I don't notice it during the day, even when typing; it doesn\u2019t get in the way while lifting weights\n-Build quality seems good so far \u2013 no dents or scratches, but it hasn\u2019t seen hard knocks\n\nHardware\n-This is where the Galaxy Watch really shines, in 2 areas in particular: the SoC (chip that powers the watch) and the rotating bezel\n-I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever use a watch without a rotating bezel; it's the best way to interact with a smartwatch by far \u2013 it allows you to navigate without blocking/smudging the screen or maneuvering both hands to spin a tiny wheel on a side button\n-The SoC blows away everyone but apple; wear os watches are 2+ generations behind\n-As a result, battery life is excellent (by current smartwatch standards) and apps run smoothly\n\nSoftware\n-This is most people\u2019s biggest complaint \u2013 not so much the OS but the limited app availability\n-Tizen OS is actually quite intuitive, fluid, and customizable\n-Lack of apps does not bother me \u2013 aside from the use cases I described up top, I\u2019d rather use my phone for any other apps anyway\n-But google integration is not perfect and many apps are not available; if this is something you care about, do some research about what is/is not available on the watch",

                "review_body": "I am always leary buying something used but, I took a leap of faith and ordered a 42mm watch. It was in used/like new condition. It arrived a few days after ording and as advertised it came in a white aftermarket box and contained an OEM charging block, cable and charger. Overall the watch was in good condition. There were some light surface marks on it but, I was looking for blemishes. The watch face did not have any scratches. The band which was an OEM black plastic band was a little dirty but, cleaned up by using a clorox wipe on it. It was dead so it tood a little for it to charge up. Installed the app and got everying up and running with little effort. Using it my first day I found that I still needed to tweek some of the settings. I had plenty of battery left at the end of the day. I charged it overnight and decided I wanted to see how much battery life I would have. I ended up with one full day/night and the battery took me through to a 2nd day and at 930 pm I was down to about 3% battery. I have no issue charging daily but, wanted to see if I ended up working late how much time would I have before it goes dead. My opinion is that I was satisfied with just about 2 days of use. There are an abundance of watch faces to meet everyone's needs and taste. I really wanted a more smart watch to monitor my O2 sats, heart rate, etc and this does a great job in doing that. I also set reminders if I am sedentary too long, it will prompt me to get moving. So, to those who are squeamish on buying used items take the plunge and buy it. Use the money you would have spent on a new watch on a band, screen protector, etc. I realize there are more current watches that do more but, the features on this watch checked off all of my boxes. As for the features, I find the heart rate and O2 measuring are very accurate as well as the step tracking. Very happy with this purchase!",

                "review_body": "I had a Frontier S3 that unfortunately died after 2.5 years. I loved that watch but I decided if I was going to buy a new smart watch I wanted to research all options. I didn't want an apple watch because I had their first generation watch (which was fine), I use a Samsung phone, and it seems like everyone has an apple watch. When I had my frontier I always got complements because it looks different and like a real watch. I looked at fitbit, garmin, and others and decided that I really did like the features and look of the Samsung watch best. Of course then I had to decide between the new Active and 2 different sizes of the Galaxy. I chose the Galaxy because it had the bezel and also the integrated speaker which is nice. If I didn't care about those 2 things I probably would have selected the Active. Then I debated about the size and whether to stick with the slightly large 46mm form factor the frontier had or the smaller 42mm. I went to a Verizon store to see the difference in person and landed on the smaller 42mm size. I'm really happy with it. The watch looks great, has fantastic battery life, and works really well. The SHealth app leaves a little to be desired but I think I'll look around at 3rd party alternatives. One tip - the batteries in these devices have about a 2 year lifespan. Do yourself a favor and get an extended warranty. I searched Amazon and found the ASURION 3 year personal care extended protection plan. It isn't that expensive and basically means you're covered for 4 years in total. Trust me, it's worth it. There are several variations of the protection plans so make sure to get the personal care one I've mentioned. Good luck!",

The vibrations are not real strong, but I found if I wear it looser on my wrist like a bracelet, I feel it better as it rests near my hand.

It's stylish and I can still track my steps when away from my phone. Keep in mind it doesn't monitor heart rate if that is something you are in the market for. It also has the potential to monitor sleep, but I can just see myself shattering the watch face while tossing and turning, so I don't take advantage of that one.\n\nThe band on this model is a very light leather so this model will get dirtier quicker than the others. My only warning is that as this is a normal watch battery, having all the fancy text notifications and whatnot will run the battery down quicker. This is a potential inconvenience, but the app does a good job at telling where the battery of the watch is. I got very nervous after going through 5% of the battery within a couple of days, but I turned off text notifications and I have been at 95% for almost a month since.",

It has an elegant, classical appeal - which some may find old fashioned - but it sits very nicely on my wrist.  The black band, silver case, white face and uncluttered display are very pleasing to the eye.  I found the BM clasp a bit fiddly at first, but now I have adapted and enjoy the flat buckle fit.  Although I didn't realise it at the time of purchase, it has a 24 hour subdial, with a secondary time zone hand - an unexpected bonus.  Very happy indeed.",

I did so because they added one year to the warranty and do all of the repairs and maintenance (if needed) on site.  In addition, they did give me a nice reduction in price, which I have found is not unusual for upscale watches.  Okay, it isn't as good a price as I could get on line, but this is not a gray market watch and comes with a full U.S. warranty.  Often, the discounted watches are gray market and do not come with an American warranty.  I looked at other watches, including one by Tag Heuer and also Mont Blanc.  But when I saw them in person, I found that they looked like very expensive sports watches.  To be sure, they were very fine looking.  But for me I find that the Baume & Mercier looks more elegant.  This is a watch that I will not wear daily (I am very active in the high Rockies ... wearing a Baume & Mercier while backcountry skiing at 12,000 ft altitude is sort of over the top).  I have recently purchased a watch winder so that the watch will not loose time while it sits in its case.  This has been a great purchase, looks wonderful, and is a great anniversary gift for me!",

I wore a Submariner no date for years, and it was a great watch, but I didn't like the newly updated version with the ceramic dial (a nice upgrade) and the bulging body (blingy and unbecoming for a Rolex). This watch combines the best attributes of both Submariners (a classic design with a nearly indestructible ceramic bezel), with Omega's terrific co-axial caliber 8400 movement, which keeps time as well or better than any watch I've owned. The photos do not capture how well the polished links and bezel elements pick up the light and contrast with the matte black bezel with vintage style lume (though do be prepared to wipe it regularly, the mirror like finish does pick up finger prints quickly).  And if you don't want to deal with fingerprints, it also looks great and understated on a NATO, as seen in James Bond Spectre.  It's just an overall stunning watch in person that immediately displaced the rest of my collection as my daily wearer, and yes, it will go SCUBA diving with me soon enough.\n\nI can say I would take this without hesitation over the new SubC and it has (at least for now) relegated my older Sub to the closet. The Jaeger Tribute to Deepsea and Blancpain Fifty Fathoms are very similar looking; they obviously have a rarity factor that the Omega doesn't, but I'm not sure they're better watches, espeiclaly when you look at things like the 8400s unique co-axial technology and 15,000 gauss anti-magnetic protection. Throw in a not insignificant price difference and it was an easy call for me.\n\nHighly recommended.",

The watch is of a timeless design and is of very high quality and build. The Swiss ETA movement is the finest such Quartz movement available today and the case is equal in quality to most all of the finest Swiss manufacturers. The face of the watch is a perfect size and the Genuine Crocodile Leather Strap is elegant and a keeper. Considering the watch is being sold today at 55% off list price; this represents one of the best values out there. A similiar Baume Mercier or Oris Watch would run about $1,300 to $3,500. The overall look and quality is better than similiar Tissot Classics especially the movement itself. This Raymond Weil has an inspired look of a Patek Phillippe yet retains the elegant casual look of a Baume Mercier Watch. Amazing looks, great value and a great addition to any collection!!!",

I do like the care that it was given in the packaging a plus. However there were small knicks in the glass by the 6 and 7. I hesitated by sending it back due to the timing that I received it and decided not to. I will give him the option later. The quality of the watch is unmatched. It also came with a note from the seller \"I hope you enjoy\"!! The band is genuine leather and very durable. Overall I like it a lot and I hope he will be pleased a well. It is a MUST for that math genius!",

However I started running into problems about two months in when it stopped ticking while still on my wrist, suggesting that the self winding movement was going through some problems. However this eventually went away and I thought it some sort of clockwork hiccup. About 4 days before the return deadline it completely stopped functioning; no amount of winding, or moral encouragements could get it to tick again. I didn't spend close to a grand for a lackadaisical watch, although I suppose that could add some character. Whether this is Amazon's handling/QA fault or Raymond Weil's is the question. Either way, my refund was not processed because while I dropped it off at UPS 2 days prior to the cut off, it didn't arrive until a couple of days later so buyers beware.",

                "review_body": "I am rather opinionated when it comes to luxury watches.  This comes from spending 2 years in watchmaking school, studying directly under the guidance of a certified master swiss watchmaker who came here from Europe.  Watches, especially mid to high grade swiss watches, are a passion of mine.  I am not loyal to a brand or a style or anything else.  I judge them for what they are, in terms of quality, function, construction, and style.  A watchmakers point of view.\n\nThis said I will tell you that this particular watch is what I consider to be a \"best kept secret\" sort of watch.  This is an AUTOMATIC watch (read: Mechanical - NOT Quartz), and of CHRONOMETER grade function.  Chronometer as used here is a measure of accurate timekeeping, not quality - a point often misunderstood - and is used mostly from a marketing point of view by companies such as Rolex.  HOWEVER.  This movement in THIS watch is actually EXCELLENT in terms of quality, time keeping ability, and construction - easily comparable to other Swiss made movements from other famous manufacturers costing several times as much.  This watch, properly serviced, will provide a lifetime of use - and probably more.  Absolutely the sort of watch you pass down to the next generation.\n\nAll in all - and EXCELLENT choice - especially for those seeking their first QUALITY Swiss watch purchase.\n\nDefinitely recommended!",

It can be set to military time and it chimes every hour on the hour. Some of the functions are hard to maneuvre around but if you play with it for a little while you will get the hang of it. The instructions that come with try their best to lead you through all the functions but some of it is trial and error, I think.",

My wrist starts to feel a little bit uncomfortable at first because of extra weight of this watch.  It is a unique dress watch that you don't see it everyday.  Would recommend this watch along with Oris.  If Rado ever redesign the bezel with more like a real normal watch instead of big, and heavy bezel like this one, I would probably add more rado to my collection.\nEven though I like this watch, but for me, Oris is still far better in quality and price.",

                "review_body": "First, don't listen to reviews that have nothing to do with the watch which serve no purpose and don't belong in a review section, but a seller section. Reviews should be about the watch, seller reviews should be about the seller. Buying from a unauthorized dealer in Israel and have omega pay for it has nothing to do with the watch itself. Nor does a delivery not happening have anything to do with the watch.\n\nNow for a real review.\n\nThe attention to detail in this watch is on par with anything from a Automatic version of this watch. Only difference is the movement. Other than that they are the same. Being a person who owns a couple Rolex autos, omega autos, the fit and finish of this Aqua Terra and rivals\nAny of them. What you are getting here is a watch with the build quality Omega is known for.\n\nThe new Quartz versions of this watch are not made as well as this one here. They have painted on indices, not applied, painted logo not applied. Here is a fast fact. They are not making anymore of this version of the Aqua Terra with the same build quality as the autos. The new ones compared to the Autos are made to look cheaper. These are not.\n\nOmega is one of the top brand of watches in the world, period. Easily on par with Rolex, and in some cases surpasses them. Google a Rolex Sub vs a Sea-master and look at the comparisons. This watch is going to go up in value, since they don't make them anymore.\n\nThe watch face is 39.2 mm, compared to the newer models of 38.5mm. The movement in this is the Omega is the 1538 a rhodium plated 6 jewel movement. It has a independent hour hand setting for traveling which is convenient. I own a quartz Bond Sea-master and a 2016 Planet ocean auto. My seamaster with a 1538 quartz movement is accurate to 00.8 seconds a month! This is straight from Omega after a overhaul. My planet ocean isn't close to that and it has a Co-Axial 8500 movement which is considered by many as one of the most accurate on the planet, even surpasses the 3135 from a Rolex sub! Not that I am expecting a Auto to be as accurate as a quartz, since buying a Auto with the accuracy of a quartz isn't why a you buy a Auto. You buy a Auto for the craftsmanship and art of the movement. A quartz is bought for accuracy and convenience.\n\nThe band of the watch is superb, its sliding mechanism makes putting on and taking off the watch a breeze, the case is finely polished and the dial has the attention to detail which is expected of a Omega watch. The band is very comfortable and does not pinch the arm or gets uncomfortable after extended wear. My only gripe is that the clasp sliding mechanism could be a little shorter and it tends to make the weight of the watch a little uneven depending on where you have links removed. But hardly noticeable. Not a deal breaker by any means.\n\nOmega's customer service is second to none. When you go to a Omega Boutique they have a sitting area with Cappuccino, Espresso, and your snack of choice, cookie, shortbread etc. You get pampered and are shown respect. Any thing I asked them to do they did happily! Never in the 15 years of owning a Omega have I had a bad experience with them. Now am i saying they don't mess up. No. They do. Everyone does, but they make it right in the long run. It's how they tackle and fix problems, not the problems themselves. That is a true mark excellence in my opinion. I get treated better by Omega than by Rolex.\n\nNow is this a replacement for a Auto, no. It's not meant to be. But if you want a well made watch this is more accurate than any auto, has the build quality of Omega is known for and a customer experience to back it up. This Aqua Terra is a good choice.",

Watch was exchanged and after 3 weeks of usage same issue re-occured already on new  watch.\n I took this upto Omega and Local  official dealer and explained, that I expected something more durable and honest starting from buying and  throughout  usage of \"luxury\" product\nSolution from Omega? Take same watch 3rd time! For me twice was enough and I asked for some better solution and compensation for  my disappointment and dealer agreed to give me watch of ... TISSOT as a compensation. I was shocked and amused.\nAttempt to explain difference between Omega and Tissot buyers profile were fruitless. Official dealer did nto agree to upgrade my watch to another Omega one for unhonesty of their shop during purchase and product  bad quality.\nAt the end, after  3 months,  my purchase was refunded, watch returned  and I was granted to pick up complimentary SWATCH  watch for all the inconvenience  :-)\nOffical Omega? No response at all.\nSo for me and my family members Omega is the sign of bad quality, ugly customer support and not understanding their customer profile. My advice to collegues and friends - never buy Omega, especially in Israeli \"Impress\" shops and \"Roltime Ltd\" dealer.",

                "review_body": "I've been looking at Breitling for years but have been hesitant due to the weight that these watches can pack. I prefer larger watches because I have large hands, but I'm not crazy about having a heavy item strapped to my wrist. --->Finally, Breitling has designed a watch perfect to my needs. It's a 45mm watch that wears more like a 44mm. It is titanium, which is substantially lighter than stainless steel, and has a 22mm canvas strap that tapers down to 20mm. It has a rubber inlay which keeps the watch from sliding up and down the wrist, holding it in one position throughout the day. I love it. I'll come back in 6 months to provide an update on the build quality of the strap, and give an honest opinion on my first, post honeymoon, Breitling experience.",

What came was a red faced watch with a small U on the face with the feather heading off to the side. They did correspond with me at the end of December (when it should have been already sent/received) letting me know that the watch I ordered was out of stock and gave me the option to upgrade or wait. I told them I would wait because I wanted the smaller faced watch than what was offered with the in-stock upgrade. The watch received today is a larger faced watch (bigger than 28mm). I love the simplicity of the watch shown. It looks nothing like this picture. But because my son already has waited far too long for this purchase, we will keep. However, we will more than likely never do business with these people again. =(",

I had a dressy type of UM logo watch but it was not appropriate for every occasion.\n\nMy biggest fear prior to ordering this watch was that the face and strap will be too small for a man.  I ordered another brand in the past and ended up giving it to my girlfriend because it was made more for either a woman's or child's wrist.\n\nThis one arrive in great shape and well packaged in a plastic case.  The face of the watch is still not as large as I prefer, but it is acceptable (I enjoy wearing large face sports watches).  The strap is a bit short for a male's wrist, but I ended up pulling the Velcro strap through the first opening of the fastener and it works just fine.  So far so good on quality and durability, and I've worn it to a couple of football games.\n\nThe biggest take-away is to give this watch second thoughts if you have a large wrist (unless you do not mind purchasing a new strap for it).  Otherwise it is a good buy at $27.  I will provide an update towards the end of the football season.\n\nGo Tigers!!",

It's a perfect size watch for medium wrist sizes. It's comfortable to wear and the crown does not get in the way of wrist motion. The crown has the GS logo. The GMT bezel is indeed bi-colored which does not appear in the stock photo but when you view it from PoV of your eyes it will refract the light such that you can tell the daylight half. It has an opencase back. It's a limited edition.",

The leather band is a shiny, patent leather and it's nicely padded on the inside. Everything was attached properly and is working fine. The face is sturdy and seems to be of good quality. There are hundreds of Stuhrling designs out there and reviews are overwhelming positive, especially on the skeleton watches. This is my son's second Stuhrling and his first (two years old now) is still in great condition. Note that he is a 17 year old and generally hard on his things. I'll update my review if after he receives the gift, we find any problems.",

The description boasts of fine Swiss design, Swiss quality, and produced with strict oversight by Swiss engineers, but the one tiny sticker I found which was the ONLY place anywhere that said where it was actually made...\"Made in China\". The leather band was horribly fake plastic looking, the metal feels cheap, and....this is the capper....the minute hand wasn't even attached!

Does not require a battery to run just need to ensure you wind it twice a day or so, I find i do it quite often now out of habit. A few complaints I have so far is the minute hand seems to fall behind every few days where I find myself resetting the time after it starts to fall behind a few minutes, I'm not sure if it's not counting seconds properly or what, I don't claim to be a watch expert.  While the band had a leather smell to it and still seems to be holding up so far, however the 2 straps that you tuck the excess band into do not seem to be made out of leather as I can already see a bit of wear on them and they definitely are not as shiny as the rest of the leather band. I don't wear it in the shower even though it's supposed to be water resistant just out of caution and the inner side of the band is more porous and has a slight odor with sweat after the 3 weeks of wear.  Unlike most other watches I have worm in my life this does not snag on my wrist hair like most metal watches do. The face and metal still show no visible scratches on the glass which makes me hope it's good quality.  Most watches I've ever owned usually have scratched faces after only owning for a week or so. I'll update in a few weeks.",

Blue, red and green. I was fortunate enough to see all 3 models in a Houston store. I also own the red. The green model is super kewl, but it is GREEN, GREEN, GREEN.\n\nI recommend this watch to everyone who wants a watch that is unique and different. However, I can only rate this watch at 4 stars because of the strap. It looks beautiful, but is stiff as plywood. I wore for a month, but still had to fight taking it on/off. Not kewl for this price.\n\nI ended up buying an alligator strap with deployment clasp off Ebay for $15 as a replacement. Now I wear both watches all the time.\n\nOne last comment. The Apocalypse series is the Epiphany Collection not Special Reserve. Check out the other Apocalypse models at sturhling.com. They are all awesome!",

Not using the recommended tools is a bit of a risk, but I was able to take a slat off of each side with not much frustration and thankfully no scratches.  The Ceramic Slats are way cool.  They aren't as smooth and glossy as the pictures show (thank God).  More like a black stainless steel.  They look kick-ass.  The bezel is fairly flat, but not nearly as flat as my old Movado Museum.  On some of the higher-ended Rados, they have the ultra flat, low profile bezel/crystal (that's the 'wow' factor I was talking about above that is missing somewhat with this watch).  The black on black with red highlights are what appealed most to me about this watch.  I grew up in the 80s when Swatches were the thing.  This to me, has that same kind of look but with more modern high tech components (Ceramic, Quartz and Sapphire Crystal).  I am interested to see how well it keeps time over a period of a few months.  That will be a big factor.  But for now, I'm happy after nearly a week.",

I own three black bays - one with the older ETA movement, and two with the new movement. If there is one thing I am not crazy about it\u2019s the riveted bracelet but apparently I am in the minority on this. The older versions have the bracelet with no rivets which I think is cleaner. Howeve of the three I won this one gets the most wear.\n\nThis is the best value for the price for any luxury timepiece out there. By a mile.",

                "review_body": "I mean, it's alright. I was thinking my wife would like it but I had to sell her to buy it, which you might think makes it pointless. But I had reached that point where you're just committed; you've made the decision in your mind and you're like, 'alright, I'm doing this' and you can't back down because if you go back on what you've decided in your mind, what kind of man are you? I mean, if you can't even stick to your own ideals, what can you stick to? So I had reached that point and realized that I didn't have the money. Well now it became a problem solving venture. I had to figure this out. I could sell the house, but then how could I keep my investment safe? I could sell my truck, but I gotta get to work to pay for the insurance on it. I could have sold my kids, but you know, future of the nation and all. So I finally settled on selling my wife. They are renewable resources as far as being able to find another and continue to do god's work. Luckily, I was able, through thrifty money wrangling, to make a decent profit, even after purchasing the watch. Now, the watch itself is a fine piece. The hands on the face a clear and easy to see. It keeps time well, although you do have to set in manually. The back is pretty neat; being able to see the workings and all. The band could use some improvement. The material is rather warm and the color isn't my cup of tea. If only my wife could have seen it. Oh well. I'm thinking of purchasing a second one to keep in a lock box. Oh, if anyone is interested, I have for sale a sturdy, hardworking personal assistant. He is about 13 and is capable of traveling at 8 mph and has a range of 80 miles on a single fill up. He is capable of lifting almost 130 lbs, but that can pushed to 160 lbs with the use of included cattle prod. If interested, feel free to contact my sales agent.",

But the face has an underwhelming, drug-store watch looking design on the dial. And to make matters worse, the crystal on the face has an unusually elevated, dome-like shape to it, which looks awkward and also distorts your view of the face when looking from certain angles. Not a terrible watch, but the bracelet doesn't justify buying a watch with a face like this. I guess you could say this watch is a butterface. Heyo.",

The watch is beautiful, when you can see it. The numbers disappear when not in bright light. It is not comfortable to wear and is the heaviest watch I own. For reference my Tag Heuer  F-1 auto chrono is the most comfortable bracelet watch I own. The Breitling bezel seems thick and the dial seems small, given it's a 45mm width. The reason I have this is because I went for the Super Avenger chrono, but at 48mm it was WAAAAAY too big for my smaller wrist. There is no denying the quality you will get with an authentic Breitling. I do love this watch and have worn it a few times already. I have quite a few watches so it's more of a round-robin situation for me. The volcano black dial is very black, but not shiny. There is just enough red to add interest, but avoid fashion fatigue. The stencil like numerals give it a tougher look. The watch sits high above the wrist and is very thick.",

Now, on to the negative.  I researched this watch for hours on the internet before buying and seen very few negatives about the watch.  One of my main concerns was the quality of the crystal.  This watch (supposedly) has a Krysterna crystal which is one of the strongest crystals a watch can have.  They're supposed to be basically indestructible.  I've worn this watch almost everyday since owning and wear it to work and in casual settings.  This watch did NOT get abused in any way.  I noticed one day though that there was a scratch on the crystal.  I was furious, as I'm sure most would be.  So, I took it off and the next day I looked at the watch again and it had cracked the ENTIRE way through from side to side.  My watch now needs a replacement crystal, which I'm sure isn't cheap.  The crystal is NOT covered through the warranty.  Stuhrling claims to sell \"quality\" pieces but I beg to differ.  So, stay away from this watch, or at least buying through amazon (I now question if the watch was authentic).",

I certainly wouldn't pay more than that for this watch.\n\nAnd frankly, you'll get a far better watch spending $30-$40 on a Timex, which while basic and meant to be, is built to a generally higher quality level. Do not pay MSRP on these for any reason ($300 range is laughable) and do not even pay the Amazon price without handling one first, as you're likely to imagine that you're getting more for it than you actually are.",

Looks great with casual or formal wear. The metallic bracelet looks great & shiny with its invisible deployment lock. The movement has been so perfect with timekeeping (i am not sure about seconds gained/lost).\nI've been getting lot of compliments when i started using it. And so i've given 5star rating",

It's not a big deal tho, got fixed easily.\n\nUpdate Aug-16: I've been wearing this watch exactly for a year and this is a good product. I don't understand what people are expecting from this dark-themed watch. It is all black, from the case to the minute and second hands. The picture tells, everybody. Look at the picture. If you don't want a watch that you can't see under decent light source, so do not buy it. It is not for you. But because of this design, this watch looks very cool and minimalist. Very. I still get compliments to the watch. It is a two-in-one, decent watch and wrist band. I would give this 4 stars because the case is brushed metal and I wear it upside down of my arm, so the corners and metal around the face got a little worn-off as I rub my arm to table and different surfaces. I wish it was painted well enough to hold its color a little longer. Other than that, I am very satisfied with this purchase and thinking about getting the winston royale silver one.",

The green is beautiful and so is the gold (although at times it looks like a fake gold to me, but I don't care so much). The only gripe I have is the latch to undo the watch. After constantly readjusting the watch to fit my wrist, putting the watch on, then removing the watch, my fingers stated to hurt since it's kinda tough to undo. That's probably a good thing though, as you know it won't unlatched itself easily. But man...my fingers hurt. I love the size now, but I might have loved it even more if the face was a bit smaller.",

                "review_body": "My 9 year old Tag Heuer Teal Professional Quartz watch is still a beautiful timepiece and I will continue to wear it in rotation, but I wanted to move up a notch. I shopped for weeks looking for something in my price range with all the correct features.\n\nThis watch caught my eye because of the color and I appreciated the concept of the hybrid electromechanical drive. As an engineer, time accuracy is important. I didn't want a strictly automatic engine because of the annoying minor time drift most suffer from. Adjusting the watch becomes more of a hobby than it needs to be and I am sure I would obsess about it.\n\nThis watch is substantial. It has the nice, heavy feel I enjoy having on my wrist. The band is wonderful. I looked at a few Breitling watches, but the bands turned me off because of the way they tear arm hair out. The Tag Heuer band does not. It's bright and shiny and reflects light in a most enjoyable way.\n\nI will likely use the chronograph features of this watch only a few times a year. Unlike a lot of chronographs, the timer functions on this watch are unobtrusive. (It uses the clock hands for timing at the press of a button!)\n\nIt's a little tricky to set this watch up. It has \"modes\" of operation unlocked based on the position of the sweep hand and the crown stop. The calendar is perpetual. That's a welcome feature. You set it and forget it. No more being bothered by having to manually adjust the date at the end of months of less than 31 days. It's Leap Year aware as well.\n\nIf you are looking for a quality luxury watch at an affordable price point, you can't go wrong with a Tag Heuer like this one.",

                "review_body": "A short review of this watch:\n\nWeight:  It was not as heavy as I expected (even though it is quartz and I knew it would be lighter than an automatic), but it has a substantial quality to it. If you are new to the luxury watch market and are worried about getting used to the weight, this might be a good selection. For those that love a big heavy watch, this is probably too light for your taste, but like I said, still substantial.  I like a heavy watch, and while this is far from the heaviest that I own, I'm still pleased with it from this aspect.\n\nSize: With dimensions of 43mm and 13 mm, I again was surprised by the relative size. As with the weight, the size is substantial, but it's nowhere near the size of another 43mm and 13mm watch that I have. (yes, it measures the correct dimensions, but this watch is crafted in a way where it tapers from the middle to the top and bottom in a very stylish manner making it appear smaller than the dimensions would otherwise lead you to believe.) Again still substantial, and a good comprise between the understated nature of a Patek and the monsterous quality of a Breitling (and yes, much cheaper than either of those as well, but just an example for purposes of comparison).\n\nOverall on size, I think it's a good balance. I would not imagine any adult male complaining about the watch's size (too big or too small) after a week or so of wearing it.\n\nBracelet/Band:  Looks like the picture. This particular band has 2 additional flat surfaces on each shiny link (the shiny center link is squared at the top and the bottom) compared to other watches that i own/have seen. It catches the light more than your standard band of this style which I like.  At a glance it looks a little different than the more common type of this watch band where the center shiny links have rounded edges. Admittedly, this is a very subtle difference.\n\nPerpetual calendar: Had to read the manual to figure out how to change the time, date, year, but once you figure it out, it's very logical. There is even a \"cheat sheet\" engraved on the back of the watch to remind you when the season's change and you don't feel like digging up the manual. The perpetual calendar is a nice feature so you only have to set the date once (and then whenever the battery runs out.) The bottom half moon dials tell you the date in regular time mode.\n\nChronograph: This watch uses the main hands as its chronograph which makes it very easy to read.  A little different than most other chronographs so a nice change if you collect watches, or if you hate all of the dials on the face of the watch but still want a chronograph.\n\nRagatta function: This is basically a countdown mode. It uses the hour and minute hand moving together counting down on the hours markers from 10 to 0. The thought here is that you get 10 minutes to set your boats up in a boat race and this watch counts those 10 minutes down for you. There is also apparently an additional 5 minutes that you get in the race that the watch can also countdown.  In all likelihood a completely worthless feature from a functionality perspective for nearly everyone who buys this watch, but its something your boss's watch probably won't do, for what that's worth.\n\nOverall:  The only complaint that I have is the type of links this watch uses. They are nearly impossible to remove yourself without risking bending a pin. Take it to a watch store to get that taken care of. The watch itself is very nice, and for amazon's price, I think you're getting an extremely good deal. Own a lot of watches, and spent a great deal of time researching this purchase, and I'm very pleased.",

                "review_body": "This watch is different. There is no manual adjustments. Everything is electronic and runs off the battery. Even the crown doesn't move the hour and minute hands. It has dual motors in it that perform all the movements. Everything is set by pressing the buttons and the battery in this is larger, and harder to find than most as a result. I had to go to batteries+ to get it.\n\nThis watch is on the lighter side but still heavy enough to indicate that it is solid. The dial does not move. It is for this weird regatta countdown that only is useful for people who sail and participate in sailboat racing.\n\nI do like the feel of this watch. The latch is nice and tight. The bracelet is very sharp looking and shines quite well after every polish. This watch will not scream luxury - it is more casual.\n\nWhat I don't like about this watch is that it gets out of sync and gets misaligned often. This is a problem for many people. I bought this over ten years ago and sent it in twice to get realigned. Turns out there is a factory reset function that allows you to realign all the hands to the zero position. Again, all done electronically. As simple as that might be, it does take about ten to fifteen minutes to do it and set the time again.\n\nI would not buy this watch again, and I don't think they even sell it anymore. It is a unique concept but a watch that costs this much should not need to be re calibrated a few times a year. It appears that Tag Heuer tried too hard to make all of this electronic and the complication of how to set it, multiple countdown functions, perpetual calendar, etc. and it didn't work out perfectly.",

The packaging is very well equipped I knew my watch was not damaged on the way and what was super cool is they sent me a FREE band to interchange!  My favorite thing about these watches is the low cost but high end quality. The one thing that stood out to me was the sapphire face on all their watches (scratch proof!!) while my other brand watches that are more expensive do not have this feature. I also found out that all the bands with Jace watches are interchangeable giving me more options of a different look with my watches. They are also waterproof! I don't have to worry when washing my hands, taking a shower or even swimming for that matter lol. And to put the cherry on top it meant a lot to me to know that they are donating proceeds to charities around the world. I also had questions about all the details to the watches and their customer service was great with fast response, I even got to speak with the guy who created the line of watches himself!! You will not be disappointed.",

Glass is raised and can make it a little difficult to read and on my watch seems  a little hazy, also there was a very very small mess up on my very top black dot at the 12 O\u2019clock position which is only Noticeable with a 10x  magnification, the black dot has some running with the ink or paint used, the counter weight is also a little heavy and doesn\u2019t seem very balanced like a lot of my other automatic watches. And the band is ok too the leather feels a little cheap with a very then layer of alligator skin sewn on. But once agin good for the price.",

                "review_body": "I have always been a fan of Rado timepiece.  I also owned a few other Rado watches.  My wife bought me this item as a gift.\n\nChoosing a timepiece, like clothing, is something very personal.  To me, the design of this watch is just irresistably beautiful, and the finish is flawless.  It immediately attracts eyes of my friends and colleagues at work the first day I wore it.  While it is not the cheapest timepiece around, it is \"only\" 1/6th of the Rolex Daytona Chronography that I was drooling.\n\nThe materials used in this watch (mostly high-tech ceremic and sapphire) is so hard that even after wearing it for a few months, it is still like new.  Not a single scratch yet.  I also have a similarly priced and equally beautiful Tag Heuer Carrera Carlibre 16 Automatic, which I wear it the same way (for work and during the weekend).  It is not as scratch resistance as this one.\n\nThe material is also very skin-friendly.  I am allergic to nickel-ricked stainless steel watches which cause rashes.  This one if fine for me.  It is an alternative to leather strap.\n\nThis watch is 45mm in diameter and is quite big and heavy.  It is suitable for rugged use.\n\nThe display has a faint luminated effect.  It grows in the dark and you can read the time even light is off.\n\nIt is an automatch watch, and it relies on our wrist movement to power the watch; otherwise, manually winding the watch is required to prevent from depleting the power reserve.\n\nWhen it comes to time accuracy, I start it together with the Tag Heuer (which also uses movement from the Swatch group, same company as Rado) that I own and measured them my mobile phone.  This Rado seems to be consistently a bit quicker after just a week (e.g., 30 seconds ahead of my mobile phone time and 10 seconds ahead of Tag).  I was told that it is as accurate as a PP, VC, AP, ALS, Rolex, etc., which each is easily about 6 - 20 times the price of this watch.\n\nThe stopwatch function is as good as any other high-end chronography watches in the market.  Nothing special.  It is comparable to the Tag Heuer that i owned. Some people may said it makes the dial a bit too busy for easy reading of the time. It is a personal preference and a matter of getting use to.\n\nPros: -\n1.) Beautiful design and finish;\n2.) Afforadable/value for money;\n3.) Friendly to skin (the back of this watch is sapphire crystal and the bracelet are made of ceremic) if you are allergic to stainless steel watches;\n4.) Scratch resistance;\n5.) It has a faint luminated effect on the dial and can tell time even in the dark;\n\nCons:\n1.) Big and heavy (unlikely to be an issue for those who have a big wrist);\n2.) It is an \"automatic\" and requires constant movement of wrist to power the movement (or you need to manually wind it regularly or get a watch winder);\n3.) It is a chronography watch which the dial-display can be a bit too busy for some people to read;\n\nGo down to a Rado shop and hold it in your hands.  You will want to take it home.",

It is very nice to look at but it broke (second hand fell of and got stuck) LITERALLY 1 month after I bought it. I am a doctor and only wear it to the office twice a week. Which means it broke after less than 10 days of use.\n\nI requested a refund from the company, they said no. I sent it in for a repair after I HAD TO PAY for shipping. It came back working, but then the second hand fell off again after 2 months, again with minimal use. I sent it again (Yes, after I had to pay AGAIN for shipping). It worked for about 2 more months until the second hand fell of again.\n\nI am not making any of this up. Please see the attached picture of what to expect: the second hand fell off and got stuck rendering the watch useless.\n\nDO NOT BUY this watch.",

He can wear it with his casual shirts/button downs and it doesn't look too flashy, but when he does get dressed it fits very well. He always gets compliments and people ask about his watch when they notice the mechanical face and he loves taking it off and showing them the back. He is an engineer and loves how this watch works.\n\nIt keeps pretty accurate time when it is moving. If you take it off and don't wear it for awhile you will have to reset the time. But once it's moving its accurate within a minute. He did have to take it to a jeweler to remove the extra link. They have instructions on how to pop it out but it is much more difficult than it looks. It's easier to have someone who knows what they're doing take it out.\n\nA great buy for the price. This was a starter watch for him and would be a great present for any teenager or young man.",

If a watch is too light i somehow feel im not getting my money's worth! Its a great looking watch, the face is clean, and the roman numerals are quite tasteful. The small second dial on the front is  a nice touch. It would have been too plain without that. The crown is marked with the RW logo, as is the back. Nice leather band, marked with the logo, as is the buckle. This watch is a winner and I highly reccomend this brand. Ive  been buying watches for 40 years.

                "review_body": "This is my third Raymond Weil watch and I'm a fan of the brand so my review might be a little biased.\n\nI really love this watch and I get lots of compliments when I wear it. I'd go as far as to say this is my favorite watch in my collection. As another reviewer said, pictures do not do it justice. It's very refined looking and elegant in an understated way. It's is a large watch but not it's uncomfortably large or heavy. However, it is large enough to make buttoning the sleeves of some brands of dress shirts almost impossible (no problems with French cuffs though). Not really an issue for me,  I just pick a shirt that works with the watch.\n\nThe only thing I really didn't like about this watch was the band. I don't have a really large wrist but the stock band on this watch looked tiny and cheap. Not what I'd expect on a watch that supposedly retailed for $1,250.00. Perhaps I got a watch set up for a market other than the US, I'm not sure. However, I swapped it out for a Hadley Roma contrast stitch band and it completely transformed the watch. Made it super stunning! Issue solved but that's a one star deduct since I had to buy a band for a brand new watch.\n\nThe only real problem I've had in a year of ownership is with the durability of the inner works. The watch slipped off my bed and fell onto a rug that was on a hardwood floor. That two foot fall knocked the hands out of alignment and jarred something inside that made the watch completely stop. I took it to my jeweler and he got it working again but now it's randomly stopping so it's back at the jeweler again. Hopefully he can find the problem and get it resolved this time. Since I caused the  issue I'm not deducting any stars but buyers need to be aware that these watches are quite fragile.\n\nOverall, I love the watch and if this one can't be repaired I'll consider buying another. I'll just be a lot more careful with the replacement.",

He's very picky about watches and after losing his Rolex didn't really want to replace it with anything that didn't match up to his eclectic style. He actually guided my decision with the style of watch he was looking for. I ended up choosing this one for the watch band. It arrives in a long wooden box which makes it look suspended in the air, which was a really nice touch. The watch itself is beautiful. The internal workings are interesting and enchanting, and the colors really play well off each other. It's fun that you can wind the watch, but you don't even need to do that because it works off the movement of your hand. My husband has yet to let it unwind completely. It's waterproof, he's worn it in the pool without damaging it.\n\nThe only minor complaint is that when the watch isn't snug against his wrist, the ticking can get pretty loud. Nothing deafening, of course (it's only a watch), but you can hear it when you're next to him on the couch.\n\nThis is such an awesome watch that I'm hoping Rougois makes a more slender version with a bracelet strap for me!",

The older version of the watch was quite finicky and i had to send it to a watch repair shop in Boston twice. It is chinese made with a fancy sounding european name \"Roujois\". It is nontheless a chinese made watch. After i had the watch store in boston fully tear it apart ,clean all components and put back together i never had another problem with it....until i lost it. I loved the watch so much i bought another one. It has a nice rhythmic licking sound when you hold it up to your ear, you an hear all the gears ticking etc. A nice watch if it holds togeher. unfortunatey if it breaks the only option you have is to mail it a a true watch repair shop. you can not take it to any jewelry store to have htem fix it",

I wanted to get a watch with a canvas band because I don't wanna buy leather but it has been shown that the bottom side of the band is made of leather as well as the little straps on the band.

Perhaps a note of caveat would be that the Kristerna glass is not as hard and shock and scratch resistant as one would expect given the manufacturers description of it. That aside, St\u00fchrling makes very reliable, elegantly designed and sturdy watches at a comfortable price range.\n\nThis unit, however, beautiful as it is, broke the pattern. I just retuned it four days ago because the chrono second hand would not zero at noon. On a subjective note, it was hard to read at a glance in lighting conditions less than bright. It is for this reason I haven't yet decided to order a replacement.",

The dial is fantastic, I couldn't tell beforehand if it was white or silver, and in person it is much the same. With daylight directly on the dial it's obviously silver, but in other light it typically looks white, giving the dial a bit of intrigue. The movement is fully decorated, with every visible surface dressed in some type of finishing. The circular cotes de Geneve on the backplate are mesmerizing.\n\nI opted for the bracelet, which is the most comfortable bracelet I own due to the small links.\n\nThe finish of every surface is flawless, and dial can be viewed nearly sideways through the domed sapphire crystal without interference.\n\n100% happy with my purchase. Bought this for myself to commemorate my Bachelor's degree, and I feel the level of quality is absolutely up to pat for such an occasion.\n\n- Update 7/2016 -\nHave had the watch for a fee months now, it is keeping excellent time. I do keep it on a winder when not in use. Also bought a 21mm leather strap that compliments the watch nicely.",

I had to buy out of faith and I'm satisfied with my descision. The only thing I would say that is misleading about the advertising is that the watche's face or background (the poppy flowers) is slightly different on the watch than the picture. To be more specific the \"ZIZ\" logo in the photo is on the top right. On the actual watch it's on the top left, the flowers aren't the exact same as shown in the photo, and the hour markers in the photo are black dots with white centers. In reality they're just black dots. Overall it's a decent watch for the price you pay because the face isn't really important when buying a watch.",

The warranties on gray market watches come from the seller, not the manufacturer.  What you have to ask yourself is this:  Do I want to purchase a special, \"limited edition\" (10,007 watches were produced) that doesn't have a valid Omega warranty card with it?  This is not to say that there is anything at all wrong with the watch.  But Omega won't fix any problems with it.  And you are totally dependent upon the seller for service.  As for myself, if I were going to purchase a limited edition watch, I would want ALL of the paperwork to come with it, to include the original warranty cards.  I understand that purchasing a \"gray market\" watch can save you some money, but the savings may not always be worth it.  I've never purchased anything from this seller, and have nothing negative to state except that I don't think that a \"collectible watch\" that was purchased on the gray market is going to hold the same value as one with the original warranty card.  It's also a lot of money for a watch that no authorized Omega service center would work on.",

I was on the market for something simple and elegant to wear on business trips, and this thing fit the bill perfectly.\n\nOnly cons are related to the band.\n\nIMO, the original band looked and felt a little cheap, but that's not the reason I bought the watch.\n\nAlso, you'll need to buy a 20mm band. I bought a 19mm originally, and it didn't fit properly.\n\nIt's super minor, but that one extra millimeter of empty space was the only thing I could focus on whenever I looked down, and it pissed me off for weeks until I caved and bought another band. ??\n\nNeedless to say, amazing watch, and has done wonders for me. People will notice that you're starting to pay attention to the small details in life, and it will lead to more opportunity than you could ever imagine.",

I was very skeptical about it when I saw the picture, but the watch was beautiful. The dealer of the watch was also very very helpful when I called them about information, and he was very assuring about quality and genuinity. My husband loved the watch. Thank you for all the help.

I love the physical appearance of the watch, the bright orange bezel, the beautifully made dial and luminous Super-LumiNova applied to the indexes on the dials and hands which shows up nicely in the dark. My favourite part of the watch is it has a transparent sapphire crystal case back to see the co-axial 8500 movements which personally is a nice feature. It has automatic winding in both directions and has a Power reserve of about 60 hours which is great as I wear this watch most days! It looks nice on my wrist, feels great and is quite weighty. I have received a lot of compliments at work from customers and collegues since purchasing it.",

I have been wearing it every day and it's been very accurate, I did have omega regulate it to run +1 sec a day and it's been very precise. The quality is superb and feels very sturdy, pretty heavy but not too bad. There was a few things I didn't like at first but now I'm fine with them. The bracelet couldn't fit my wrist perfectly since there isn't a micro adjustable clasp. It was either too tight or too lose. I had to buy an extra half link from omega in order to get the right fitment. Now all is well. Second thing is, the anti reflective crystal can easily smudge but it looks amazing when it's clean. I also hear it the AR coating can scratch but mine has been okay so far. I have a tint scratch in the middle that is only visible with certai. Light/angles so it's not bothering me at all. Overall, great watch. Lived up to my expectations.",

It is a calibre 6 automatic....amazon lists this as a calibreS which is incorrect.\nThe watch looks even better than the photos. After a few weeks, the automatic movement has settled in nicely to just 1-3 seconds of time gain a day. This is well within COSC specs without the COSC price.\nSlightly faster is easy to deal with(easy to adjust since it is faster, not slower).\n\nBuying direct from Amazon is recommended.",

This is not the first stuhrling watch I have purchased, and so far I haven\u2019t had problems with the quality. This watch arrived in a think orange sturhling box. It\u2019s padded to protect the watch during shipment and it makes for a nice presentation if you\u2019re giving the watch as a present. The watch face is also covered with plastic to protect it from scratching.\nI gave this to my boyfriend as a birthday present. He loves it and get\u2019s compliments on it every time he wears it. The look is so classy and I like watching all the components of the skeleton watch. Also, because the arms of the watch are blue they\u2019re very easy to see so you can read the time. I feel like if they were silver they would get lost on the watch face- so I think the color is a great touch.\n\nThis watch is an automatic watch, which means it doesn\u2019t have a battery and it needs to be wound. This watch is kinetic, so as you wear it throughout the day the watch automatically winds itself which is a neat feature. The downside of this is that if you let the watch sit for too long, it\u2019ll stop and you\u2019ll have to reset the watch.\n\nThe one thing I will say is that this watch face is on the large side and because the band is also metal it\u2019s a pretty heavy watch. The metal band is also big, we had to remove a few links for it to fit him well and he\u2019s a fairly large man. If you have small wrists I wouldn\u2019t recommend this watch, but otherwise it\u2019s fantastic.\n\nOverall I think this is a great product and it would make a fantastic gift. I\u2019m very happy I was able to purchase this watch at a promotional rate in exchange for my honest review.",

                "review_body": "Its a looker of a watch, and is extremely reliable.... when its working.\n\nPurchased in June, 2014 through a cruise line, and the one I got out of the box was defective.  It simply would not keep time correctly at all.  So when I got home, I called up Stuhrling customer service, and they were very nice and extremely helpful.  As long as you are within 90 days of purchase, Stuhrling will replace your watch, no questions asked, and will cover the full cost of shipping, so for those purchasing on Amazon, that is a very nice backup to have.\n\nThe replacement I got works very well, and keeps impressively accurate timing.  The only drawbacks I've seen are if you keep it in one position too long (especially if the face is horizontal) it will stop, so wearing it overnight sometimes will lead you to having to set the time in the morning.  However, for the most part it usually behaves extremely well, and does a good job in keeping itself wound through the course of the day.  The automatic ticking of it isn't too bad, and you rarely hear it during the day unless it catches your ear at the right angle, but it can be a little annoying at night if you don't have any white noise to drown it out.\n\nWith all that said, the one I got has a different face than the one shown here, despite being the same model.  The innards of mine are all silver, and not the Rose gold seen here.  I suspect this is an error in the photoshopping of the watches when showing the different colors available.\n\nIn the end, I absolutely love this watch, and recommend it to anyone.  I rarely go out and not get a compliment on it by those who see it.",

Breitling's service center claimed \"impact.\"  Totally untrue ... there was no impact and wasn't the slightest bit of evidence of impact - no scrathes, scuffs or marks of any kind.  It just broke.  So, the company did not stand behind its warranty and charged a fortune for the repair.  As a pilot for many years I was excited to get my first Breitling.  Now I'm afraid to wear the watch for normal everyday use and will attempt to trade it in for a more durable timepiece (and will never purchase another Breitling).  It looks great, but will not last.",

One is the material of the bezel which is very sensitive and scratch very easily. I do care for my watches but it is surprising how easily can scratch. The other issue has to do with the accuracy. It is very fast on my wrist and slow on the auto winder. Of course it is a mechanical watch but 5-6 seconds a day is not what someone expect when buying a Breitling. My Omega Planet Ocean Big blue is more accurate. And even my Raymond Weil Freelancer is also very accurate, of approximately 0-1 sec per day. So careful when you decide to buy. Big caution to avoid scratches, although in the course of time inevitably several will occur.",

                "review_body": "If you are like me, then you enjoy researching big ticket items as much as the purchase.  I can't say that it eliminates buyer's regret but the hangover doesn't last nearly as long.  I purchased the Omega Planet Ocean 6 months ago with some trepidation because of the price and a bad experience that I once had with a Rolex.  I was concerned about the price because it cost considerably more than the Omega Seamaster.  The Seamaster is also a diver's watch and has a proven track record.  In fact, the watch that James Bond* wore in Casino Royale was a special edition quartz Seamaster. In this review, I will attempt to answer the following questions:\n\nIs it worth paying more money for a Planet Ocean, than for it's predecessor, the Seamaster?\n\nHow does the Planet Ocean stack up to more expensive competitor, Rolex Sea Dweller?\n\n*Note: James Bond wore the Planet Ocean in a Quantum of Solace.\n\nWhile conducting this review, I'll also try to educate the novice on the basic components of a watch: bezel, movement, band, crystal, case, and the face (dial, marker, hands).  Without understanding each of these components, you cannot accurately compare watches. Of course, there are other factors as well as intangibles to be taken into consideration (warranty, prestige, price, etc.).\n\n1.  The crystal is the transparent cover that allows one to view the time while protecting the face of the watch from damage.  The difference in quality and price varies according to the scratch resistance (hardness) of the crystal and the anti-reflective coating that have become standard on high end diver's watches.  Any watch costing more than $150 will generally have one of three crystals: Mineral, Sapphire, and Ceramic.  All Rolex and Omega watches come with Sapphire or Ceramic.  Ceramic (yttrium-stabilized zirconia) is the newest and most technologically advanced material.  For the sake of concision, the minor advantages of a ceramic bezel aren't worth the premium price at this time.\n\nThe Planet Ocean and all of the competing diving watches in this class come with sapphire crystal. Sapphire crystal is aptly named because it's literally a lab produced corundum. For those of you who are not gemologists, sapphires and rubies are fancy names for red and blue corundum!  Corundum has a 9 on the Mohs hardness scale (diamond = 10). Ergo, nothing below 9 on the Mohs hardness scale should easily scratch it.  I'm very hard on watches but still haven't managed to scratch the P.O.'s sapphire crystal.  The harder a substance, the more brittle it is, therefore, you're be just as likely to shatter a sapphire crystal than scratch it. If the crystal is raised (i.e. Sea Dweller), the exposed edge is also susceptible to being chipped.  Fortunately, this is not a problem with the Planet Ocean since the sapphire crystal sits flush with the stainless steel bezel (replaceable).\n\nBesides the way the sapphire crystals are mounted, the chief differences between diving watches involve the anti-reflective coating, or lack thereof. The Omega Seamaster and the Rolex Sea Dweller both put the anti-reflective coating on the inside of the crystal while the Planet Ocean has translucent blue tinted anti-reflective coating on both the outside and inside of the crystal. Note: You can only see the 'blue tint' by tilting the watch at an angle.  Before purchasing this watch, I read an amateur review from a Sea Dweller owner who stated that Omega made a mistake because the exterior anti-reflective coating leaves noticeable marks when scratched.  I've found that criticism to be highly exaggerated. In fact, I wear this watch daily and have put some scratches on the band but cannot find any marks on the coating.  If you are actually going to use this watch for it's intended purpose (scuba diving), then you will absolutely want to have this exterior coating because it works much better than the interior coating alone!  IMHO, I love the crystal's signature bluish hue because it's the simplest way to distinguish an authentic P.O. from a cheap forgery.\n\n2. Movement is the 'motor' of the watch that keeps the time, date, etc.  Each separate mechanical function of a watch is called a 'complication'.  With premium watches, you generally have three choices when it comes to movement: Quartz, winding, and automatic.  Quartz watches are more accurate and less expensive, but require batteries.  Question:  Why would anyone with half a brain want an automatic watch then?  Answer: Multiple reasons! While automatic and winding movements are less practical and generally require more maintenance over the long haul, the difference is the artistry, ingenuity, and elegance of a mechanical movement.  This is where the Omega Planet Ocean surpasses virtually every other watch out there including the Rolex Sea Dweller. The Caliber 2500 movement is based on an ETA 2892-2 (ETA is owned by the same company, Swatch group that owns Omega).  Several innovations make this 27 jewel movement extraordinary.  Due to the 'Co-Axial Displacement' the self winding (automatic) movement has managed to substantially reduce friction, thus requires much less lubrication than any other automatic movements manufactured today! What that means to you, my friend is that your new Planet Ocean watch will not require expensive servicing for 10 YEARS! FYI, that's twice as long as any Rolex. The drastically reduced friction within the movement also doubles the lifespan of the watch! Additionally, Caliber 2500 movement has been equipped with a 'free sprung balance' that's a 'state of the art' simplified regulating system which greatly improves the COSC timing precision.  In other words, this watch keeps exceptionally accurate time for a mechanical watch.  In my experience, this watch has kept almost perfect time +/- 1 second a day and under 2 seconds a week.  FYI: All mechanical watches tend to run fast by a few seconds per week during the first 6 to 18 months because of the initial factory lubrication. As the lubrication thins and spreads, high end mechanical watches generally become more accurate. Since the P.O. doesn't need as much lubrication, the accuracy out of the box is amazing.  It's the only mechanical watch that I've owned that's lived up to it's billing when it comes to keeping time.\n\n3.  Case:  The Omega Planet Ocean's case is beautiful, rugged, and well designed with twice the water resistance rating of the Seamaster at 600m/1200ft. While that's half of the water resistance of the Rolex Sea Dweller, it's a moot point since the diving depth record with a breathing apparatus is only 313m!  To give you a reference point, the most advanced atomic submarine (US Sea Wolf class) has a maximum diving depth of 500 meters.  Omega invented the helium release value that made watches better suited for longer deeper dives.  Without it, the pressure change upon returning to the surface would pop out the crystal. On the Planet Ocean, the release value is manual and looks like another winding clasp but is inscribed 'He' (the scientific symbol for helium). FYI- the safety value doesn't need to be deployed for normal swimming and diving.\n\nOh yeah, I almost forgot to mention the beautiful depiction of the Omega sea monster [hippokampoi] is on the case back.  Not only is it attractive, but it's the easiest way to determine if the watch is a genuine Planet Ocean.  While counterfeit watches don't seem to have trouble imitating the Rolex green hologram sticker, I've searched the internet and have never seen a convincing forgery of the Omega sea monster on the back case.  If you don't believe me, then go to the fake watch sites on the internet and do a comparison.  The counterfeiters know that most people who purchase counterfeit watches are only interested in fooling passive onlookers.\n\n4. On the Planet Ocean, the bezel is the black or orange 'coin edged' unidirectional rotating stainless steel ring that surrounds the crystal.  The Omega Planet Ocean's 'easy grip' bezel has 120 clicks (stopping points) stopping precisely on the markers.  FYI:  If you are diving with this watch, then the bezel is one of the most important features. For others who simply enjoy the styling and durability of a diving watch, the bezel provides a quick way to determine the quality, precision, and attention to detail that was put into the watch.\n\n5.  The band is the least important feature of a watch as far as I'm concerned.  The band can be changed and will probably be replaced long before the watch dies of natural causes.  Nevertheless, an expensive watch should come with a solid clasped high grade stainless steel, gold, or titanium band (I abhor leather and plastic).  The Omega Planet Ocean's band is first rate.  I found the it to be very comfortable and secure with no sharp edges. The clasping mechanism works flawlessly. Being that it is a diving watch, the clasp has a clever mechanism that painlessly extends the band to allow it to fit over a diving suit (or jacket sleeve). Fortunately, the band is brushed stainless steel so it doesn't show scratches like the polished case.\n\n6. Face (dial, marker, hands)-  The Planet Ocean's hands and makers are coated with Superluminova resin.  That means that when you turn out the lights, you do not have trouble making out the time for 30 minutes or so.  The arrow tipped hands distinguish the Planet Ocean from the Sea Master and the Ocean Dweller. Another cool feature is that you can distinguish the hands from one another even at 12:00! The date does not require magnification.  I've always felt that magnified dates aka cyclops interferes with the elegance of a watch. While this is a matter of personal preference, many people must agree since Rolex does not include the cyclops on the Sea Dweller.\n\nFinally, I must mention the size.  The Planet Ocean is a relatively big watch at 45.5mm and weighs 9oz.  I like bigger watches but it's a matter of taste.  I'm a large man (6'3\" 210lbs) so it fits me proportionally.  For someone with a smaller frame or thinner wrists, Omega makes a slightly diminutive version (42mm) of the standard PO.  Whichever version you choose, the Plane Ocean will never be mistaken for a lady's watch!\n\nCONCLUSION:  While the PO does cost more than the Seamaster, I believe that it's well worth the extra price because of the improved movement and styling. You are also paying $5000 less than the Sea Dweller. I love my Planet Ocean and highly recommend it.",

                "review_body": "I am rather opinionated when it comes to luxury watches.  This comes from spending 2 years in watchmaking school, studying directly under the guidance of a certified master swiss watchmaker who came here from Europe.  Watches, especially mid to high grade swiss watches, are a passion of mine.  I am not loyal to a brand or a style or anything else.  I judge them for what they are, in terms of quality, function, construction, and style.  A watchmakers point of view.\n\nThis said I will tell you that this particular watch is what I consider to be a \"best kept secret\" sort of watch.  This is an AUTOMATIC watch (read: Mechanical - NOT Quartz), and of CHRONOMETER grade function.  Chronometer as used here is a measure of accurate timekeeping, not quality - a point often misunderstood - and is used mostly from a marketing point of view by companies such as Rolex.  HOWEVER.  This movement in THIS watch is actually EXCELLENT in terms of quality, time keeping ability, and construction - easily comparable to other Swiss made movements from other famous manufacturers costing several times as much.  This watch, properly serviced, will provide a lifetime of use - and probably more.  Absolutely the sort of watch you pass down to the next generation.\n\nAll in all - and EXCELLENT choice - especially for those seeking their first QUALITY Swiss watch purchase.\n\nDefinitely recommended!",

                "review_body": "I have a couple of luxury watches - a Girard Perregaux that I use for formal occasions and a Tag Heuer for everyday use. The steel band on my Tag broke, and I used that as an excuse to finally upgrade. I considered a Rolex, Cartier (Roadster), Breitling, Omega, or another GP. After prowling around luxury watch forums/reviews, I settled on the Omega SPS as having the best value for the money. Rolex makes great watches, but they're so ubiquitous with so many fakes floating around that it doesn't feel \"special\". Cartier seems to be widely panned by luxury watch afficionados - apparently its mechanism is so sensitive that it must be sent in to Cartier for routine maintenance every 3-5 years at a cost of $700 a pop!! The Breitling models I liked have monstrous sizes...they looked incongrous on my 7\" wrist. In the end, I settled on the Omega SPS - and I believe I made the right decision. It's gorgeous - it looks and feels substantitive without looking pretentious. The red/orange 6, 9, and 12 numbers on the dial catches the eye. I think this is a great luxury watch for everyday use. It certainly feels like it can take a lot of abuse.",

                "review_body": "Make sure to get the one with non-red markers, James Bond wears the version with all white markers.  James Bond also wears the XL version (45.5mm case)  And obviously, he doesn't wear the one with the orange bezel (yeeech).  There are two versions of this watch coming out just like for the last James Bond watch.  But seriously, do you think James Bond would wear a watch that says \"Quantum of Solace\" or \"007\" engraved in back of his watch?  Seriously.  Do yourself a favor and get NOT get the limited edition, but the regular model.  But I guess people buy for different reasons.\n\nHaving said that, this is a great, practical watch for everyday wear if you want to look cool with a touch of class.  I would not wear this for sports or to the gym because I like to keep my watches in near mint condition.  The price is not awfully expensive as a Rolex but works possibly even better and looks just as great as a Rolex.  I'm very suprised how much the Omega Seamaster is beginning to look more and more like a Rolex Submariner.  The last Seamaster is quite distintive in that it's Bond version has a blue face with a nice geometrically carved bezel and intricate bracelet band (but not to everyone's tastes).  Now, for the Planet Ocean, we see the famous fluted bezel that is signature of Rolex.  We see the Bond version is all black a la Bond Rolex Submariner.  And gone also is the intricate-looking band which now looks very much like the Rolex Oyster bracelet with just a slightly different line of design.  There are some differences.  The PO case is quite elegant and very reminiscent of car body design.  However, the side profile of the case still lacks the elegance of Rolex.  Another obvious difference is the size.  The Rolex Submariner is 40mm which is perfect for any wrist.  Last Seamster Professional was 41mm which is still perfect.  This watch?  A whopping 45.5mm!!!  It's huge.  Make sure you are fine with the size.  With a large diametered case also comes the added weight!  I love the nice heft but this may not be suitable for everyone.  Although many of these differences are quite subjective, what is pretty much objective is the clasp of these watches.  Time and time again, people complain why the most famous all watches come with a flimsy, cheap clasp?  Omega Seamaster clasp totally blows it away as it is very solid and quite easy to operate.\n\nSo now we have an Omega that looks and feels much like a Rolex.  Omega is like the Lexus of watches.  It does a lot of things great and maybe even better but it will always be second status to Rolex a la Lexus to Mercedes.  No matter how hard Lexus tries to be a Mercedes, it will always be a Lexus.  With that said, both Lexus and Omega make solid, quality products with a more affordable price tag.  Give this, I would wear an Omega practicially everyday and just leave the special occasions for my Rolex Submariner.  However if you are really particular on wanting the very best, you may want to be a bit more patient in saving for that Rolex.  I gave so many reasons to buy this watch but the only reason to buy a Rolex is because it's a Rolex!",

                "review_body": "I love this watch. The 2201.51 (black bezel / orange numerals) was given to me as a gift and I have not taken it off since I received it. I don't track how accurate it is to the second like some people do, but suffice to say that it is very very accurate, and I believe what others have said about this movement.\n\nThere are three things I absolutely love about this watch.\n\nFirst, the clarity: It is about as clear and easy to read as I have ever had. Irrespective of light, a quick glance will always tell me the time. In dark light, the superluminova makes it very easy. I suspect this has to do with antireflective coating on both sides of the sapphire and all that tech stuff but frankly, all I care for is the end value to me.\n\nSecond, the fit and finish of the case and bracelet are absolutely top notch. Its almost a work of art because of the amount of detail in the watch. Everything from the hippocampus engraving in the back to the placement of the crowns. Everything is \"just\" right and it feels very natural.\n\nThird, despite the fact that this is technically a sports watch (I swim once in a while and keep it on), I wear it to work and dressy occasions. Since its not super flashy and I usually wear long cuffs, people don't usually notice  it. Frankly, I like that it goes under the radar like that. That said, twice someone did comment on it, and both times they knew exactly what it was! Must be watch affectionados.\n\nNeedless to say, I love this watch and wear it everyday. If you have the money, it is definitely worth the price of entry. I'm not a collector so for me, I don't think I'll be purchasing another watch anytime soon.\n\nUPDATE AFTER 1 YEAR: Still loving this timepiece. It ticks away and is quite accurate. I have made the mistake of trying to reset the time (while travelling) near 12 and the watch gave me a warning sign with a \"click\"...so I'll be careful not to do that anymore. The 48hour charge is accurate. When I leave it sitting, it will go about 2 days before stopping. Outside of that; it ticks away quite reliably. I must say that over the course of the last year, this watch has really grown on me. I am enjoying it more today than I did when I first got it...which I believe is a testament to the seemingly obsessive workmanship that goes into its production.",

I originally paired it with an iPhone 6 and then a pixel 2. Both worked fine. I get compliments all the time, and the filtered notifications and minimalist functions are excellent. These guys apparently build the entire watch and accompanying app from the ground up.\nI would also recommend checking out the Google play store app reviews which are quite high and speak to how great this watch and company are.",

                "review_body": "Just got this over the weekend. Looks very majestic, feels great to wear. Looks way better in hand than what the picture at the Amazon site shows. The dial is more Platinum-silver in color than what looks like pure white in the picture at site. The watch gives an impression of aristocracy and fine craftsmanship. How it performs over long period is something to be seen. I'll post updates here later. There are are a lot of sites that sells this watch. But buyers beware as internet is washed with counterfeits. I bought it from Amazon because I trust Amazon. So should you.\n\n07/02/15: Update - I've been wearing this watch all these months. Still looks as elegant and great as did when it was brand new out of the box. I don't wear it all the time but at least for 3 days a week, to match with rest of my outfit. I use other watches on other days. Here are few observations to share. When it was brand new out of the box, the leather strap was very stiff to wrap around the wrist. It took quite a bit of wearing to get the strap to conform to my wrist shape. While on that topic, because the watch's leather strap is traditional buckle type, you need to be careful when wearing it or taking it off, as it might slip off and fall to the ground. I dropped it twice that way but luckily, it fell on carpet and the watch didn't sustain any damage or scratch from that. You don't want any damage to happen to such a fine, expensive timepiece. Also, I suggest you invest in a good watch winder to keep it on motion when you are not wearing for few days or so. I use the Brookstone's winder. Very quiet machine. Another thing I have noticed that it gains a minute or so every 30 days. This is not unusual for automatic watches. I have another Tissot automatic watch and that gains about 2 minutes every few weeks to a month or so. Bottom line, this is a beautiful piece of jewelry for a man to own and wear.  Two thumbs up from me.",

This time they said the mechanism needs lubed, and instead of free it now cost me $760 for the repair on top of the $30 to ship it to RW in NYC.  Will never waste this money on a RW again.

So far its been keeping perfect time. I'm pleased with my purchase.",

It will get water vapor under the crystal if you even wash your hands. Also, it has almost no reserve power. If you don't wear it one half day it will stop.

If you want a true luxury watch, buy a Omega!  The 2220.80.00 is commonly known as the \"Bond Watch\" (as seen in the past four 007 movies).  This Seamaster 300m Co-Axial Chonometer is a great luxury watch, stylish and manly.  Be careful to learn about Authorized Dealers vs. \"Grey Market\" watches.  ALL Omegas sold online are \"Grey Market\" since Omega does not allow internet sales, hence your warranty will probably not be honored by Omega directly but by some watch company (beware!).  Want to learn more about luxury watches check out Timezone.com before buying to make sure you get the right watch.  I got the watch for my 40th Birthday (Thanks Steve!) and I love it!",

The watch itself is gorgeous: the blue waves are great looking, the luminescent hands and markers work even in the daytime and the bracelet is extremely comfortable.

I probably wear it 60% of the time.  I feel complexity reduces reliability so I chose this over watches with more funtions.  It will initally feel a bit heavy but you adjust to that very quickly.  I have had absolutely no issues with it.  The rotating Bezel does require more force than you expect.  I'm sure that is by design.  The glowing hands are great for the movie theater.\nOmegas are a bit different.  Other Omega watch wearers will say things to you about it.  There is sometimes an expectation that you know something about your watch and other watches if you wear an Omega. Not a lot but it happens.

First, my watch shipped from Amazon, so I can't vouch for watches that come from Amazon's partner websites.  In short, the watch arrived as I expected new in the original box with all docs including the warranty card and operating instructions.  As others have mentioned, Omega might not acknowledge the warranty on this watch because it was not purchased through an authorized dealer.  Instead, Amazon provides a 2-year warranty.  I decided the price difference between amazon.com and an authorized dealer was significant enough to justify going with Amazon.  The watch is 100% real with serial numbers intact.  Overall, this is a beautiful watch; I've even received compliments on it from strangers.  If you are looking for a full sized sports watch, I'd recommend this Omega; you won't be disappointed.",

I took it to the Swatch Service Center in Toronto, and in 20 minutes they had it adjusted perfectly--for free, as it was in warranty.  It now gains 1 - 2 seconds a day, and that's outstanding accuracy for a mechanical watch.\n\nThis watch is very handsome and has an easy to read dial.  The band is very comfortable, and is noted for not pulling hairs like some watch bands.  The watch does not \"wander\" on your arm like some; it stays perfectly centered on my wrist.  The sapphire crystal shrugs off encounters that would leave an ordinary watch crystal dinged or scratched.\n\nI think the movement is the most advanced of any mechanical movement in the world.  It is accurate and requires less frequent maintenance than similar brands.\n\nOmega has hit a home run with its co-axial escapement movement and its Seamaster series.  I have the \"Quantum of Solace\" Planet Ocean Seamaster model, and it is also superbly accurate--and handsome.  I don't see why anyone would want to pay thousands more for a Rolex, or for one of those \"avant garde\" pieces that no \"man of action\" would be caught dead wearing!",

This comes from spending 2 years in watchmaking school, studying directly under the guidance of a certified master swiss watchmaker who came here from Europe.  Watches, especially mid to high grade swiss watches, are a passion of mine.  I am not loyal to a brand or a style or anything else.  I judge them for what they are, in terms of quality, function, construction, and style.  A watchmakers point of view.\n\nThis said I will tell you that this particular watch is what I consider to be a \"best kept secret\" sort of watch.  This is an AUTOMATIC watch (read: Mechanical - NOT Quartz), and of CHRONOMETER grade function.  Chronometer as used here is a measure of accurate timekeeping, not quality - a point often misunderstood - and is used mostly from a marketing point of view by companies such as Rolex.  HOWEVER.  This movement in THIS watch is actually EXCELLENT in terms of quality, time keeping ability, and construction - easily comparable to other Swiss made movements from other famous manufacturers costing several times as much.  This watch, properly serviced, will provide a lifetime of use - and probably more.  Absolutely the sort of watch you pass down to the next generation.\n\nAll in all - and EXCELLENT choice - especially for those seeking their first QUALITY Swiss watch purchase.\n\nDefinitely recommended!",

It's less then 1/2 of the price of a basic Rolex(hey! don't lough at Rolex!)\nSpeaking of prices:\nDo shop around! It's not a new model, prices vary greatly. Even here on Amazon it changes a lot.Used to be 200 bucks less a couple of months ago as far as I remember.Maby they found a more reliable dealer,or maby for other reasons.Buy online without a warranty? Your decision.These are reliable, meticulously tested watches,but still..Buy internationally?get the international warranty then.\nI got my 2220 here in Poland.It sells usually for the company's sugested price:3,300$ or a little more. But you can get discounts up to 15-20% if you ask for it.Mine was an exposition piece for 15 months, in perfect conditions though(fingerprints of customers wiped away)and since the dealer was certified by omega:with all the warranty cards and the chronometer certificate card and whatever else.\nI got 30% discount on it (paid about 2,400 US$).This way I saved about 950 dollars which will be spent for presents for the less economicaly lucky members of my family.

The watch is not light but I wouldn't call it heavy either, especially for a 300 meter dive watch.\n\nThe watch is a work of art; the lines and details are fantastic.  In photos the bracelet looked a little too busy to for my taste so I intended to buy the Planet ocean, after trying both on I changed my mind, the comfort, style and the streamlined feel of the 300m sold me.  There are a million Submariner look-alike watches in the world, the Omega Seamaster is NOT one of them, it is truly unique.\n\nThe mechanical movement has been great (adding about 2 seconds per day.) the clasp is solid and built to last, the bezel feels great and I love the wave-cut design around the edge.  The 41 mm face is the perfect size for me, it will be the standard for any watch I purchase in the future.\n\nTo me the negatives are small but they include the hands and the lume.  The Skeletonized hands look great and make for a clean watch face but they are difficult to read at night.  The Illumination is average and the small lumme points on the hands are nearly unreadable in the dark.  Nevertheless I love this watch and I am very pleased with my purchase.",

I get compliments all the time on it.  The only watch that people like better is my 18K Vacheron Constantin.\n\nThe Omega is priced very well for what you get.  I own watches that cost more and cost less and this one is a superstar.  If you're considering a Rolex, buy this instead.  You'll get a better watch for less money and in my opinion it makes more of a statement.  If you prefer Dom P\u00e9rignon over Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin La Grande Dame even though it doesn't taste as good, you'll buy the Rolex and I can't help you.\n\nCheers!",

                "review_body": "I actually own this specific watch (#2220.80.00) and is my 2nd Omega (have five year old Speedmaster). It is a beautiful watch and like other Omegas you get comments on it. If you have not owned an Omega then you will be impressed by the feel and quality of the watch. For these kind of watches it doesn't feel heavy at all but a comfortable feel to it when wearing. Accuracy? Let's face it, a cheap $20 quartz is more accurate but it is rated a chronometer (don't confuse the term chronograph with lots of dials) and I gain 2 seconds a day. This is good because it is easy to update but stopping the clock a few seconds a day and watches tend to slow until the next cleaning. The Co-Axial feature is not a gimick (look at the Omega site for an animation on how this works) and results in the watch being certified a chronometer. Compared to my older non-coaxial Speedmaster (new ones have coaxial) here are my observations:\n*With my older automatic you could feel the automatic movement as it spun around when wearing it. The Seamaster doesn't have that moment and is quiet. When listening to it much more pleasant than the Speedmaster but I know most would say who cares.\n*With my older automatic when you did rewind it it would offer a lot of resistance and almost cut into your thumb. The new one offers just a little resistance but rewinds the watch. You could wind it all day without getting callouses.\n\nAs for as warrenty: Others have pointed out that you lose one year of warrenty if you buy it through Amazon. I also think you may not get the card that certifies it is a chronometer which may be important for some and not for others. I bought it through the Navy exchange military store but of course not an option for some. The advantage is that the military is a certified Omega seller.\n\nOnly negative (maybe not for some): The watch dial is really more black than blue as shown in the picture...looks more like black wave not blue wave. OK, maybe it is a dark Navy blue. Still not a deal breaker for this watch. Good value for the price. I've found I didn't really need all the \"bells and whistles\" of my chronogragh Speedmaster. If you need reading glasses nice to have big broad dials such as this watch which is easy to read.",

                "review_body": "I have been looking at this watch for quite sometimes now. I was having difficulity deciding between the Automatic and Quartz versions. The advantage of this one is that I do not need to replace the battery every 1-2 years. Amazon seems to be out of stock for this one for quite sometimes now and I do not trust the third party sellers since buying from the internet void the Omega warranty.\n  I went to a local jeweler one day and it happens that they are having a sale. The local jeweler can be found as an authorized dealer on Omega and fully cover by the Omega warranty. I decided to bite the bullet and bought it. I am glad I did. Here are a few thought on the watch.\n\n- The watch is very solid and robust\n- The watch seem a little bit heavier then my previous watches\n- The watch is very accurate so far. only 1 -2 sec runs faster then the atomic clock every day.\n- The color and style stands out and it can be wear on any occasion. causal/dress suite\n- This same exact watch worn by James Bond in Casino Royale when he was playig poker at the casino ( the beginning of the movie he was wearing the Seamaster Planet Ocean with rubber strap)\n- According to omega you only need to service it every 4- 5 years for normal use.\n- Bracelet has a quick extension feature to accomodate diver wetsuit.\n\na few things to keep in mind - note these are not negative thoughts\n\n-Like any automatic watch it will not be always accurate. Many owners on the Internet have reported their Seamasters often far exceed COSC standards in daily use. Be prepare to adjust the time every now and then. In reality we have the adjust twice a year for day light saving time anyway. I do not mind at all\n- May need to manually wind it if you dont wear it  for long period of time. I recommend buying a watch winder for people who wear the watch occasionally.\n- the helium relief vaulve is useless in my opinion even with the any form of normal suba diving. but it is a unique feature to the watch so I dont mind.\n- may be expensive to service the watch and may require sending it to authorized omega repair center.\n\nOver all this is an excellent watch. I would highly recommend this watch to anyone who is looking for a watch in this price range",

                "review_body": "I've owned my \"James Bond\" Automatic Mov't Omega for 9 years.  I own 1 other Omega, but this one is my everyday watch.  I've had no problems at all.  It's never been serviced and still keeps near perfect time, gains 2 or 3 seconds every 6 or 7 days.  I have had it pressure tested twice over the years.  The last time was 2 years ago.  Still as tight as ever.  My only complaint.  The rotating bezel on mine is extremely stiff and somewhat difficult to turn, and the edge bevels are not really pronounced enough to give you good grip.  The only evident wear and tear on mine is typical hairline scratches on the band and clasp.  The watch case, crown, and crystal still appear flawless, and this is my everyday watch.  A few comments about the warranty.  The Standard Manufacturer's Warranty is only 1 year, after that your own own, unless you purchase the extended Amazon Warranty.  Personally, like most extended warranties, I don't think it's necessary.  If the watch works when you receive it, then it will still be working a year later, 2 years later, etc.  And note that the warranties do not cover accidental breakage or damage.  I also feel the same way about \"General Maintenance/Servicing\". If it's not broke don't fix it.  If it's not keeping good time, then look into getting serviced.  The recommended \"service intervals\" are just a good way to lift some money from your pocket.  \"Grey Market Vendors...\", I see no problem in purchasing from an internet vendor as long as you do your research and know they are reputable.  You will save plenty over what you would pay in a regular store front jewelry store.  I purchased mine over the internet and saved $800 over what the local jewelry stores were charging, plus the savings on sales tax....  I decided not to worry about not having any true warranty because the vendor had a 30 day money back gurantee.  Like I said, if it works when you get it, it will still be working a year later.  The money I saved more than outweighed the 1 year manufacturers warranty.  One last note.... You will probably need it sized to your wrist.  If you purchase from the internet, then just find a local watch repair shop that services higher end watches, they will do it for you.  DO NOT GO TO a Mall Kiosk like Watch Works, etc!!\nWear it and Enjoy it.  You can't take it with you!",

                "review_body": "I got this watch as a gift from my wife earlier this year in June.. Absolutely love it! Being a big James Bond fan, I was glad I finally have this watch! Growing up watching Pierce Brosnan playing Bond, I fell in love with the watch he wore which was similar to this. Beautiful blue bezel and dial. The one worn by Brosnan was the older 2531.80 model. This is a very nice revamp of that model but with the Co-Axial movement and the applied hour markers so it looks much more grandeur than the older one did. An instant classic... And Daniel Craig did wear this same model in Casino Royale!\n\nThe overall looks of the watch is really good and the wave patterns on the dial looks great under the light. The watch feels very well made, not surprising coming from a brand like Omega. The luminosity of the watch is pretty good and can last all night, bright enough to tell the time in the dark. Its neither too heavy nor too light, with a perfect weight that feels good around the wrist without it feeling too heavy. The bracelet, although complex and complicated to resize by yourself, is extremely comfortable and is probably the most comfortable stainless steel bracelet there is out there right now.\n\nIt also has a nice brushed finish with smaller links that are polished. A very nice looking bracelet that looks dressy enough to be worn formally and casually. The clasp however scratches easily. The scratches will appear no matter how well you take care of it and I feel the scratches will add character to the watch.\n\nBeing a watch aficionado, I wear this watch more now than I do my other watches. This is really a beautiful looking watch! Omega is discontinuing this model soon, so grab yours before it is gone. Currently, it is one of the most affordably priced Omega watch out there in the market when compared with the other Omega watches. Highly recommended! Especially if you are a James Bond fan!",

                "review_body": "I own two of these watches; the mechanical one pictured here (in black) and a quartz model in blue.  The watch is, in a word, a work of art.  A couple of things you should know about it, though:\n\n1)  This model has been discontinued, and the replacement model does not have the iconic \"wave dial\" that sets this watch apart.  The new model has a ceramic bezel and the watch face is a glossy blue or black.  I personally think they ruined the watch by getting rid of the wave dial, both because it was beautiful and because it set this watch apart from other dive watches.  I ended up buying mine from the 'secondary market' (i.e., an authorized dealer who was selling out existing stock), but if you want one of these treasures, you should buy it quickly while there are still a few around.\n\n2)  Do not buy the watch from this site.  You can buy this watch from various sources for around $2,700.  Authorized dealers who still have some in stock have been allowed to offer deep discounts given that this model has been discontinued, and at least for now, there's a decent number of pre-owned but mint condition watches out there.\n\nPrice isn't the only reason to avoid this site.  When you buy a watch from Amazon or any other non-authorized dealer, the manufacturer warranty is void and the serial numbers have been scratched off the watches.  That's why you see these items advertised with something other than the manufacturer warranty.  The serial numbers are scratched off to prevent Omega from getting these watches and identifying the original authorized dealer.  The watches are 100% authentic (some people have erroneously said they're fakes), but because they've been sold through this gray market, there is no manufacturer warranty and you will find it considerably more difficult to sell this watch second-hand if you ever want to.",

                "review_body": "This 2006 edition of the famous James Bond watch made its debut in the movie Casino Royale.  Actually, there are two Omega watches in the movie; the limited edition Omega Seamaster Plant Ocean Big Size 2907.50.91 and the limited edition Omega Seamaster Chronometer 2226.80.00.  The watch offered here carries on the James Bond style without the limited edition price tag.\n\nThis style of the James Bond watch first appeared in the movie 'Golden Eye' (1995) and is still available as the full size gents model 2531.80.00.  The new 2006 model 2220.80.00 has several refinements that you should consider over the previous (but still available) model.  Most notably, the automatic movement now has the newly designed Co-Axial escapement.  The Co-Axial Technology reduces sliding friction compared with the lever escapement in the previous model and ensures greater accuracy over time.  More importantly, it doesn't require servicing for 10 years versus 2-3 years in the previous model.  Servicing a luxury watch like Omega can be expensive.  Bear in mind that any Omega watch purchased on the internet voids the International Warranty, so read the seller's warranty terms carefully.  This watch is also available in a quartz version as model 2221.80.00.\n\nThe other big change is the appearance of the watch face.  The blue wave dial is a deeper shade blue with a more distinctive wave pattern and the Seamaster script is a subtle red.  More apparent is the hour markings are now encased in stainless steel mountings instead of painted on as in the previous model.  This alone cleans up the watch face and makes it look like it costs thousands more.\n\nIf you desire a James Bond series watch with a true Swiss movement, this is the one.",

The Seamaster is amazingly beautiful and, set to the atomic clock at Fort Collins, CO, varies by only a couple of seconds a day!\nA Swiss watchmaker with whom I deal has told me that the Omega Co-Axial movement is the finest automatic movement in the world. Judging by the way the Seamaster keeps time, I can't argue with him. You can easily spend twice as much on a Rolex or Bulgari, to name just two brands, but you will not find better build quality or time keeping.\nI couldn't be more pleased with my purchase!",

I had been looking at this watch for over a year on different websites but elected to go with Amazon since they have never let me down in the past 5 years.  They did not disappoint yet again!!!!\n\nI received the watch via UPS and the packaging was neat and complete.  To erase all doubts about the authenticity of the watch, I took it to an OMEGA boutique store and had them inspect he watch.  Although they could not officially \"certified\" the watch, the boutique manager had no doubts the watch I purchased from Amazon was authentic.\n\nI have been wearing the watch for about one month now and I am glad I went with Omega.  The watch keeps its time well as I wear it everyday.  The design fits well with any setting.\n\nI have no regrets purchasing my first high end watch through Amazon!!!",

I was a Bond fan like any red-blooded American boy, and so when I saw this watch featured so prominently in the laser cutting scene on the train in Goldeneye...well, you get the idea.  I ended up buying one much later when I was in high school, but it was a model from the 1980s and I tried to flip it on eBay.  I got it for $450, which I thought was super cheap.  Ended up selling it for $450.\n\nWhen I was applying for real jobs after a stint in the IDF I told myself that as soon as I could, I would buy this watch.  I saved and saved, and the time came.  I ended up first getting the mid-size version off a really good eBay deal.  Well, I am 6'4 and 200 pounds.  So, I'm not a small person really.  The mid-size should be avoided at all costs - it's not the watch you want.\n\nLook, I could write a novel about my Omega that I purchased here on Amazon.  I bought it back in 2012, and it has been a workhorse ever since.  I only take it off to exercise, sleep, and serious manual labor.  I love wearing it when I shoot guns or do manly stuff, just like Bond would do.\n\nThe 2220.80 is amazing, and Amazon gives you a mint, brand new, in box, absolutely legit model.  Pull the trigger, my friend, and join the SMP club.",

The watch fits my wrist well.  I really like the push button style clasp.  I was very apprehensive about buying this watch from Amazon, but decided to give it a try due to all the positive customer feedbacks.  I'm so happy that I did.  I saved a bundle.  The watch arrived the next day - all documentation was there - including the Omega certificate.  I took the watch to my local watch shop and had the bracelet adjusted.  Cost $15.  All in all, I am very happy with this watch and with the Amazon buying experience.\n\nUpdate (Feb. 2010 - It's been over a year now and I still love this watch.  I am very impressed by the accuracy - I'm getting about -1 second per day.  Not bad for an automatic.  After a year of daily wearing in all sorts of situation - swimming in the ocean, doing yard work, computer work, etc - not a single scratch on the crystal.  However, the watch band (bracelet) and bezel are prone to scratches.  I wish the bezel has a coin edge like that of the Rolex'es.  The  scalloped edge is hard to turn.",

                "review_body": "I've owned this watch for about a year now and I've been a bit disappointed.  I purchased it brand new and it already broke/malfunctioned once, as I was winding it.  I didn't wind it too hard or too much but at some point the watch stopped working. I thought I had overwound it--which it's not supposed to be possible with self winding, automatic watches--so I left it to rest for a few days and lo and behold the watch started to work again! However, I've noticed that the crown has a lot more resistance than before plus it recoils a bit when being wound. Yes, Omega makes one heck of a product but I'm disappointed of the 2500 C caliber.  It's basically an ETA-based model. Although heavily modified, the ETA movement that Omega based its 2500 caliber on is only worth about $129 retail! Granted, Omega turns this movement into a COSC-certified chronometer--and I must say a very accurate one (it runs only 4 seconds a day fast, which falls perfectly within the COSC specifications).  Other than the movement though, the quality of the case, dial, hands, and bracelet is unmatched!  I just wish Omega would have matched this model with a slightly higher quality caliber.  All in all, it's a beautiful time piece to look at.  You'll never get tired of looking at it--even when it doesn't work. As I once read on a quote, with this time piece \"time is just an excuse.\"",

                "review_body": "Well, I guess I was supposed to have this watch.  I had always wanted a Seamaster Cronometer Automatic, but never saw myself spending this kind of money, not to mention the price at an authorized dealer.  Amazon sent me an email a week or so ago that had special 12 months no interest on select watches.  I looked and looked and finally pulled the trigger on this fantastic blue face large size automatic.  Actually, I ordered on July 31, 2009 and for $6.99 extra with Amazon Prime had it at my door before 10:00 a.m. this morning.  It's a good thing I took advantage of the offer, because as of today, the \"12 months\" offer is no more and the price has actually gone up!\n\nI had somewhat of a concern by ordering a \"gray market\" watch, but I had ordered a Luminox ETA automatic from Amazon about 4 or 5 years ago and had good luck with it and also saved about $200.00.\n\nI read all of the reviews here on Amazon and even went to watch forums such as [...] and read reviews.  The folks on timezone appear to only purchase through authorized dealers.  Fortunately by going to a forum I learned about some very important things surrounding the watch such as serial numbers and a little \"red dot\" that Omega applies to watches out of the factory.  I had concerns about this and thought that if I saw anything suspicious that I could just return the watch to Amazon.  Man was I happy after inspecting it!  Sure enough, all of the serial numbers were there from the multiple cards that come with the watch to the little \"medallions\" that are tied to the watch upon opening.  The watch itself has the laser engraved serial number in the appropriate place also.  I had heard that some \"gray market\" watches do not come with everything, from what I have seen, my purchase from Amazon did.  I realize that it can only be covered under warranty through Amazon, but by saving hundreds if not close to a \"grand\" that's fine with me.\n\nNow to that little \"red dot\".  Sure enough it is there and it acts as a tiny little \"bridge\" between the case and the screwed on case back.  It tells you if anyone has opened the case since it came from the factory as the little dot will break upon opening the case.  I guess if someone really wanted to take the time they could \"paint\" it back on, but it would be difficult as I'm not sure it's exactly paint.\n\nThis is the new \"007\" watch with the Co-Axial movement in it and it is super quiet!  If I didn't know that it was an auto, I'd think it was a quartz.  You can't feel it moving around either on your wrist.\n\nThe fit and finish of the watch is second to none.  I'm really not sure why Rolex charges as much as they do, the Omega seems like a bargain actually, even though it's still an expensive watch.  So far, as I write this review at 4:31 p.m., it seems to be keeping fine time.  I'll have to wait and see how it is tomorrow.  When I received my Luminox I had to take it and have it calibrated as it was way too fast upon arrival, it keeps perfect time now.  I'm hoping that this Omega Chronometer will not need adjusting.  You'd think since it is a \"certified chronometer\" that you would not need it, but I've read of several people having to have theirs adjusted, even folks that bought from authorized dealers.\n\nI can see why this model is so popular, it's just a really fine time piece.  Those luminous hands and hour markers as just as stated, they glow bright and for a long time!\n\nI know that some say that they would NEVER buy \"gray market\", but I've always had excellent service with Amazon and since I had no issues with my first watch from them, I'm sure glad I took advantage of their offer and purchased this fine time piece!  All in all, for the savings it was worth it and I'll continue to purchase my time pieces from Amazon.\n\nHope this review helps anyone with reservations about purchasing an expensive time piece from Amazon.\n\nTake care\n\nUPDATE: December 13, 2009\n\nMerry Christmas all.  Just wanted to give a short update on my SMP 300.  As You can see, I purchased this watch back in August.  This has to be one of the finest watches that I have ever purchased hands down!  It keeps perfect time.  I can set it to an atomic clock and it will still be within 1 second 72hrs later.  Amazing.  Again, by purchasing mine through Amazon, it came with all of the cards, boxes, matching serial numbers, red dot on caseback in tact, everything!\n\nSeasons Greetings!\n\nUPDATE 10/24/2010 - This still has got to be one of THE best purchases I have ever made!  This watch is just truly fantastic.  I have had zero problems with it and it just keeps fantastic time.  It's amazing that a mechanical watch can keep this good of time.  The watch is just plain solid and wears extremely well.  I wear this thing everyday to work and to work out in the yard in and it still looks brand new.  If you've been contemplating this watch and Amazon is offering it directly, then you will not be sorry if you purchase it.  I stress though, I would only feel comfortable purchasing it though if Amazon were the merchant and not a 3rd party.  I realize that there are fine and honest 3rd party vendors, but with Amazon, you know that they will take care of you.  It also comes with all cards, papers and such from Amazon.  I love this watch!\n\nUPDATE: 12 Years Later - August 2022\nWatch is still just as perfect as the day I received it.  Have never had to have it serviced and keeps extremely good time.\n\nIt\u2019s a shame that some people have had problems, in addition to receiving a used watch, it appears.  I made certain to buy mine directly from Amazon as the vendor rather than a 3rd party.  Not that it would have mattered; I don\u2019t know.\n\nIt\u2019s still a fantastic watch that I bought for $2150 here on Amazon.",

To good to be true.\n\nRecieved watch which was is a more modern Omega box which was the first warning sign.  With no warranty card, manual, or papers.  I took to an Omega dealer who authenticated the watch for me to find that it was real and was +10 sec a day (in need for service ($600)).  Watch came with a scratched bezel and polishing wheel marks and rounded edges on the braclet (as a sign of a poor polishing job).  Furthermoe, the 12'oclock marker on the bezel did not match up with 12 o'clock marker on the dial.  These idicators clearly established that the watch was in fact USED and not in new/unworn condition.  Bracelet was missing numerous sizing links which would have required approx $200 - $300 in additional cost just to be able to wear it.  I returned the watch for a full refund with very responsive customer service.\n\nFound same watch on ebay in better condition with all sizing links for 25% less.  Would not buy from this vendor again.  Buy with caution, to good to be true.\n\nPhoto's are off watch imperfections and fake warranty card wallet compared to a real one in an Omega boutique.",

The watch itself is pretty comfortable, but it took me a day or so to get used to. I have the blue version. It has a butterfly clasp for the bracelet. I like the finer details of the watch as well, like the fact that the second hand has a subtle red tip. This watch is a fun watch, it's not small, but as you can see from my photos, it's not huge either. I have a very small wrist, so if you have even a normal-sized wrist, it should wear a little smaller. Great watch and I've had no issues so far. Did not buy through Amazon.",

This is the most expensive thing I have ever bought online so naturally I was nervous, but the good news is that you literally can't go wrong with Amazon. With the steep discount, zero taxes, and free two day shipping, I'm left feeling stupid for paying full msrp in the past on my other Rados in brick and mortar stores. And rest assured, this is 100% real, validated by the local watch technician.\n\nI chose this particular model because it has a cleaner look than the models with the two additional timers and buttons on the side. When worn, the solid black looks sharp and contemporary , so this may not be a \"shorts and t-shirt\" kind of watch. Also, one thing I didn't realize is that the links get substantially narrow on the inside which causes the R5.5 to feel more delicate than some other watches, but then again I only wear it to dressier occasions so it's not really an issue. Overall I couldn't be happier with the look and the value I received purchasing this new Rado. I will definitely consider buying from Amazon again.",

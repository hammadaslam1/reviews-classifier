When I called Tech support, I was informed that it was not campatible with my operating system. When I pointed out I was using Win 98se on a Compaq comupter they tried to help. I was able to finally get it installed after being on the phone with Tech Support for almost 2 hours. It worked for one day then quit printing. When I again called Tech Support and spent another hour on the phone the printer finally started working but the Scanner quit. As I was buying a second computer with Win XP I asked if it would be compatible and was assured that it was.\nWhen I was ready to install the A1500 on the new computer, I called Tech Support and they taslked me through the whole process. Not only would it not install it crashed my system and I had to do a full restore.\nAs I waited to long to return it, it is now seating on a shelf collecting dust until I can find someone who will take it off my hands. In the mean time I`m still looking for a good multifunction that will work as advertised.\nI would not recommend the A1500 to anyone who does not have money and time to waste.",

Overall, it was a decent machine before it began to die.\n\nIt takes two ink cartridges, Lexmark black-12A1970 ($25-$32) and Lexmark color-12A1985 ($29-$39).  The ink seemed to last for a good while.  However, if you don't use the cartridges in a while, the ink will dry up (this is what happened to my color cartridge a few times).\n\nWhen I first purchased it, I thought the design was great, but as I needed copies and scans of different items, I changed my mind.  The copier/scanner is operated via a feeder instead of being a flatbed.  I couldn't scan a page from a book or magazine (unless I wanted to rip out the page and feed it to the machine).  It was also somewhat difficult to make copies of smaller items such as cards, IDs or pictures, even with the protective sleeve that is included with this model.\n\nBefore Compaq was bought out by HP, there was Compaq Customer Communities where consumers could post questions and give answers to one another (I had an alignment problem with this unit that was easily solved by a visit to Customer Communities).  Unfortunately, HP removed the community.  I guess it's a good thing I got the 3 year warranty from Circuit City.  After about a year and a half, the scanner and copier started to act up.  I would no longer get clean scans/copies, and it would use two 8.5\" x 11\"\" pages to copy a single document with the same dimensions.  Customer Service couldn't help with the problem",

I ended up getting the F80Q-X2AM because it's bigger than a netbook but it's not really big. The 14.1 inch screen and full sized keyboard are just what I was looking for. This laptop has everything you could want: DVD player, webcam, big hard drive, lots of RAM, memory card reader, wireless network card, bluetooth, decent carrying case.  Good stuff. On top of that, the 2-year warranty, accidental damage protection, and spill-proof keyboard are really nice, especially for a laptop going to a young kid.\n\nThe only thing I don't like about this laptop is the operating system. Windows Vista is for the birds, and I'm not just saying that. I've had bad experiences with Vista in the past, so I'm biased negatively with respect to Vista. On the other hand, I used to work at Microsoft and I like the company a lot. But when it takes 3 hours to get connected to a wireless network, you know you're using a crummy operating sytem. Specifically, I encountered the infamous \"unidentified network\"\" problem which millions of others have likely experienced over the last couple of years with Vista.

Asus is now the only computer/technology products I purchase.\n\nPurchased the notebook in August 2009 to replace the brand-new hunk of HP junk that's broke a week after I bought it but HP refused to repair it b/c it got wet in shipping and I didn't buy insurance. No need to worry, I jury-rigged it and sold it at a $50.00 profit to a poor consumer that hasn't yet learned to either look online for product reviews or understand that the only good HP product is the one you don't own. I know, another story for another time....\n\nAnyway, I'm trying to be a better consumer and that means being a better product reviewer. I'm not going to go to a lot of effort or detail here but I do want to \"catch-up\"\" my product reviews. So",

I have never had so much trouble with a computer. The operating system constantly gets corrupted. The computer freezes frequently resulting in a hard restarts which further corrupts the system. Sent it in to be looked at by Asus after informing them that I had reinstalled the operating system 5 times and thought either the motherboard or memory was bad. Also told them one of the USB ports was defective. All they did was reinstall the operating system. I had already done that 5 times in a matter of 3 weeks. They did not even test the hardware.\n\nThe display is not very good. Very bad viewing angles. Blacks are not black, but grey. Buttons are hard to click. Fingerprint device does not load when booting. The video card is very good, too bad the rest of the system is not well designed and components faulty. I may have to get with my credit card company on this one as Asus doesn't seem very interested in repairing it and I am ready to throw it in the garbage. Sony and Macintosh products are much superior, but don't offer such a great video card.\n\nOverall, I would not recommend this notebook to anyone, unless you enjoy frustration. I have owned over 10 notebooks over the last 15 years or so, and this is the worst of the bunch. Stay away, look at Sony, Dell or Apple instead.\n\nAdded March 2010: Bought a Sony Vaio CW. Great computer. Now I can ditch this Asus N81 crap. No system corruption no matter what I install. This is how a computer should run. There has got to be an incompatibility with Windows and Asus software. Lesson learned: buy Apple or Sony.",

Asus warranty seems to be great, we will see in the future if/when I need it. HDMI is nice, even though after upgrading to Windows 7 Ultimate I had some problems to make it show properly on my HDTV (32 Inch Samsung Full HD). Overall, a 9/10 for this kind of product.

Didn't get Dell studio 14z (price, too much heat, no dvd), sony vaio CW (price), HP DV4t (price if configured the same), DELL StudioXPS 13 (price, heat issues, battery duration,small touchpad)\nhave had it for 5 days so far ... Got it for [850$ from amazon] (could have gotten it for [...] if I used bing cashback and [...] )\nPros:\n-Very powerful.. CPU , GPU , HDD (7200rpm).. it got 5.9 on windows experience index because of the HDD, the CPU/RAM gets 6.4 & GPU gets 6.6 .that's with win 7 64bit, it got as far as I remember ; 5.4 or 5.9 on the CPU with vista 32bit that came with it..\n-Sooo cheap for such power\n-Looks nice; not super nice, but nice..\n-Very well ventilation design .. for all that power, it doesn't get hot.\n-included mouse (not wireless) and bag...\n-full array of ports ( including FIVE usb ports, that is amazing )\nCons:\nwhen you have so much power, the input devices should be up to the same standard; they are not\n-No backlit keyboard.. I know; I knew this before buying it; but when you get it and can't see the f1/f12 keys in the dark and can't see the WIFI / Bluetooth either ; not even the power button if it is not turned on ...\n\n-FN key on left of CTRL key ... VERY VERY Stupid .. I already knew, but thought I can adapt; not yet..\n-Horrible sounding and functioning touchpad buttons .. needs too much power to press and makes too much noise .. I already knew thru reviews but didn't appreciate how bad they are .. I honestly try to avoid using them ..\n-Now the worst part; the left side of the keyboard is so flimsy that when pressing any of those keys (ESC,`,1,2,TAB,Q,W,A,S,CAPS,LT SHIFT, Z,LT CTRL,FN) it makes so much noise ... you won't appreciate how frustrating or annoying this is until you use it ... Same about trying to avoid using them, except u can't\n-The DVD tray button is very difficult to press without directly looking at it ...\n- the scrolling bar on the touchpad is a hit/miss, you have to press the line drawn on the touchpad exactly for it to work , and it keeps scrolling even after u remove your finger, u have to press it again like u r applying a brake .. STUPID DESIGN ..\n- unresponsive keys: sometimes some keys don't respond to pressing them leading to too many typing errors ..\n- poooor battery life, though it is understandable, but at least ASUS should offer a 9 cell option ...\nupdate 12/29/09:\n- f3,f4,f9 keys don't have labels for their other function ( default mail application, default browser, turn on/off touchpad in order)",

Inspiron was just too big for all that down time.\n\nBottom line is this has been a great laptop with no issues (well there was one and the online tech. support promptly resolved it and it was a result of my error).\n\nThe only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because of the case, just too darn much plastic for me.  Although the carbon fiber look to it is pretty cool looking!\n\nI researched for a couple of months at the time and decided this was the one for me with most all of the bells & whistles I was looking for and as others have stated [...], that put it over the top for me.",

It's got plenty of space and easily handles the programs I usually run at the same time--Explorer, OneNote, Outlook, Photoshop/Illustrator, Media Player. Six months later, it's still running well with no problems and I'm continually glad I made the purchase.\n\nI also do some casual gaming with it, thanks to the Nvidia graphics card. Games like Dragon Age push it to it's limits, but it can still handle newer games. It has no trouble with anything older than that (unless there are compatibility issues between the game and Windows 7.\n\nI plan on using this laptop as I return to graduate school and feel like it's size, weight, and speed will work well for me to use it mainly for work, and a bit of entertainment on the side.\n\nMy chief complaints, which keep me from giving it 5 stars, are that it doesn't have separate media buttons for changing the volume (though this can be done by holding the function key and hitting F11 or F12), it's lack of various video output ports, and that the speakers distort when turned up all the way. Maybe it's not the best choice for one looking for a machine dedicated primarily to entertainment, but that doesn't mean you can't enjoy some light gaming or movies with it.",

I have purchased mostly Dell products over the years, but their web site has gotten difficult to deal with that I decided to look elsewhere.  I figured that I would go for this laptop and would return it if it was not up to standard.\n\nIt is great, great price point, good looking sharp design, good keyboard.  You have to strip of a lot of the junk that they put on but that is the same with all machines.\n\nAfter three months, it is working properly, no issues to date.  Would buy again.",

I did a LOT of research before choosing the ASUS K50IJ-D2 15.6-Inch model, and for the price I can easily say that it was well worth it. I find this laptop a good size for me. If you are looking for a super-thin and ultra-light laptop like a Macbook Air, this isn't the product for you. If you're looking for a dependable and quality laptop for usage mainly within the home, it will probably be a good fit.\n\nMy one main issue with this laptop is the sound - loudness and quality is terrible! If you plan on watching videos or playing music, you will need an external sound system to bump up the volume (or headphones).\n\nAlso good to know about is the internal microphone - I didn't realize that there was one (and that I wouldn't need to set anything up for it), and it sure came in handy when I installed my Rosetta Stone programs and was able to do the pronunciation parts just by talking in a regular voice - microphone really picks up the sound.",

Long story short, it wasn't until *May* that I finally got a working computer.\n\nIt took several hours of followup to get them to do something about it. And to boot, Asus made me pay shipping costs--both on shipping the battery back when they thought that was the problem, then on shipping the computer back when they realized that it was the computer itself that was faulty.\n\nI will never be purchasing an Asus product again. I've never experienced worse customer service in my life--not even from utility companies.",

It's fast, it seems to handle multi-tasking without any issues.  The facial recognition software works well and I'm the kinda guy to use it seeing as I'm also the kinda guy to make rediculously difficult passwords lol.  In all the time I've had this computer I've only one problem with it...  It doesn't seem to do well with watching movies...  It glitches and stutters a lot.  Now if you rip the movie to the harddrive, then you're good to go, it'll play flawlessly.  It's only when you're watching it from the disk.  I've not tried using the blu-ray, not something I'm too interested in.  Overall I love this computer and I hope that any who get it, get as much enjoyment outta it as I have.  :-)",

Turned it on when I first received it and let the ASUS ran the initial setup (that took a while).  Then, off Windows 7 and on Ubuntu 9.10 (64bit).  Everything is working fine except the webcam is upside down (one star off) so I needed to place a patch to reverse the image back to right side up.  Also got the Logitech VX Nano cordless mouse to pair it with this laptop.\n\nIf you're looking for a nice laptop and don't care much if it doesn't come with an nVidia graphic card, then this is a nice laptop.  Fast and bright.  Will receive a long HDMI cable (also from amazon) in the next few days to connect it to my tv.  Don't think that would be a problem to get it to work.\n\nNow, I just need to get a wireless printer (to replace the old HP 712C) so I can print from this laptop anywhere in the house.",

That is the primary problem with other related problems also occurring.  Asus most recently sent me a refurbished laptop that I'm assuming someone else returned to the factory for the same problems.

I love it!\nPros: Huge screen that is not distorted. Super fast processor, awesome warranty, great features(HDMI that I connect to my bedroom tv)...\nCons: Windows 7 - if you have older software that you want to install good luck. It may or may not work.\nI was able to install MS Office 2003 with Outlook. I had trouble installing Outlook 2003 but eventually got it to work. Printer had problems too but I installed the Vista update and then 7 and it worked. Same with my MP3 player.\nWindows 7 started out as not my favorite windows but it is growing on me.\n\nWould highly recommend this laptop!",

                "review_body": "For the price I think this laptop is pretty decent.  You get all the bells and whistles you could possibly want for only a hundred dollars more than the older model without a blue-ray player, not as good graphics card, less memory, etc.\n\nMy only complaint is with the touchpad, although this complaint can cause some headaches.  First off the location and style of the touch pad is pretty bad.  Because it isn't a different color from the rest of the case and the indentation is not very deep, its really easy to not truely know your on it unless you actively concentrate on where your finger is, so it's a lot less natural than other touch pads.  Secondly the location is horrible.  When I type with the keyboard i fairly often bump the touchpad with my left-hand palm, which causes the mouse to click occasionally.  If I'm in a word processor or web browser this can be extremely aggravating as I can change web pages or where I am typing if the cursor is at those areas.\n\nThirdly, either the software or the sensor is not the greatest.  About 10% of the time my clicks don't register or moving across the screen registers as a click.  I'm hoping once i get time to find any updated drivers for the touchpad (whose website I tried but wasn't working when I looked this weekend) will fix this, otherwise it's gonna be a long 4 years before I get a new computer.\n\nUPDATE:  After a little over a year old, this laptop's graphics card started failing, and this caused a month+ long odyssy to get it fixed by ASUS under warrenty.  Because of this debacle, I will never by an ASUS product again. Read more below.\n\nThis experience report isn't about this exact model, but a similar one for which I have had a terrible experience with ASUS technical support, and so potential buyers of any ASUS computer should be well-aware in order to know what their experience might be. The summary is for a simple bad graphics card (under warranty), getting the computer back in working condition involved a 5-week ordeal, 6 emails to them, 5 phone calls, misleading information almost making me pay for repairs, and them wiping my hard drive in my opinion unnecessarily. All this means I will never buy an ASUS laptop again, and you shouldn't either. For the details, read on.\n\nAbout 7 months ago, I started noticing a flicker of the laptop's screen about 1 time a day. I emailed ASUS tech support using their message center about it, and asked what I should do. Aside from an automated \"we have your message\"\" email",

It was one of the few really small, affordable laptop computers that runs Win 7 Professional, which I need for access to my employer's network.  It's no speed demon, and the hard drive is a bit smaller than I would like, but it works.  What I discovered is that the computer works well enough that I use it at home more than I expected.  If I want to browse the web or do email or do simple picture editing I can carry the ASUS into a quiet part of the house and work in peace.\nThe build quality is good, though this is not an industrial strength device that will take a huge beating.  I don't know if the keyboard would hold up to long hours of daily use.  This notebook PC probably won't take the place of your desktop but it works well.  Mine has been reliable so far.  The only real complaints so far:  The short/wide screen is not ideal for viewing some web pages, and the small screen yields fairly small text size on many pages.\nDespite those minor issues, it is nearly perfect for what I wanted.",

The only problem I had was one that not many people will run into: I needed to hook an extra large monitor to the external VGA port.  I did so, and it would not recognize the PNP monitor as a PNP monitor, but instead labeled it as NON-PNP Generic.  This limits the resolutions available to the monitor.  I tried several different monitors (normal sized and large, and they all had the same result.  None of them registered as plug and play.\nI contacted ASUS, as this was clearly an OS or Hardware issue, both of which would fall under their abilities to fix.  They told me that the large monitor was outside what the driver supported.  This was clearly incorrect as the issue had nothing to do with the size of the monitor (as proven by using smaller monitors).  The first tech used every excuse he could think of not to work on the system including saying that the support of this laptop's hardware was not their problem.  At this point I asked that the problem be escalated or that I could talk to his manager.  He would do neither, but suggested that I call back and talk to someone else.  I did.\nThe next tech looked over the notes left by the other tech and said that he was not able to escalate the call either as the criteria did not match the requirements for escalations in their system.  A little more honest.  He did say, however, that if I sent the laptop back to them that they would take a look at this and get it resolved.  I needed the laptop for that weekend, but at least he finally supplied me a path to resolution.  The second tech was more pleasant, and slightly more helpful, but generally felt like he had his hands tied.\nThe ASUS support was not what I have come to expect from professional support from other vendors.\nTheir product might be great, but I would not recommend their product due their support.",

I chose this particular model based on word of mouth and written reviews. Of particular importance to me were battery life, processor speed, wireless n, and quality of construction (particularly the keyboard). I have been very pleased so far. I can charge the computer at night and get a full day out of it with what I consider average-frequent use.\n\nInitially, I was very hesitant about Windows 7 Starter. I know people have mixed feelings about it, but I really like it. I have yet to encounter the 3 program limit some reviewers have cited. I also want to note that Asus includes their own software that allows customization of the background wallpaper despite the fact that Windows 7 Starter doesn't allow that on its own.\n\nI like the pink and white design. I know that this is a computer and NOT an accessory, but given the choice of color, I enjoyed choosing something unique and fun. The white is very nice and the pink is just subtle enough. This particular one also has a finish that appears to be more resistant to fingerprints than some of the other colors, for what it's worth.\n\nI purchased this netbook because my husband and my best friend both have Asus netbooks and love them. I originally purchased a different but newer Asus model at a different vendor and ultimately returned it because the keyboard felt extremely cheap. Although I wasn't thrilled with that model, I think Asus makes great products and I decided I wanted to stay with this brand--I am so glad I did! Whether you decide on this one or not, I would encourage netbook buyers to look at the many different netbooks Asus offers.",

There are netbooks that out of the box will cost you $700 to $900, but you selected a product in the high $200 to low $300 range. And for that price this is one very nice netbook. The Atom N280 is a couple of generations old now, but very adequate. Just like any computer when you buy on the cheap you will find the performance isn't up to expectations of the higher priced system you didn't want to pay for. How many of us hated the speed of our desktop or laptop until we upgraded the RAM, and then Wow it was great. So if you want faster and more features, well go spend more for those features and find the notebook that matches up. On this system I went to 2 GB of RAM and upgraded to Windows 7 Home Premium, since I had several Win7 upgrades that were offered last year at $49 here on Amazon. I have Office 2007 and a lot of other software that is also on my Laptop and desktop and it all works great. I sync all my files on all my systems so the software is mirrored on the notebook just like the other systems. I also have a newer HP 210-1090NR with an Atom N450 1.66. The HP has 1 GB of RAM and cannot be upgraded to 2 GB no matter what operating system you have.  Side by side this 1005HA-MU17 and the HP are equally as fast when I run identical tasks or programs at the same time on both.  The HP cost me $180 more than the 1005HA-MU17. So faster processor but less memory is equal to slower processor more memory. So bottom line if you bought a Corolla and you complain it doesn't have the features of the Avalon, who's to blame?",

At the end, I'm left with a $330 paperweight, formerly my Eee PC Seashell 1005HA netbook.\n\nI bought it from Amazon on August 13 2009 and used it for four months, until December 30, when the power adapter failed, leaving me with no way to charge the device or receive power from the line cord.  I called Asus tech support, and, following their advice, brought it back to life by plugging and unplugging the brick from the line several times.  Yesterday, March 1 2010, the adapter stopped working again, but I couldn't resuscitate it this time.  When I called Asus tech support, they had no other solution and, incredibly, told me that since the six-month warranty had expired 15 days before, no further service could be provided.  This was insulting on two counts: most reputable manufacturers honor their warranties for a reasonable extended grace period and, in any case, it was a recurrence of a problem that I had first reported well within the warranty period.  I could only believe that the representative was unfamiliar with company policies for such a situation, so I asked her to pass me up to her supervisor.  Same refusal.  I asked for the next-level supervisor.  Same refusal, except that this supervisor agreed to convey my case to yet another office, with no promise of any reply.\n\nI see today that Amazon sells the appropriate adapter for $16.50.  I'm incredulous that for this petty price Asus is willing to sacrifice a previously happy customer and endure the word-of-mouth consequences.  Color me really mad, and without a functioning PC for my travel.",

I originally purchased the device for its size and portability, but found that it didn't really have the horsepower to keep up with Windows 7 (Starter Edition). After several months, I chose to upgrade the system RAM from 1GB to 2GB, which definitely helped, but it was still pretty laggy, especially when surfing the web. After several years of so-so performance I installed Linux Mint 17 (now 18) on the machine and boy what a difference that made. The netbook went from being a machine that I kept in the bag most of the time to becoming my daily driver. The sluggish, laggy performance with Windows 7 was replaced with snappy, responsive performance that, in conjunction with the small form factor, made the netbook an ideal on-the-go device. I can safely say 9 years after my original purchase that the machine is significantly faster today running Linux Mint than it was when brand new running Windows 7 Starter. My wife and I own a multi-million dollar IT services company, and this netbook has been serving as my primary business \"laptop\"\" for the past 5 years. At this juncture I wouldn't trade my old netbook for a brand new device... its become like an old trusted friend.\"",

The wide touchpad has the right level of sensitivity as well. And Windows 7, even with the entry level Starter edition, offers much faster processing & bootup times than Windows XP does on the Intel Atom N270 processor.\n\nHowever, the Asus Eee 1005HA has its achilles heel in mechanical design.  The 250GB HDD has undamped vibrations that pass throughout the chassis and straight into your wrists.  The fan also runs excessively.  The combination creates high levels of noise and vibration compared to similar netbooks such as the Acer Aspire One D250.  Also, even without Anti-Virus software running, Windows 7 and the preloaded software consume 40% of the available 1GB of memory.\n\nAsus will undoubtedly be working out the kinks in this netbook, but many users will find the vibration and noise levels to be unacceptable, especially when other manufacturers offer netbooks without these concerns.  Once Asus releases a thermally cool, vibrationless version with 2GB DDR2 memory, this netbook will be unstoppable.\n\nUpdate:  after exchanging for a second 1005HA, it has the exact same vibration issues.  This endemic rather than a one-off dud.",

As a matter of fact, out of all the computers I've owned or used in my life, I find this one the easiest to type on with the best accuracy. It's a great computer for internet and word processing. I would recommend it to anyone!",

However now a days pretty much everything can be downloaded.I love the system sounds in windows 7, they are short and not noisy like other operating systems. I wish this particular model had bluetooth, but an adapter can be bought separately.I think that other ASUS EEE models have it, not sure though. I also hate that it doesn't have a button specifically to mute sound, you have to use the Fn key combination to mute the sound. Besides those two issues, I would recommend it. I will buy another one for my sister. Hope this helps =D",

I did purchase a 2GB stick of RAM for it, which I would recommend, as well as a small carrying case to keep things neat.  It has worked flawlessly to date.  I remember reading someone's review indicating that it seemed to get overly warm with operation; I have not found that to be the case.  Asus indicates the battery should run for 8.5 hours between charges, but I suspect under normal operation that might be a bit overly-optimistic.  That being said, the battery does last quite a while before a re-charge is needed, and I like the fact that I can replace the battery myself if needed.  It also runs very quietly and that's a plus.  I'm running most of my desktop apps on this machine as well and have had no issues.  I would highly recommend this netbook for consideration.",

The person on the other end (not of this country) was rude, unhelpful and just plain a sarcastic female dog.  She walked me through everything I did before calling her and was speaking down to me like I was a child, even after I explained to her that I did everything she is telling me.  Finally after 45 minutes of her crap, she told me I would have to send the computer in so that they can fix the computer because I must be doing something wrong.  I sent the computer back to Asus, had to pay for my s/h and then finally got the computer back 15 days from when I sent it.\nNeedless to say, I am selling this peice of junk and will NEVER do businss with Asus again.  Even though they have one of the longest warranties in the industry, it does help if you have a jerk on the other end.\nCome to find out....you SHOULD NOT upgrade the Windows Starter on the netbooks because it uses too much memory for the chip and you should not install Office 7 either.

Reported battery life - not quite the stated 8.5 hours, but still excellent at about 6.\n\nThe Good: Nice HD capacity (250GB).  Good screen (esp. if u use Chrome).  Enough guts to use OO.o.  Works well with Win XP.  One-button touchpad on/off NICE!!!  Full-sized right SHIFT key (with reconfigured arrow keys) NICE!!! ASUS software package is good.\n\nThe Verdict: I bought this netbook as a replacement for my other ASUS netbook (1001 I think) with a 40GB SSD.  I loved the earlier netbook but the storage capacity wasn't enough. When I installed CPU intensive applications (e.g. 120 years of National Geographic on DVD run from the HD) the CPU found itself in the Everglades.  However, this netbook is everything I need in a lightweight computer with good storage capacity, connectivity, office suite compatibility and speed, screen size, keyboard layout, portability, and overall ease of use.  THIS NETBOOK IS NOT A REPLACEMENT FOR A DESKTOP COMPUTER OR A MUSCULAR LAPTOP.\n\nThus, if you have a copy of XP handy or are Linux competent and have a pair of headphones handy, this IS your lightweight machine.\n\nP.S.  I believe I've had this netbook for about a year or so and have definitely put it through some paces.\n\n2/17/2018 - I still use this hunk of cheese as a portable Internet surfer and as a storage device because it is still faster than the cloud.  It still chugs along as well as the day I got it.  ;)",

The mousepad works really well, better than some of the other ones I've seen on netbooks. I read in one of the other reviews about the vibrating and noise this computer makes, and I haven't had an issue with that at all.\n\nThere are a couple things I've noticed to be a hassle on the computer though. The mousepad buttons are sometimes hard to use, though once you get used to it they aren't so bad. When certain programs pop up, like quick info on a product from a website or iTunes, sometimes the screen can't fit it all and there is no way to scroll through. I guess a lot of programs are just made for computers with a larger screen. Windows 7 starter has a lot of limitations, but that's to be expected.\n\nOverall this is a great netbook, especially for students or people looking to surf the web and write.

I also have an Asus 1000HE.  This is a bit smaller and lighter.\n\nI give it a 4, rather than a 5, for a few reasons, most of which have been stated in other reviews.  It's a fingerprint magnet.  The jack for the power cord seems very fragile.  The touchpad, and its single bar, rather than a right and left click button, is a nuisance. In Linux at least, I can't use two finger scrolling.  The touchpad is bumpy and there's a smooth area to the right that will work for one finger scrolling.  Note that this is in Linux, I don't know how it works in Windows.\n\nOther than that, it's a netbook.  It's small, not that powerful, but fine for browsing, reading ebooks, skype (though probably better with headphones), documents and the like.\n\nIt's pretty similar to the 1000HE, with the upside of less size and weight, plus a better keyboard (full size right hand shift key this time), but with a flimsier connector from power cord to computer and that touch pad.\n\nI remember years ago, the Gateway Arc 200 (an ultralight--but not a netbook, it was rather expensive at the time) had the middle mouse button as a little wheel on a bar above the touchpad.  I've never seen it since, but for me, at least, it was the most convenient trackpad equivalent of a mouse button that I've used.",

I've been generally happy with the performance of the machine, the battery life and its ability to display downloaded movies from Amazon Unbox.  My big issue is that I have had intermittent charging problems.  I can't tell if the problem is the adapter or the system board. The adapter gets very hot at the tip, and the laptop gets very hot in the area where the adapter connects.  I'm talking burn your finger hot.  And sometimes the AC adapter just won't charge the thing at all.  Keep trying, a few days later it will mysteriously work.  So I called Asus technical support and went through the troubleshooting with them.  All their suggestions didn't do anything; then while the analyst had me on hold to get an RMA number, it started to work again.  Very, very strange problem.  Anyways, the netbook is on its way back to Asus (at MY expense).  I hope they can resolve the problem as I love traveling with a netbook.  I have read many reviews which leads me to believe mine is NOT an isolated incident.\n\nI also have an Acer Aspire One netbook that I had bought for my mom.  It works just fine and the way the adapter plugs in seems to be better than the Asus.  I like the netbook solution, especially for traveling light on a plane or in the car.\n\nEdit - 4/20/2010 - My Asus was returned to me yesterday and it appears the system board was replaced.  Everything seems to be working much better and I am happy at the moment.  Also, I have compared the Asus display to the Acer display and the Asus is much brighter and easier to view.  Those of you with charging problems - I recommend sending the unit back to Asus and recommend they change the system board.",

                "review_body": "Unfortunately, I bought this netbook as an impulse buy (the husband's computer died, and he took over my Mac Mini). Therefore, I didn't do as much research as I should have. Overall, it's a nice little machine for its price. The things you need to look out for are:\n\n1. Operating System - this machine has Windows 7 Starter, which is pretty much Microsoft's concilliatory gesture to the manufacturers to keep their costs down. How? By getting rid of features and passing the cost down to us.\n\n2. Display - the highest resolution you can get is 1024x600. Rumor has it you can tweak it to a higher resolution. However, if you're not comfortable with playing with drivers, the shorter display size might annoy you. Many programs and sites, like Yahoo! Mail, require 1024x768 for optimum performance.\n\n3. Bluetooth - I thought this model had it, but I see no sign of it. There are different sub-models to the 1005HA, so double-check!\n\n4. Single trackpad button - a bit annoying, if you're not used to it. I get around it by sacrificing one of my USB slots for a mouse.\n\nOther than those annoyances, I am impressed with this little machine. Upgrading to 2GB of RAM makes it even smoother. For those of you unfamiliar with changing memory, there are YouTube videos that demonstrate the process. The keyboard is also nice and large, for a netbook.\n\nIn short, this is a decent machine for its price and for light use.\n\nUPDATE: 2/2/10:\nBy Jan 28, I had figured out how to get pseudo 1240x780 resolution (it involves downloading Windows XP VGA drivers from ASUS and choosing the options to run them with XP compatibility). I took it for its first outside run on Jan 29. It lasted a good 3-4 hours, with only 1/2 the battery power used. However, once I got it home, the display would not show. My husband and I disconnected and reconnected the battery. The display cam up, but with a bunch of vertical lines. I am in the midst of exchanging with Amazon, and I hope the replacement machine does not do the same as the original.",

But for anyone that wants to use this computer as a computer (and not an appliance), then an upgrade is highly recommended.  It's $80 to upgrade to Windows Home Premium.  Maybe cheaper if you are a shady person.  Ubuntu is free, and works perfect on this netbook as is (even when running off of an SD card).\n\nBut since I'm using Windows 7 Ultimate on mine, that is what my review will be based around.  First off, after having this netbook for awhile now, I see no reason to upgrade the RAM.  If you want to upgrade to",

                "review_body": "I am writing this review because I was agonizing over buying this and I couldn't find any reviews on it, which usually is not a good thing. It's been about two weeks of heavy use and I plan on updating this as time goes on. First, I searched for about two months and considered  every conceivable configuration of laptop trying to find what I wanted. I concluded I wanted a light 12.1 inch laptop with an optical drive that had decent speed and battery life. I was fairly certain that configuration didn't exist and was about to buy the ul30 without the optical drive, when I stumbled on this bad boy.\n\nPros:\n\nSIZE!! I really think this is the perfect size form factor for anyone who has to carry a computer on a daily basis; not so thin I am afraid I will snap it in half but not so think and heavy I break my arm carrying it to work (my old laptop was 6 lbs and this one is 4, soooo much better). It's about the size of two or three magazines stacked on top of each other. It slips right in my briefcase and I hardly notice it.  The screen size is actually more than big enough, I absolutely love the size of this thing.\n\nASUS backing their product - ASUS offers a free 2 full years of warranty on this product plus a free year of accidental damage coverage. To buy this for an apple costs $200 at least. I know they're good for it because they offered to fix my computer when I had an issue (see support)\n\nLight up keyboard - this wasn't even on my radar but now that I have it it's probably my favorite feature. It just looks good. I can type with ease at night while I'm watching TV or any dim light situation. You might think you wouldn't use it but I was surprised by how convenient it is. Also, when it's bright it automatically shuts itself off to save battery. I read a lot about this \"keyboard flex\"\" issue.  I now see what people were talking about. There is a liner/spacer cutout which lays between the keys",

It is so new, that not everyone is selling it. I tried to find out more about it, but was out of luck, maybe because it was so new. I decided to buy this laptop because it's size was perfect for me, I travel a lot and I needed something that I could easily carry.\nI am impressed with this computer. I've owned Sonys,Hps. and none can compare to this one.\nIf you are looking for something this size and with all the bells and whistles out there, then this is the best you can buy. You won't regret it.",

                "review_body": "This laptop is slick.  I purchased this to replace a failing four year old Macbook.  With a battery life of around eleven hours in a low power mode, the laptop is ultra-portable.  Kicking into a higher performance mode takes a few seconds and leaves you with a little under half of the maximum battery life.  The touchpad is a bit unconventional and I'm still getting used to it.  It is completely level with the surface of the laptop and I have found my fingers like to wander off the edges of the usable area.  The instant-on splashtop was a nice surprise.  I wasn't even aware of the functionality when I purchased the computer.  The applications are very basic and the music player rates pretty low on the intuitive features list but it does play music after you have your playlists set up.  Though it is fairly big, it's just as thin and lightweight. I don't plan to do any serious gaming on the computer, but I do play EVE.  It ran quite well with the G210M on.  I have only had this product for about a day but so far I'm very happy with it.",

The only problem I have with it is with the keyboard.  Maybe I'll get used to it, but I find it's a bit hard to touch type because you really have to press hard on the keys.  Also, the touch pad is large & positioned so that I'm touching it inadvertently--messing up my position in the document I'm typing--esp. with Word.  Hopefully, it's just different from what I'm used to and I'll get used to it, but right now it's annoying.",

U80V I think is the same as U80A",

                "review_body": "I give only 3 stars to this laptop because it uses a cheap processor.\n\nThe Intel T6600 processor costs less, which is why laptops with this type of CPU cost less, but that is at the expense of some pretty important features.\n\nThe biggest problem is that this laptop's CPU does not support Hardware Assisted Virtualization (VT). This means you cant use the XP mode offered by Windows 7 Ultimate. You cant run VM's on the majority of Virtualization products (VMWARE, VirtualPC).\n\nThere is a workaround for XP mode by using VMLite, but this is the single biggest weak point of this laptop.\n\nOtherwise I find it ok. Returning this laptop for lack of VT means Amazon will charge their usual 15% restocking fee and its not worth that.\n\nMy advise is that if you are a serious user who likes advanced features, look around for a laptop with a better processor. If you are looking for a cheap system with reasonable specs then choose this.\n\nYou will never be able to enjoy Win 7 Ultimate (with all its features) on this laptop. Caveat Emptor.",

                "review_body": "Very good value considering features and price. Was looking for a notebook with 13.3in screen and CD/DVD Player. Couldn't find anything 13.3in with CD/DVD player at reasonable price but at 14in the Asus comes pretty close. Has bluetooth, HDMI, Wireless a/b/g/n and 2.2GHZ cpu, lighted keyboard and multitouch touchpad, all good to have besides the usual base feature set.\n\nAppears too glossy for me and certainly a fingerprint magnet. The mousepad could have been better designed. It's a little bit too small and the clicker feels awkward, but I guess I might get used to it soon. The screen looks very good but the default setup was a little too bright so I adjusted it down a little.\n\nRuns pretty cool and reasonably quiet. Compared side by side with a Sony VGN-SR390 13.3in and I liked the looks of the Sony better. But the U80V is about 500.00 cheaper and the Sony's keyboard is not lighted. I choose the ASUS for features and value but honestly my heart was with the Sony. :-)\n\nEven though advertised as thin, the ASUS is not that thin at about 1.3 in, but comfortable to sit on my laptop and type while watching TV.\n\nOverall, great value!",

                "review_body": "For the past few months, I was looking to replace my old Acer laptop with a new one. I was attracted by ASUS because of their Global Two year warranty and One Year accidental damage. I was looking for a laptop that offers\n- Decent Battery Life\n- Is under 5 lbs\n- 14 inch screen which I think is ideal for desktop replacement at home and also easy to carry around\n- Backlit Keyboard\n- Dedicated Graphics.\n\nI tried two similar laptops but now finally decided to stay with this U80V-B2. The other laptop that were on my list were Toshiba E205 and ASUS UL80.\n\nToshiba E205 -\n I first tried New TOshiba E205 which is recently launched at BestBuy. ALthough E205 has backlit keyboard, slot loading DVD drive and the new Core- i5 processor, I decided to return that beacause- It would get quite warm on the keyboard and touchpad which is rare among ASUS laptops that I have tried. The palm rest of E205 was kinda small and uncomfortable. IT was also not as snappy as I expected although it featured new Core-i5 processor.\n\nASUS UL80-\nAlthough the UL80 has a slim profile with brushed Aluminium lid, featured a Core 2 DUO processor, has rated 8 hrs real life battery life, I missed a backlit keyboard and Bluetooth. The ULV processor was not smooth for some heavy multitasking and the touch pad was a disaster.\n\nFinally I decided that U80V-B2, which is infact a older model than UL80, would best suit my needs at least based on its specification. When I saw its price came down to $ 699 at amazon, I decided to buy it and got it just yesterday. So far I am pretty much impressed with it for the value i paid for it.\n\nThe touch pad is a breeze to use, although its located more towards the right and not in center. The multi-touch features work great. The back-lit keayboard is also awesome since you can adjust the brightness. It has bluetooth so that I have been able to syncronize my cell-phone and use my bluetooth wireless mouse. The laptop remains super cool after a prolong use also and is very quiet. I have been able to get 5 hours battery life on Battery saving mode which is not bad for a 6-cell battery. Overall, its the most efficiently made laptop i have ever tried. You can find more expensive laptops out there, but this laptop gives you back the every penny you invested with features no other laptop gives at that price.\n\nGood Job ASUS !",

And can't be too expensive...And now this is the one for me! I really love it!!\n\nTop lid  :\nBeautiful black and looks pretty expensive. Sometimes you can see blue glitters hidden in the top lid.I was scared the blue glitter will make the laptop looks cheap, but actually you can only see it from specific angle. Overall, it's sleek black just like an elegant piano.\n\nScreen  :\nSharp and Bright!Glossy frame make it looks even more fancier. Wide, comfortable size.\n\nSize  :\nCompared with most of 14\" laptop",

The only thing that could be better is the mouse pad, right click is a little hard to use, but it doesn't take long to get used to it.  Also, the battery life seems a little short, only about 3-4 hrs, but I have yet to fully test that.  Overall, I'm very happy that I got this laptop!",

Since all the ports are hidden, the laptop has a very clean look.  What i love most about the UX is that the screen is flushed making it look very elegant.  The screen brightness is the same as the UL.  The UX is also thinner.  Battery life is ok, not as great as on the UL but i don't mind since i bought this mainly because of the exterior.  The brushed aluminum makes the laptop feels so much more expensive than it really is.  One other thing, the hard drive and battery are not removable.  They have been sealed by Asus so if having a removable battery is important to you, you should look at other models.",

                "review_body": "Simple personal feeling about this Asus UX30\n\nThe Good side\n\n1. Good CPU speed, I'm a student using the laptop mainly for homework/study/web/movies/youtube. It's not a lighting speed one but I'm totally happy with it's performance --- no lag! I think the 4GB ram definitely help.\n\n2. Super thin and sleek outlook and excellent built quality. Asus built the laptop with brushed aluminum on the top and high-end plastic on the bottom, which make it feels like you are holding a $1xxx latop :D,\n\n3. Surprise how light the latop is, I can spin it with my finger! no kidding~ Also the power adapter is the smallest I've ever seen, the adapter is about the length of a lighter and 3 times of it's size and super light as well.\n\n4. Crispy screen playing 1080p video smoothly, No problem using HDMI output on 56inches TV.\n\n5. I think a lot of people would concern about the battery life, well, I can honestly tell you it's really not that bad, for normal web browsing it can last 4.5hrs using the battery saving mode, and don't be scared by hearing battery saving equal to low performance, in fact I just feel the same as the high performance mode except using dimmer screen brightness. The battery is in fact a high end POLYMER battery instead of standard one on other laptops, it's more reliable and has longer life.\n\n6. Asus Express Gate installed. EG let you get on internet do most stuff without booting the windows, it's Linux based os customized for Asus laptop. As advertised get connected online and start browsing the web in 8 Sec (tested, takes 6sec! ^^)\n\n6. Elegant package make you feeling like unboxing a macbook air ^^\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nThe Bad side\n\n1. Weak microphone, I use the video chat on Skype and live messenger a lot, the microphone just doesn't useful as the one who you chat with couldn't hear any but noise from you. Disappointed. Problem Solved by bought a usb audio interface for $9.99, it work perfectly now.\n\n2. It would be a little tough to get used to the touch pad, but in few days, you'll be OK and enjoy, still cant compare to Mac's touch pad.\n\nOverall, it's a great value to purchase this notebook, I'm happy using it everyday in school and home. everything just great. Highly recommended for student or people who love to use their laptop the way I do, Web browsing/homework/movies/Youtube/video chat/\n\n* SU7300 core 2 duo CPU 1.3GHz\n* 4GB ram\n* 320 GB HDD\n* 1.3 MP Webcam (instead 0.3MP in description)\n* 3 cell Polymer Lithium ion\n* NO bluetooth",

I did not wanted to make the same mistake that I made the last time by buying an underpowered pc. This ASUS N61JQ-A1 has a lot of power and it is a beautiful system.  Something that I was concern about when I bough it on-line was the color. On line is described as being a dark brown. It is dark brown but it is so dark that it looks black and in addition the pattern in the design is awesome. I bough mine at Costco on-line because they offer the best return policy that I know of and they had the best price I could find. I was tented to buy the ASUS G51 which has almost the same components and in addition better resolution for a bit more money but I am glad I pick the N61JQ-A1 because of the elegant look. The G51's design is just not cut out for the work environment because of its extravagant looks. The good thing is that the screen resolution has not been an issue for me when I play some games. This is a one for all laptop because it can be used for almost everything and is a very nice machine.\n\nI hope this review helps some body to make up their mind when buying a laptop.",

(remember, we'r talking about a laptop)\n  -core i7 720q; great mobile processor. very capable, its debatable whether or not your better off going with this or an good i5 processor, but it depends what your doing. since I wanted to do mobile 3d modeling and animation, I went with the quad core. the laptop is surprisingly only a fraction slower than my desktop, which is a core i7 950 overclocked w 2 gb more ram.\n  -usb 3.0 + card reader + hdmi + eSATA + bluetooth and more = :)\n\nI would suggest this laptop to anyone. Its fast and capable, and is a suitable solution to my needs. for a quad core processor, and a capable graphics card, most comparable laptops are hundreds more. The only things Im still unhappy with is all the bloatware; it must be newer stuff because I still cant find solid reviews on what I can delete without crippling something. Also, whatever genius decided they needed to partition the hard drive needs to be found and put on an island somewhere where he can do no more damage. with 320gb of hard drive, I would much rather prefer having it all in one place. This is of course fixable with some freeware offline, and if I had more experience with that, I would have fixed the partitions, but I dont, so I didnt. Ill probably just hook up a terabyte hard drive to the esata port eventually anyways, so im not worried. all in all, laptop is a good deal, but for the specs, there are definitely some aspects being sacrificed. (oh and I dont know why they havent figured out yet that I (and most geeks like me) have oily hands. quit making laptops shiny fingerprint magnets!)\n\nUpdate (7/1/2013)\nIts been just over 3 years since I bought this laptop. Its been a fantastic tool. I've reinstalled windows on it a handful of times, and changed out the hdd, and upgraded the ram. just a few months ago I took the whole thing apart to clean out the vents. It's a trooper and is still going strong.",

The price is ok, it looks good, the perfomance is great, the image fairly clear although the sound/speakers are definitely inferior to other laptops. It was carried around only once, mostly sitting in the office and used 2-3 hours/day. Due to its weight/size it is not the most portable laptop anyway - but that's what I expected. However I would have expected the screen to last a little longer than 2-3 months. While watching news on the internet, the screen flickered a little, and then went black. Computer is still starting normally, but without the screen which makes it definitely less useful. Asus hotline hard to understand but friendly, of course unable to help and issued RMA. Will update how the repair is going.",

                "review_body": "I've had this laptop for just over 2 years now, and I have to say, I'm impressed. It has a couple quirks, but for what I payed for it, it's a champ, any issues I had with it I've been able to resolve myself, first off, I'll list the cons that I've run into in my 2 years of laptop ownership.\n\nCONS:\n1. HEAT - This laptop is by no means a lightweight, this is a desktop replacement, boasting a beefy i7 processor that runs standard at 1.6 GHz, and goes up as needed to 2.2. That means this thing pumps out quite a bit of heat, idling usually around 60 degrees Celsius, going up to 85 under max load. That being said, the cooling system used is very efficient, as long as you keep the fan clear (easily reached through the bottom panel) and don't block the port, you won't have issues with it. Not once during the time I've had this laptop has it overheated, through basic use, through Minecraft, Mass Effect, Just Cause, and pretty much anything else I've thrown at it.\n\n2. HARD DRIVE - Just about a year after I got the laptop, the hard drive died in a spectacular crash during use, but as a 320G drive is barely passable these days, not a big issue for me. The issue actually came up after I popped in the nice and roomy new 750GB drive, where a number of windows functions didn't appear to work. This was resolved simply by reinstalling the Intel Storage Utility, as the driver in the laptop didn't fully support drives that large.\n\n3. BSOD - This guy had me stumped for a good long time, randomly during use, I would get a Blue Screen directed towards the USB 3.0 Driver crashing, fiddling with the bios, reformatting, and trying different drivers did nothing, so I chalked it up to a hardware issue UNTIL I discovered that the problem was easily fixable in windows settings. Turns out the 3.0 port doesn't like being put on standby to save power, so just switching all the settings in device manager to not allow windows to do that fixed all problems.\n\nSo, in summary, for the cons, Keep your exhaust port clean and open, Intel Storage Utility for big drives, and power settings for the USB ports in Device Manager. Do this and you'll be as happy as a clam with this laptop.\n\nThe nicest thing I note about this laptop is that it has room to grow, you don't pay through the nose up front for easy upgrades you can make later. Hard Drive? A little small, but it's a standard, just pop in a new one, takes maybe 5 minutes, same with the RAM, starts at 4, and  goes up to 8 whenever you feel like it.",

Bought a generic version of Logitech's clip-on speakers, and it made a world of difference.\n- The fan on its right side seems to be continuously blowing hot air, fortunately the laptop remains pretty quiet\n- Had to update most of the devices on it as the drivers installed were already out of date (BIOS, Chipset, Camera, LAN, WLAN, Bluetooth, USB 3 port, ATI Catalyst, Hotkeys, HDMI Audio, etc.)\n\nWhat Its Missing:\n- A backlit keyboard, though there are hacks on the internet if you want to install one. Personally, I just bought a USB LED light.\n- An option for higher resolution screen as this really would benefit from at least a 1920x1080 display\n- An option for a 9-cell battery\n\nNo other offering from the bigger name brands comes close to this much value. I customized to the same specs and they came out hundreds of dollars more.",

The default drivers just won't do. Upgrade the drivers to the new 10.7 catalyst drivers right away and then if you are lucky it might not crash as often. I wouldn't blame this entirely on the graphics card since Starcraft 2 is have a multitude of problems with ATI graphics cards at the moment.\n\nDragon Age Origins: Same with Starcraft 2 works but crashes from time to time. Make sure to upgrade your dragon age to the newest version and have the 10.7 drivers. I played this game for 5 hrs and it crashed about 3 times. ATI issues same with SC2.\n\nMass Effect 2: Runs very smoothly. No Problems (but have heard on many forums this game had many issues with ATI cards.)\n\nOthers:\n\nFN key not working. Volume/Mute Keys are not working. I had this problem at first but after updated with ATK drivers they worked fine.\n\nThese are just a few of the problems I have personally encountered so far. Perhaps I just got a lemon iono, but after the updates to the drivers the problems seem to have either been fixed or lessened. In regards to the games. It might not necessarily be the notebook's fault, but just a few things to keep in mind. This was from my personal experience hopefully others are luckier and don't experience these problems.",

I bought another one, this one. Do not bother purchasing it. This laptop will suck your time dry. I have had numerous problems that took up many hours of online research, and phone calls, and more money.\nPROBLEMS 1) Within minutes of starting my computer for the first time, I GET the BLUE screen of death. Took me awhile to figure this one out. Unfortunately my left USB port would allow a plug to go in upside down and shorted the system. NO GOOD, 2)Screen quality is junk 3) Video games are not very compatible with this laptop. Many hours fixing bugs and downloading driver updates, and patches. 4) During video games there will be a line that goes across the screen and breaks up the graphics for a split second during cinematic, but frequently and in different locations-just odd. 5)The battery life is horrible, it will say 2 hours-you will be lucky if you get 1 and half.  I thought I read somewhere that this thing got 10 hours! I looked over something there. 6)DVD drive just stopped working. I DO NO KNOW WHY. 7)only three USB ports. 8)I had to buy a recovery cd for 60 dollars!!! because the OS crashed within the 3rd month. 9)MY LEFT mouse Button on the Laptop is starting to be unresponsive-sometimes it does not select it and now I have noticed I am putting much pressure on it to get it to work. 19)The asus live update feature is a scam!! I have never downloaded a driver from it and it always says its up to date-LIARS. HOURS of finding the drives myself. Turns out that the software they offer on there website is ALSO OUT OF DATE. I had to purchase another software (driver genius) to get the right drivers. 11)POOR customer service-long wait on the phone and no one I have talked to so far speaks clear English, but that goes for HP as well. PLAIN AND SIMPLE DO NOT BUY THIS LAPTOP, ALSO DO NOT BUY A ASUS. pure junk. there are no good laptops out there anymore though.... best computer I have ever owned- VPR Matrix. It is still alive and kicking. Never had a problem with it. I bought it 10 years ago. old Pentium 4",

                "review_body": "My father bought this laptop for me as a Christmas present in 2010. It is now May 2015, and I have just given this laptop away to my older brother. This laptop has been my faithful companion for well over 4 years, throughout the end of middle school and much of my High School life. This laptop is special to me, as it has been the first one I'd ever gotten that actually ran the games I wanted to play effectively (my two previous laptops were Dell notebooks and they sucked real bad at gaming).\n\nThe good things about this laptop:\n1) Decent for running games made from at latest 2012 to older (portal 2, skyrim, and anything older run great). Runs smoothly and is capable of handling stressful loads (or at least I remember it being that way). I had a lot of fun times playing games using this laptop for well over 4 years. It never failed me once when it came to performance (however, read the last paragraph on my review for some clarification on how the performance is NOW in 2015).\n2) WINDOWS 7. I cannot stress this enough. Even now I still consider Windows 7 to be a far superior operating system to Windows 8, 8.1 and perhaps someday even 10. It is both user-friendly but not too dumbed-down and \"metro-ified\"\" as Windows 8 is. I like the GUI's smooth edges that are both futuristic but not too bubbly and drab like Windows XP was.

Im writing this in the dark and i can see, so any typos are just bad typing.\nthe battery life could be better, but isnt terrible for a laptop this size. gives about 2 hrs, even with switching to power save mode. the different power modes dont seem to do much except change the brightness. Altho the power save mode does de-color your windows theme and puts a stock Asus background.\n\n**A big part of why i got this model was because it said it comes with powerdvd and power director. it technically does. i havent tried powerdvd yet, but power director is a stripped down version that wont even let you do PiP, which i need for my cover band.*\n\nOther Cons;\n-keyboard feels cheap. seems to warp/bend when you type.\n-mouse does things i dont want it to, like zoom instead of scroll (again, non-laptop guy getting used to it. i also got a regular mouse with it)\n-tons of Asus named software you think will be crucial and part of the system, its not. still have yet to sort out all the required from not\n-IMO it somehow seems a little slower than it should be for a quad core (i7)\n-the Libraries (music, pics, video) in windows 7 are stored in a 116 gb OS partition, which is already taken up by about 75 gb of junk (altho some may be drivers, so dont go nuts uninstalling)\n-screen resolution isnt great either. in a previous review someone said you can just resize it with the mouse pad; that only works for webpages.\n-the turbo boost doesnt seem to do much. you can see the meter revv up if you have itunes open and open IE or something. havent tried any games yet.\n-only has Office starter (excel and stripped down Word)\n-screen has a fair amount of glare.\n\nPros;\n-battery charges quickly\n-runs incredibly quiet and fairly cool for a laptop. loudest thing was the dvd burner revving up\n-comes with Excel and Word (i dont do anything fancy in Word and rarly use PowerPoint anymore)\n-big hard drive\n-good sound (especially when connected to external surround sound)\n-read my microSD when no other computer or external card reader would.\n-the webcam is amusing to play with and put designs or accessories on yourself or change the color or what have you...\n-great graphics card\n-lots of ram. doesnt slow down when i have itunes and some windows open\n-USB 3.0 was nice when transferring everything off my external from my desktop\n\nOverall this computer is good, but as a video editor i dont really know why i switched to a laptop. For anyone else im sure itll work even better than it does for me. Anyone who does something other than film editing and/or who just likes to have a fast computer and alot of space for stuff, this is perfect for.",

I took it in and they reformatted the laptop and took off the hotkeys and it worked again but my features and hotkeys that were supposed to work on the computer no longer worked. After reinstalling the drivers and everything the camera stopped working again. The computer tech and myself came to the realization that Asus made the computer so that if you want all your hotkeys on the keyboard and features to work, they mess with the camera, but if you want your camera to work, you can't use your hotkeys and other features that the laptop is supposed to come with. It is a stupid issue that the company should be held responsible for but will not and have not found a fix to. I'm very sad I spent the money (around $800 at the time) on something that I cannot use all features on. Because I used the camera less often, I had to opt for the keyboard to work the way it was supposed to so I haven't had use of the camera almost since I bought the stupid machine. I will not purchase Asus brand again since the company couldn't even take the time to come up with a simple programming update to fix the issue.

It's clearly not the case.  I should of relied on my intuition.  It's just not possible for a new comer to the scene to establish that level of quality.  Frankly, hate to say it but you can't beat Dell after service for repairs.  My friend also bought an Asus desktop (i7-920) for his work and they've had nothing but issues.  2 years and 1 year accidental sounds nice.  It's not so nice when they don't fix your machine right.  It's not nice that they don't supply shipping materials for the RMA.  It's not nice when they make you pay for Advance Replacement shipping for your parts.  The VP of quality control needs his mai-tai rations taken away.",

I suspect that a lot of these glowing reviews were probably done when the laptop was brand new before it stood the test of time.\n\nI have had this laptop since September 2010 and it's now March 2013. At about a year and a half the fan went out. I replaced it, not a big deal in itself. At about the same time the video card started going out. Suddenly while working the video card puts yellow vertical stripes on the monitor while the system freezes and hangs. I have to power off and restart to use the computer again. The yellow stripe freezes/crashes have become more and more frequent. At first it was a couple times a month, now it is once a day or even more. Now I will have to buy another video card. All my other laptops lasted years without any hardware going bad. Planned obsolescence? Cheap parts and build quality? I don't know.\n\nThe Asus N61JQ-X1 is marketed as USB 3.0, the latest and greatest and \"future proof\"\". What they don't tell you is that ONLY ONE of the THREE USB ports is actually USB 3.0 (the single one on the left side). The other two are USB 2",

Dont let reviews on the screen throw you off. The screen is beautiful. The keyboard is the best in its class. I love this laptop. I also own an asus p6t deluxe desktop with an 17 975 extreme edition and intel solid state that cost me 2300 bucks to build and this laptop is only 30 percent slower than the beast of a tower I have. I must say you cannot go wrong buying it. Oh yes do not buy from newegg because you will have to pay sales tax if your in california.\n\nCons : None I wish I bought this before my desktop and I might have never bought the desktop!\n\nAgain the laptop is beautiful and I get compliments on it everywhere!",

Too much bloatware, but I expected that (and have already deleted most of it), and I hate that they no longer ship Windoze computers with a recovery CD, but that's not ASUS.  I got it the day after Lucid Lynx came out and have it dual booting into Windows and Ubuntu, with both systems running smooth as glass.  The shiny case is a fingerprint magnet, but I never go anywhere without a cleaning cloth, so we're good.  I play WoW at nearly top settings with no noticeable lag even in Dalaran, and that's before upgrading to 8 gigs RAM, which I'm going to do anyway on my next round of frivolous spending.  With regular cleaning and maintenance, and keeping coffee away from it, I should get a good three to five years out of her.  I'm a very happy girlgeek.  Thanks.",

Onboard speakers are actually very good, resolution could be higher, but looks great, gloss finish on the screen does produce glare if not positioned right.  IMO price vs performance, this thing is a 9.5/10 for what it is and what it is capable of, if you know what you are buying, you will not be dissapointed, this is not a desktop replacement, simply because I prefer the performance of a desktop but the N61J performs outstanding considering its a notebook.",

Also, with all of the extras this thing comes with (bluetooth, multi-finger touch-pad, USB 3.0, ect.) you wont have to worry about connectivity and will quickly be able to navigate Windows with the touch-pad shortcuts.

Build quality is sound. Keyboard has a good solid feel and is plenty wide enough. Overall, it's terrific and I would buy another Asus. If you're looking for an excellent laptop at a good price, this is the one, if you ask me. There are a few drawbacks, but nothing major: I don't like the touchpad too much--it seems to have a hard time putting the cursor where I want it and I have to press down fairly hard to get the cursor to move bottom to top. It has a lot of fancy features like three-finger swipe, rotate, etc., but these were kicking in accidentally a lot, so I turned them all off. The screen has a little piece of crud in between the plastic outer cover and the actual display--not a big deal, but like an itch you can't scratch. The external off/on switch for the wi-fi & bluetooth is very handy to have, but it's right next to a USB port and it's easy to hit the switch when changing out devices and turn wi-fi off by mistake (at least with my hands).

The resolution for me is terrible. I always see all these complaints about he resolution of this machine, here is why the resolution is important. Real estate, the higher the resolution the more you can fit on your screen, I am a Web developer and I need to have many applications open at once and the resolution on this computer is awful for this kind of work. If you are just surfing the web, this might be good enough for you, but I would not recommend this for anyone who likes to see a lot of stuff on the screen at once. You will be constantly scrolling. The web cam looks terrible on Yahoo messenger, that did it in for me.",

I promptly sold the dualcore asus I bought in October for the same price and picked this one up and I must say it was well worth it. Dump the bloatware and this thing just what seems to be a limitless about of desktop processing power.\n\nFor single threaded apps it overclocks the clock speed to 2.8ghz, for multi-threaded it uses 1.6ghz two threads per core that works wonderfully in windows 7. As for the gpu I regret that I haven't put much on in the way of games, however I saw a notciable improvement in video playback on both it's led screen and my monitor colors just seem more vibrant and the playback is smoother I don't know if this is just because I haven't used an ati card in awhile or no. The only game I have tried was street fighter 4 everything on max with no AA left me with 60fps at the native laptop resolution.\n\nAs for the case and screen the the led screen is alright, the viewing angle isn't so good thought it is still backlit I would say my other screen was better in fact. As for the case all around the keyboard and keypad is rubber.. I don't honestly know how I feel about this yet, as for the plastic it's pretty chaep it's a good thing this thing comes with a accidental warranty because I have dropped it in the bag while reaching down for something and it left a mark. :-(\n\nall in all you can't beat what this thing packages anywhere else. USB 3.0, I7 CPU, ati direct x 10 1gb gpu, 4gb ram upgradable to 8gb, bluetooth, wireless n. What more can you ask for? Other than ati to upgrade their mobile drivers! ^_^ well worth the price.",

One of the reasons I got it was to replace my older desktop, which the Asus does a great job at for a notebook.  It is larger than many other models an offers plenty of screen and key board space, it is quite at home on my desk.  But I also wanted the versatility of being able to travel with it, and if you don't mind lugging around close to ten pounds it does that as well.  The problem with going mobile is the battery life, you only get about 1.5 hours before the battery warning comes on.  I compromised this feature for all the other great features it does have: crisp, clear and large screen; blistering fast speed, great sound; solid build.  All in all it is a great notebook but not sure if it is worth the money at over $1000.00 with so many others available at far less, but again I haven't experienced them either so maybe not.  I am happy with mine and would recommend it to anyone that can afford it and is not looking for the best value neccessarily, just looking for the best.",

The i7 and the Mobility Radeon HD 5730 make this machine the beast it is. When I set out to buy a laptop back in 2010 I was looking for a desktop replacement that could run the Adobe Creative Suite and play games too. I work a lot in Photoshop, Indesign, After Effects and Premier Pro so I needed a beefy machine. Three years later and I'm still creating with zero glitches or lag using Adobe CS6.\n\nNow about a year ago I did experience overheating on both the processor and video card which resulted in the laptop turning off. Note that the laptop always runs 8-10 hours a day in high performance. The symptoms appeared when I began playing Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. In response to the issue, I loaded GPU-Z and realtemp.exe and diagnosed it as overheating. I suspect that those other reviewers who have had video card failure experienced overheating. Now check this out. After I collected the overheating data I contacted Asus even though the laptop was out of warranty. I informed them of the situation and they promptly sent me a label to send in the laptop. I had the laptop back in two weeks. I'm not bothered by the overheating because Asus support is topnotch in my book. They've made me a brand loyal customer. I bought two of my kids Asus laptops for Christmas.\n\nAnyway, if I had a complaint it is with the battery life. It died in its 13 month. In short, Asus stands behind there product and this product is rock solid in it's 3rd year.",

For the price alone, with a core i7 processor added with their warranty (which I hope I won't claim), no doubt that this is one of the most affordable units out there. It's not as stylish compared to others but looks are subjective, this unit appears to me, both elegant and contemporary. Besides, I didn'y buy this for it's looks but for it's power. Just read the specs and drool. It has a nice well-spaced chiclet keyboard(not lighted) which is comparative to a Vaio, lots of ports and connectors and the latest USB 3.0. Drawbacks that I encountered though which you will read also from other reviews are the low screen resolution which I really don't mind, besides that's what having an LED/LCD HDTV for; the vent on the side tends to get hot. I bought a fan for it though amazingly, the bottom part is cool; sensitive touch pad but I use an optical mouse so not really a concern. I suggest you buy an extra long lasting battery as this computer drains your battery fast especially when you are mobile.\n\nUpdate : 12/14/2016\nStill running ok after 6 1/2 years...except for the bloatware, i love this laptop.",

The keyboard gives a nice resistance when typing (almost as if it has some kind of magical 'type-assist'#....as well as plenty of space between the keys.  The other comments regarding resolution are somewhat right, depending on what you're doing with it.  The Video Magic software from ASUS allows for enhancement for videos, and I've been impressed with the output.  The only disappointment would be if you do a lot of work in PS CS4...the resolution isn't the best for fine-tuning high-res photos.  Not really a big deal.\n\nThe only other downside is that my webcam is upside down.  Jeers to ASUS for not yet addressing this problem with this model on their website.  I used a 3rd Party workaround and it seems to work now #in most cases#.\n\nOtherwise, great speed....loaded CS4 in under 30 minutes and it boots Photoshop CS4 in under 10 seconds, twice as fast as my duo core HP.\n\nOverall, for the price, this laptop is hands-down a GREAT value.",

You have to hold it it bright light to see this however which is elegant in my opinion) and others are just plain stupid. This laptop is hands down awesome. It does run hot, but the i7 720qm thermal specification is 100c!!! Don't worry about it running in the mid 50's to 60's range. Just make sure you turn the power cord to the back or it sort of obstructs the fans; which are dead silent. I will be buying a cooler pad for this. It has a 2-3 hour battery life depending on your battery settings. But if you are buying this machine, you are aware that the components you're buying are not low power, economy parts. They are parts designed for making your life simple and easy with regard to your laptop. And they are very successful. Windows boots to idle extremely fast and NOTHING I have done so far has caused so much as a hiccup. Streaming Pandora, running UTorrent, up to 15 Firefox tabs running, pulling viedo files off my network and burning a dvd simultaneously? The 4 physical and 4 logical cores barely move. Feel free to check your email in the meantime. I would recommend reinstalling windows 7 with the disc to a single drive. You will have to reinstall the drivers and whatnot, but this is a very simple task. It eliminates the bloatware others have complained about. By the way, the bloatware didn't slow this thing down a hair the first time I booted her up. The touchpad is as good and better than any other. I did buy the wireless microsoft mouse and I also recommend it. Wireless N shows 150 mb/s for me and I get full signal with a netgear wndr3300 throughout my house.\nThe ONLY problem I could imagine, unless you're a tool and think not having xp is a problem, is that the screen can be glossy. Doesn't bother me though. Otherwise, plug the HDMI into a plasma 50 inch or something and watch the 5730 ati really tear it up! Pull the trigger.... Buy it.",

Starcraft only wants 6Ghz of the CPU. This laptop expresses massive stress if that you are using it for streaming your live games.\n\nAsus will not answer you for any of your technical help.\n_________________________\n\nWell, I've personally gave it a solid state drive instead of a Hard drive. Upgraded it to the Windows 7 Ultimate, and the Asus compatible to it. the laptop comes with its 1 CD of drivers that'll cover everything in a single installation (it'll take about 20 minutes to install all everything from the mobo plug-in play).\n\nThe GPU feels like a 650Mhz core clock, making the 1GB of ram GPU extremely useless. The vid card is only strong enough to run on medium settings of your games such the Street Fighter 4, but stronger than the xbox360's ATI GPU. The Ultimate settings on Starcraft 2 demands 1GB of the GPU ram, but it no longer runs at 60fps but very poor performance. You'll want to stay at medium for its 60-fps at the very high resolutions. This laptop GPU doesn't have a logic with going faster fresh rate of frames at a smaller resolution, only at the highest HD resolutions it attends to go faster at 60fps medium settings. The Street Fighter 4 medium settings hits it beautifully at 60fps with only the use of the GPU ram of 136mb.\n\nThe CPU's FSB is a dream come true when it comes to the loading times with the solid state. It'll make the ram feels like 1666Mhz than it is originally 1066mhz. No needing to wait for a boot, truly instant.\n\nBattery experience:\nWithout any heavier game application, it last 1 hours and 48 minutes. With the heavier game application it'll last 38 minutes.\n\nHm... The USB 3.0 isn't compatible with my Sprint on the road wireless G4 net speed, only the 2.0 on the other side of the laptop.\n\nThe CPU is a Bonifiede pro. There was nothing that I can do to stress it, putting my desktop to shame to put away from the last 3 weeks ago.",

When I ordered this laptop I was worried I would get the UK keyboard layout with the large return key and the backslash key in a inconvenient location.  When I received the laptop I was pleased to find that it was the standard US keyboard layout with large enter, backspace, shift, and control keys which is a nice change from other laptop keyboards that have smaller keys.\n\nColor:\nThe page says the color is dark brown but appears black under almost all conditions, a plus in my book.  I had to shine the back with an LED flashlight for it to appear brown.  I haven't taken outside in direct sunlight but it may appear more brown outside.\n\nBuild quality:\nI would rate this a medium.  It shouldn't break under normal use but it doesn't look as sturdy as some others. Very bright white LEDs on both sides of the laptop blink when in standy mode or when powered on make the laptop distracting in a darker room.  I like the quiet fan volume.  Even the DVD drive is fairly quiet.  Screen hinges look nice and shouldn't break easily.\n\nPerformance:\nWindows 7 boots fast!  Windows Experience Index of 5.9. Runs most all modern games on high quality.  Great performance for the price.\n\nPorts:\nAside from the standard ports, this laptop has an HDMI port with audio out, one USB 3.0 connector, an eSATA connector!\n\nBundled software:\nComes with standard game demos, Office 2007 trial, and various ASUS utilities.  Nothing special but not nearly enough to be considered bloat-ware.  Comes with Windows 7 and driver re-install disc as well as recovery disc maker software.\n\nAudio:\nGreat sound quality for laptop speakers. No noticeable distortion even at high volume!\n\nBattery life:\nMediocre, I average about 2 hours in power saving mode.  But what do you expect from a gaming laptop with an i7 processor?  Get a netbook if you want battery life :)\n\nWarranty:\nGreat warranty, came with one free year of accidental damage protection.",

Specs are widely available, and for all the number-crunchers there are all sorts of benchmarks available on the internet.  But to comment on some things that stand out during practical, everyday useage:\n1. Battery life - Horrendous, but you would expect this when buying.  Power-saving measures help but don't hope for more than 2 hours unplugged in most usage situations.\n2. No backlight on the keyboard - would certainly hurt point #1 even more, but the benefits would greatly outweigh the costs.\n3. Heat - doesn't bother me at all as its rarely on my actual laptop.\n4. Noise - super quiet laptop, you can barely hear the fan during normal use.\n5. Overall performance - I've yet to find myself complaining about the computer being too slow.  I've done some fairly CPU-intensive work on this laptop and quite a bit of multi-tasking and it hasn't missed a beat.\n6. USB 3.0 - spectacularly fast, a real genuine plus.\n7. Bloatware - easily removed in a matter of minutes upon first receiving the laptop.\n8. Weight - light enough for what it does, but no featherweight.  I carry it up and down stairs often, move it around the bed and the desk with no problems.  Its not bulky.\n9. Keyboard and touchpad - keyboard takes some getting used to, but the full number pad is nice.  Multi-gesture touchpad works decently well but one of the greatest frustrations with this entire laptop is how sensitive/exposed the touchpad is to your palms accidently moving the mouse with the touchpad while typing.  I do not have huge hands, and it happens ALL THE TIME.  Very frustrating.",

I use my laptop primarily for music production and daily internet usage but I also ran the Lost Coast HL2 stress test with everything (AA, reflections etc) maxed out and it was averaging well over 100fps.  Windows 7 compatibility has been a dream compared to the hassles I am used to with XP Home-- my FireWire 1814 box connects through a TI expresscard firewire adapter with no problems in Ableton Live.\n\nThe computer keyboard gets some getting used to if you are familiar with the Delete key being the top right-most key... as with all newer Asus laptops, they include a condensed numpad layout on the right side of the keyboard that adds the home/break/printscreen buttons up where I'm used to finding Del.  I think the benefits of having the numpad will outweigh this problem once I get used to it.\n\nI read reviews stating that things like spread sheets were impossible to see on this computer because of the screen resolution... this is simply not true.  I formatted a book (spreadsheets involved!) and designed a book cover using this screen and it worked fine.  I do agree with people who have criticized the viewing angle of the screen though--At ordinary angles the image looks incredibly washed out and visibility is restricted to a tight range of screen positions for any given viewer--not ideal for watching movies on the laptop screen.\n\nBut!  With HDMI out, I plan to use an external monitor at some point and bypass all of the screen concerns entirely.\n\nThe computer removes heat VERY efficiently, but that means that anything in front of the vent on the left hand side will become very hot, so be careful! (i've melted one chapstick and one chocolate bar by placing them somewhere nearby during gameplay use).  Overall this computer just blows my mind.  I can alt-tab out of a game, start a music program, and open 10 chrome pages, all at the same time and it won't break a sweat.  For instance, the computer runs the dolphin emulator flawlessly on low settings (this is a pretty demanding emulator).\n\nAnyways, I researched computers for a couple days straight and this one was by far the best deal i could find for under $1000.  Buy this right now if you are even slightly interested!  Hah, WORD OF WARNING:  Amazon shipped my latptop in its original Asus box with pictures and specs of the laptop all over it--I would recommend selecting gift wrapping if you don't want people knowing that a valuable product is inside.

And YES I knew the specs going in and took a chance but well you can't fight the numbers sometimes.\n Yes, the older LT display is significantly better. Much darker blacks, hence better contrast. Phillip/LG made the screens for the Gateway back when and they are excellent, near Plasma black levels I dare say. Now granted the Gateway is a 17\" 900 screen where the ASUS is only 15.6 /768 but if you are using Adobe/Lightroom or Nikon Capture NX2 you will be disappointed",

                "review_body": "I've had this computer for about a year now, so I can offer a review here without the bias of that initial haze of excitement.\n\nPros:\n-The technical specs are good. I'm not a hardcore gamer, but I've been able to run everything I've wanted to run smoothly except GTAIV (but performance-wise, that game is broken anyways), including WoW, The Sims 3, Civilization V, and the Total War series, all on high settings. Light modeling and Photoshop also ran with no issues.\n\nI've listed a lot more cons than pros, but keep in mind that the pro is an important one.\n\nCons:\n-If you use this computer on your lap, it runs uncomfortably hot. I mean it.\n-The power cord comes off very easily. Moving it around almost ensures that it will fall out. Again, if you use this on your lap, I guarantee it's going to go unplugged unnoticed at least once.\n-Gets dirty easily.\n-The screen seems to make contact with the keyboard when the lid closes, so the grime from the keyboard occasionally gets on the screen.\n-Not recommended if you are the sweaty palm type. Heat + prone to grime + sweaty palms = very, very bad. I'm constantly cleaning the area to the left of the touchpad where my palm rests because it's constantly gross. I never had such an issue with my other laptops.\n-Too big to frequently carry around (I'm a college student). I had to offset this by purchasing a netbook.\n\nAs neither a pro or a con, it makes a moderate amount of noise. It does get noticeable while gaming.\n\nIn the end, I'd recommend this computer if you're only in it for the specs and the price. As for me, I wish I would have looked more into other factors, like size, heat, and comfort before making my purchase. It runs everything I need to, but it's uncomfortably large, hot, and dirty. Take this as you will; it would probably be fine if it just sat on a desk.",

Within a couple of weeks she was complaining that it ran very hot and had very poor battery life. A few weeks after that the hard drive began to make funny sounds and then the computer would not boot. Tech support at ASUS said that she should send the computer in for service and that the turnaround would be more than a week. She did not have the luxury of not having a computer for that length of time as much of the course material was being presented online. She goes to school three hours away, so I drove to her school and switched out her computer for an older laptop that I had. I ordered a new hard drive, installed it and restored the computer to its original state, and I thought that was the end of it. But a few weeks later, the computer was freezing multiple times a day, and she had to reboot each time. She then informed me that she was so frustrated that she bought a MAC!\nI updated the drivers and removed all the software except the OS and it no longer \"froze\"\". I have been using this computer ever since with minimal software loaded at startup",

I am not computer savvy but needed a laptop for my classic ipod collection, connecting remotely to work, and various things like Microsoft office and tons of time in the internet.  I am not a gamer but figured a gaming computer would give me the power and speed I wanted.  I went strictly by ratings on Amazon.  I'm not disappointed by the computer. It's great because it is new and obviously faster.\n\nLike other reviewers have said, yes, the computer looks black to me not brown.  Only upon close inspection in the sunlight can you see there is a bit of brown.  Also This does NOT come with anything but a trial of Microsoft Office-you will need to buy word, excel  etc since there is no alternative like Microsoft works on the computer.\n\nPros:\nLove the ten key on the side. This is a must for me.\nLike the touch sensor where you can scroll and zoom; it was easy to learn.\nGood size monitor but not too big.\nLove windows 7 which I find very intuitive.\nLove there is tech support included from Asus.\nComputer keyboards seems a little more enclosed making it tougher for crud to get under keys.\n\nCons:\nThough not bad, it's not the nicest looking computer. Toshiba and Sony are going to look and ergonomically feel better though you won't get as high of ratings overall with those.\nThis does NOT come with anything but a trial of Microsoft Office-you will need to buy word, excel  etc since there is no alternative like Microsoft works on the computer.\nThough I love the touch sensor that you can scroll and zoom with your fingers I still find it easier to use a mouse.\nComputer gets hot-you need a cooling pad for sure. Hardly a con for me though-has not slowed me down.\nWith the shiny surface of the comp it is like a magnet for pet hair.",

If you're getting this laptop I wouldn't count on this feature.\nIt feels surprisingly light.\nThe hinge is sturdy - i expect it to last.\nThe sound: I can see both opinions - it can sound tinny - but it's also... guess what? A laptop. And no, there isn't cell phones with better speakers - although i've seen some that are pretty close to this. There just isn't any lows, and barely any mids - if you really want good sound, ignore the hype Asus created in their advertisement of these speakers (all that's really exciting about it is that the normal laptop speakers are arranged in some special way-and it comes with some tuning software) and get a pair of some decent desktop speakers. Don't expect any miracles with the sound. That being said, the built-ins are decent laptop speakers (the stereo effect will certainly surprise you). & They are plenty louder than my Macbook's built-ins - so i'm not disappointed with it. The sound required some minor tweaking in the SRS software to get it to my liking.\nThe hand rest is a fingerprint magnet, I can tell it's going to be difficult to keep clean - the fingerprints go on, but they don't wipe off as easy as if it were a gloss plastic.\nThe back, indeed looks black. It's pretty & understated.\nThere isn't a terrible amount of bloat-ware.. I uninstalled all of the game trials and a few other programs and that was all i had to do.\nIt's pretty thin for a laptop this size - not fat looking like those terrible HPs\nMine came with 1333 ram.\nI created a backup DVD set when i got the laptop - and that took about 2 hours (compressing the files, creating an iso, and burning 4 discs) with the supplied backup software.\nI haven't run down the battery yet - but it says about 1.5 hours.\nThe video card is...awesome. I ran Battlefield Bad Company 2 (a DX11 game) on all of the highest settings (8x anti-aliasing, highest resolution etc.) And it ran perfectly except for a bit of slow down during massive explosions etc. - but, when the anti-aliasing is turned down to 4x it runs just fine.\nI was planning on getting an X25M SSD for this laptop - but...It doesn't really need it! Boots up in seconds... Photoshop opens in about 4-5 seconds...\nI saw today that apple revamped their macbook & MBPs - and after looking at them - I would still buy this laptop. It's $1,800 cheaper... And the hardware is still better. Besides that, I am really impressed with windows 7 - After a few days I don't miss anything from OSX.",

It didn't last very long on battery power, but hey, that's what you get with a dedicated graphics card and a i7 processor. It did everything flawlessly, it was fast, and it played my games like a champ. Street Fighter IV and StarCraft II ran perfectly on the machine.\n\nAfter about a year, after the warranty was up, the problems started happening. It would overheat like crazy. If you put your finger on the part of the keyboard above the vent, it would start to burn. Then it started to shut down while playing games. While initially I had StarCraft II on high settings, I had to put it down to the lowest possible settings to even play the game. After a while, this didn't even help, the laptop still shut down. Then I had tried a cooling pad under the laptop, that didn't help at all. I installed a temperature program on the laptop and it showed that the CPU and GPU would go to 210+ degrees F when playing games, and stay at 190+ while browsing the web. I can't even play a HD video on my laptop without it shutting down now. If I watch Netflix, I have to watch in low resolution and not HD because it'll stutter and the audio and video gets out of sync.\n\nI finally found a fix, a small tabletop fan pointed at the vent would cool it down enough that I could play my games without the computer shutting down on me. Unfortunately, this fan is also pointing directly at my fingers, so it gets hard to type -- especially in the winter. The fan has to be on almost constantly now, otherwise the computer WILL overheat and shut down.\n\nI called Asus technical support, they were wonderfully unhelpful. They wanted me to update the BIOS, I did and that didn't help one bit.\n\nAnd just a week ago, my HDD crashed. I still have no idea why. The computer just wouldn't recognize that a HDD was inserted at all. So I had to get a new one. And so it definitely wasn't a software related issue, the computer is still overheating.\n\nI called Asus again, and they said that the only thing I could do was to send it in for repairs. I'm out of warranty, so it's going to cost me. I can't even get an upfront estimate of the cost, the guy said that they would call me and tell me after they checked it out. So I have to spend the money to send it in and wait probably a month to get a call, just for an estimate of the repair price.\n\nThis isn't just my laptop too, my cousin has an Asus laptop and he has the same exact problem with his. I think Asus used to be a reliable brand, it seems they've started to use extremely unreliable and cheap parts for their laptops. I also have a Asus netbook that is a 400 dollar paperweight.\n\nI think it's safe to say I'm never buying an Asus product ever again.",

                "review_body": "Ok so I just got this notebook about a week ago and I had it up and running in no time. My first impression of it is that the color is better than described on amazon. Like others said, it's a very dark brown that can easily pass for black. The screen and the back are a huge fingerprint magnet though. If you are a neat freak like I am, this may be a little problem. I literally clean the screen every 5 minutes ( not that bad though cause i kinda actually like cleaning it :D).\n\nAll that aside, this thing is very fast. I had no problems running multiple programs and graphics intensive games at the same time. BTW, i'm not a gamer or anything and haven't tested a lot of games on it but this plays Sims 3 well. There is a lot of initial bloatware installed on this thing, but I actually decided to keep most of it as this notebook could handle it anyway and most of them were not that bad.\n\nNow it's time to get to my big complaint. For those of you who don't know, this notebook comes preinstalled with 3 partitions. 1 is the Recovery, about 16gb. 2 is the OS(main) about 75 gb and the 3rd was Data with about 200 something gb. I REALLY HATED THIS! Within my first week of using this my OS was just about out of space, so I decided to do what I should have done when I first got it, which was to do a clean install and re-partition the hard drive. I backed up all my data and used the asus built in recovery (F9) procedure. Everything went fine until the process was completed and it told me to shut down. When I tried to start it back up, THE SCREEN WOULD NOT COME ON. Nothing I did worked so I had to call ASUS tech line. I must admit that the service was fast and easy. They told me I would have to send it back for service. I'm in the process of sending this back now.\n\nAlthough my little mishap, I still recommend this notebook. I think my problem was random. Maybe just a bad recovery procedure or something. My advice to new owners is to burn the back up cd's and just use those if you want to re partition the drive.\n\nWhen I get this back, I'll update on my experience with ASUS tech service and any other thing I can think of.",

I am very happy that I purchased this laptop. It is very fast everything runs great on this machine. This is my first Asus laptop and I am so so so happy I purchased it. I am a big gammer so all of the games I have played have worked without any problems on high settings. I play mostly MMORPG type games, so I have played WOW, ROM, Atlantica, and soon Star Craft 2, every game I have thrown at this computer it has worked without a problem.  I also run alot of programs because I am currently in school so I have alot of applications open, and I have my browser open with prob over 20 + tabs, and I have multiple games running in the background along with my Norton working in the background and other background services and this thing DOES NOT SKIP A BEAT. With all that going on I haven't seen this computer over-clock it self yet so its well worth getting the Asus i7 series laptops. The volume is great on some things and others its pretty crappy, the screen is awesome I am not sure what everyone is complaining about because it looks great to me. The keyboard is a chicklet type keyboard but I love it, it doesn't flex on the left side well not on my computer so I am not sure where people are getting that from either, but then again I don't type really hard, I am very fast lite typer, but I have typed hard to see if it flexes and it doesn't so maybe its just their computer. Some people are complaining that there is not a backlight on the keyboard, well all I have to say about that is it would be nice but I type without looking at the keyboard so it really doesn't matter to me.\n\nNow the only bad thing I have to say is the laptop is a finger print magnet and a dust magnet because I am always cleaning this beast LOL. The color is a very dark dark brown and you can't tell it is a brown color unless its under direct light but it doesn't bother me because it looks very professional and I like that. It does get a little hot on the left hand side but the fan does a good job keeping it cool. I did buy a laptop cooler but I don't think it really needs it but I use it anyways and it keeps it pretty cool, but this a laptop after all with alot of power so what can you expect it will get hot sometimes! Over all this is a great computer for just the causal user or for someone who needs alot of power. If you can get this computer when its on sale then grab it, even if you can't the price amazon is offering for this computer is still wonderful because I did alot of research and you can't get this much power with this size screen with any other computer or for the same computer from a different company its more expensive. I had doubts about buying this computer at first and after doing alot of research at least a week worth of research reading reviews and all sorts of thing and I still found that this is a freakin awesome computer from an awesome company. If your a gammer then get this beast it will handle all your games, if you need power for other things and software then this is the computer for you. Like it says its an entertainment laptop I have viewed HD movies on here and it is so amazing, I use headphones ofcourse so the sound comes across great, im a computer geek and very picky so if i suggest this computer to other people then its good. Just Buy It.",

Not great for the price, but good.\n\nPros: has great sound, which is important to me. the SRS Premium Sound panel takes alot of playing with to get a good sound with whatever speakers you are using. I normally hate laptops mostly cause the mouse pads, but they copied Apple (in a good way) and made it so you can use 2 fingers anywhere on the pad and scroll instead of having a scroll bar on the side or whatever. I've found myself using other laptops and being confused by their lack of convenience. USB 3.0 makes transferring all my data alot easier and my phone and ipod charges super quick when i use the usb cable.\n\nCons: only a few days after the 30-day zero bright dot warranty expired i found a few dead pixels, that strangely seem to come and go. the entire thing is very flimsy; the keyboard depresses quite a bit when typing and the screen flexes as if nothing is behind the screen giving it support. it comes with a TON of preloaded games and Asus software, some of which im afraid to uninstall for fear of messing up the OS or BIOS. Pay attention to where your pictures and music and things are saved, as the default path leads to the smaller \"OS\"\" partition and it will fill up very quickly. The mouse gets annoying and worn out fairly quick. Even with trying to adjust the sensitivity it either grabs on to an internet tab or something and wont let go or it has a hard time double clicking. The webcam is less than 1 mp",

Wow...nostalgic\nThe N61JQ-X1 did give me my first BSOD as well as the yellow/blue squares *for me* before I crashed just about 3 months or so after i purchased it in april 2010. However, what I quickly realized is that those crashes were also due to the laptop's heat, and i'm sure you know what i'm talking about. I live in the Caribbean so I can definitely testify about the laptop's heat generation. About a year or so though, after trying to combat this problem by directing a fan to it *since my room doesnt' have AC unlike the computer lab when I was in high school*, this wasnt' going to work anymore. Afte putting it on, I noticed through some temp monitors that my processor and gpu were reading about..80 to 90 degrees (celcius) on regular/idle states, and the room temperature for me here was/is about 30 degrees during the day. I tried applying thermal paste *arctic silver* to the cpu and gpu, but, I didn't notice any drastic change -- only by about 2 degrees. So yeah, about...6 months from this post, I decided to start eliminating the temperature spike by removing the back panel and, it's dropped by 20 degrees now. Oh and I was using the cooler from the time I got the laptop by the way. However, despite all these problems, I'm still impressed by the laptop. I can even run Crysis 3! Back in the day, I could've run Gears of war, Resident Evil 5, Call of Duty  MW2 on max settings. Lol. It takes your back. But this baby isnt' out yet and isnt' close to that.\n\nI'm not sure why others have experienced worse problems such as the loss of their fans etc., but I guess I was one of the fortunate one to notice how to counteract this heat problem a bit quickly. Currently, I have windows 8 instaleld on it, 64 bit, *pro version* and it's running quiite smoothly. No problems, except of course, the heat, and this darn webcam problem I've experienced since 2011, where it keeps telling me that another program is using it etc. and yeah, I've tried a lot to fix this issue.\n\nBut the point is, I'm quite pleased with this laptop. It's given me sooo much service, and I'll continue to use it happily, just not as continuously now, as I've been using it literally for at least 8 hours every day since 2010. It's amazing to see how far we've reached in just 3 years, since this laptop uses about 34% more power than the average laptop at the moment.\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/2RNKFQSJQDVX2/ref=topnav_lists_1\n\nThis is the rig I'm building and I shall be building it when the rest of the parts come a few days after I post this. I've moved onto the desktop stage, and perhaps next year, I'll go with Asus again, but this time, with the haswell processor and perhaps the maxwell gpu. However, I'll go with less rigorous specs.\n\nBut overall, I'm quite pleased with this laptop, and I thank Asus for designing this. It's served me well in its. Now it's time to move on to the desktop gaming rig big boys!",

                "review_body": "I had the experience of working with two of these N61s. The first was exchanged due to what appeared to be a hardware failure, or hardware in the process of failing. On three occasions the computer suddenly lost power. All power. Which appeared linked to the use of the supper USB port on the left hand side of the machine, as two of the outages occurred subsequent to its use. The second machine did not experience this problem.\n\nAs well, there were two issues with the display on both machines, one of which could have been adequately addressed had tech support been on the ball. The other had to do with very poor color rendering. Both machines had a very strong blue hue that was difficult to get rid of.  As well the black levels were just poor, and the screen was a dust magnet. As to the reference to Asus tech support. I tried vigorously to implement my own color management profile, but neither comp would retain my color settings profile when emerging from sleep or hibernation, and sometimes from off. This as it turns out is a Windows 7 issue, not Assus. But their tech support apparently were not aware and futiley tried to solve it . So this added to my frustration, as i assumed it was an Assus issue. With the Sony I have now, I have since created a sufficient work around to bring up my color settings. Had I known this at the time, I may have kept the second machine.\n\nColor management issues aside, the distinct blue hue was less pronounced with the replacement machine and after a system reinstall, as suggested by Assus tech support, I got an ok picture.  The first machine was just too poor.\n\nOther than these issues, the display is a dust magnet, the resolution needs to be higher and the black levels need to be improved. As well, the keyboard could have been a bit more solid. And then there was the side lights that all together could have and should have been done with out.\n\nOn the positive side. The computer itself seemed pretty awesome. It was very quick with startup, running office, firefox and looking at videos, sometimes all at once. And it ran cool and quiet.  I also liked the rubber skin, was a nice addition.\n\nAs I stated, had tech support been more on the ball, I may have kept the machine.  The black levels and lower resolution didn't bother me so much as it did my tech savy friend.  The dust may have become annoying over time.  But the computer itself seemed pretty great.\n\nLooses one star for the display issues and another for the poor tech support, poor quality of the first machine and the other minor negatives.",

                "review_body": "I was excited to get my hands on this laptop after I had read all the customer reviews on amazon that indicated how much of a steal this product was. But after using this laptop for about a month, I am slightly disappointed with some of its features.\n\nThe build quality of the laptop is not that great. It feels as if I were to drop it just three feet from the ground, the laptop would cease to function. I was taken aback by this, as my previous toshiba laptop was $400 dollar cheaper than this laptop but was much sturdier. Another low point of the laptop is that the speakers are awful, just plain awful. I still do not understand why asus decided to use such cheap sounding speakers in such an expensive laptop. There is absolutely no bass in it. The build quality is easy to forgive because if you handle your laptop carefully, it should not suffer any kind of damage. But the speakers are something that every owner of the laptop would utilize in their day to day activities. Why did asus decided to cut their corners on this? I would have gladly paid additional $50 if the onboard speakers were of higher quality.\n\nother than my above mentioned grievances, the laptop is good for what it is. The i7 cpu and ATI 5730 GPU allow for laptop to function smoothly. As other users have mentioned, there is a fair amount of bloatware when you first boot it up. The following guide helped me a lot in getting rid of all the bloatware: [...]\n\nI played splinter cell conviction and dragon age origins on this machine and both games ran smoothly on medium to high settings. The laptop does heat up a fair amount when you are playing games but that is to be expected. The laptop also features multi touch touchpad and since this is my first time using a touchpad of this kind, I found the experience to be amazing. The laptop also features a single usb 3.0 port but I don't own any devices with usb 3.0 connectors; so that's that. The keyboard is not full sized but in the last month I have gotten used to placement of all the buttons. It's not amazing but not a deal breaker either. The battery life is about 2 hours and you can stretch it to 3 hours by dimming down the screen brightness and switching devices like bluetooth off.\n\nI am giving this product 3 stars because from a hardware standpoint, there is no other laptop out right now that can match this one at the same price point. Plus, other companies charge at least additional $100 for the warranty plan that asus gives on this laptop for free. I really wish that this laptop had better speakers because then this laptop would have been perfect.",

                "review_body": "After a very bad experience with an Asus N10Jh-A1 and due to Asus having a good reputation for laptops- a second unit was tried, the N61Jq-X1 (A1 is same except for having 2 year warranty).  Amazon has changed it's ad for this laptop since our company purchased this unit, as it does not have the TV grade, additional amplifier and cone speakers etc, which was advertised.  Asus website still has these features listed, including a really nice video touting their laptop.  Simply doesn't exist on N61Jq units.\n\nTurned the laptop on for the first time, providing name /date/time, password and reached the create the System Restore DVD's (four required)part of setup. Inserted first new DVD disc and a half hour later, this laptop Blue Screened, BSOD, on SETUP.  When finally back at the point of doing the Restore discs for second time, the second attempt to do Disc #1, few minutes later another error box and BSOD again.  This is going well. Now on third attempt to do Disc #1 which started at 26% ?? and later, FOUR hours later, the four dvd backup discs are finished.  Don't expect I could trust these discs to Restore anything.  Day Two: ASUS was sent all the technical stuff (codes and information beyond my technical expertise, hoping only to provide Asus with information to fix the problem, OR be able to find out it's not repairable, information easily found using Windows 7 which I believe is the best thing Microsoft has done in some time and gasp! might even be better than XP.  Four separate emails and tech numbers from Asus later, the Asus techs are still talking about SRS drivers and issues nothing to do with BSOD.  Since initial setup, the unit in the past three weeks BSOD two more times while watching two movies from internet.  Interesting only for having nothing to do with DVD drive in unit.  The N61Jq-X1 as of yesterday is on it's way back to Amazon.  Going to purchase a Sony VPC-F111FX/H  or if Amazon takes forty days to credit the N61 like they did the N10, will order one directly from Sony.\n<Note, clarify previous remark: Amazon is normally very good at returns and taking care of customers problems, and Amazon is a vendor our company will pay a  little more to buy from Amazon due to this customer service.  Everyone will have a bad day, so I wanted to be fair and temper the remark made here with additional facts.  In the big universe of vendors wanting your money, you'd be hard pressed to find a company doing better by their customers than Amazon.  Dillon Precision is one, they're out there, but the bar is up high.>\n\nIt is likely in the universe of all the laptops which Asus produces that a couple of 'lemons' will come from their factory.  Have two big issues with ASUS,  First is their Tech Service from two different laptop, our experiences with ASUS Tech department in the past six months is deplorable.  Second, I have a real BIG problem when a manufacturer touts features and hardware that is NOT actually in the laptop.  Go to Asus home website  asutech or [...],, go to Products, to Laptops, Multimedia units, then click on N61, then click on N61Jq  or any N61J  code,, look at the Sound System you should have,  Watch Asus video...THE SOUND SYSTEM, SPEAKERS/AMPLIFIER ETC. JUST ISN'T THERE.  AMAZON IS CURRENTLY CHANGING SEVERAL WEBSITES ADS SINCE THE INFORMATION ASUS FURNISHED THEM WAS WRONG.  INDEFENSIBLE TO SELL A PRODUCT WHICH FALSELY DESCRIBES THE HARDWARE THE CUSTOMER IS EXPECTING TO RECEIVE FOR HIS MONEY.\n\nJust wanted to balance out the rave reviews,, I'm sure Asus does make some good units,  the free information is always worth what it costs you.  davzway/  TSRW INC",

                "review_body": "I bought this computer as a replacement for a Macbook with a 2.0 Ghz Core Duo, which was really starting to show its age. Boy did I get my money's worth.\n\nPros:\n-Chiclet keyboard, my preferred keyboard style.\n-i7 processor. I can run everything my heart desires and this computer doesn't skip a beat.\n-Radeon 5730. I finally got a chance to play Portal on a computer (my Macbook wouldn't even run it). Nearly every setting is maxed out on the recommended settings, and those that aren't maxed out are only a notch down. Same with Left 4 Dead 2. This is quite an experience for someone who is used to console gaming.\n-Wireless is 802.11n and my laptop DOES have Bluetooth support. I picked my computer up when it jumped from $909 to $958, under the assumption that this model still didn't have Bluetooth, only to discover that I DO in fact have it. Perhaps that's why the bumped the price.\n-USB 3.0 port. I use it for my wireless mouse receiver right now, but it's nice to have a bit of future proofing here. I'll have USB 3.0 when devices start to use it.\n-Touchpad. I really like the touchpad on this laptop (I have an Asus netbook that has a similar pad). I turn off all functionality beyond 1 tap clicking, 2 finger scrolling, and 2 finger left click. Works great.\n-Dedicated volume buttons! About an inch above the F# keys, there are mute, volume down, and volume up buttons. They're a nice addition, I'd rather have them than have to use Fn + F10/11/12.\n-Number pad. Totally irrelevant to me, but probably useful to some folks. Might as well toss them in there, since the screen is so big.\n-Speaking of, THE SCREEN! It's gorgeous. I did some tinkering with it, at default settings the screen is a bit washed out, but the Win7 display calibrator got the job done, and everything looks right now.\n-All sorts of ports. Built in SD card slot, E-Sata, hdmi out, vga out, and two more USB 2.0 ports. More than enough for me!\n-The inner body is rubberized! Very nice to touch and rest my wrists on while typing. A really nice touch, in my opinion.\n-The speakers are actually quite decent. I rarely feel the desire to put on headphones while playing a game or watching something, the speakers can easily fill a small to medium sized room with a fan in the background. They beat the crap out of the wimpy speakers in my Macbook.\n\nCons:\n-Bloatware! I deleted a ton of stuff right off the bat, and I feel like I have more to delete. I had over 30 GB of space taken up on my HDD before I even used the laptop!\n-While playing a game like L4D2 or Portal, the fan on the left side of the laptop is an absolute heat wave. I had a bottle of Axe sitting next to the fan the first time I loaded up Portal, and after around a half hour of sitting in the fan's jetstream, the can was nearly scalding. I can deal with it (and to be honest, the heat could be worse considering the punch that this laptop packs), but just be aware of it. I no longer have anything sitting to the left of this laptop on my desk.\n-Battery life. Again, to be expected, but at max settings, Win7 tells me to expect between an hour and a half to two hours at full charge. I don't exactly travel with this though, so I'm over it.\n-Initial drive partitions. I have no idea why Asus likes to partition its laptop/netbook HDDs right off the bat, but they did the same thing with my netbook and now this laptop too. The C drive was set to 75 GB and the other drive was 200 something GB. I just merged the partitions back together with the built in Win7 tools, and now I'm back to one partition.\n\nI had my eye on desktop replacement laptops for about two months before I finally felt ok to pull the trigger on this one, and I don't regret my decision one bit. The only thing missing from this computer is a Blu Ray drive, but I felt that I wouldn't really use it much (I have a PS3). This laptop is every bit as good spec-wise as every other laptop in my price range (1000-1300), and it's sub $1000! I can't find a deal breaker here. If you have the money and want a reasonably priced desktop replacement laptop, this one should be near the top of your list.",

                "review_body": "I purchased this system for the dual purpose of gaming on-the-go, as well as having a mobile software development platform. As a college student, having my own system to tote around is far simpler than having to manage files on flash drives, uploading/downloading files, etc. I had been using an ASUS Eee 900 previously, but its processing power and hard drive space were quickly becoming limiting factors. I upgraded to this system at the beginning of October and have been very pleased. Being able to game between classes has been a plus as well.\n\nThose who obsess over playing games at the highest resolution with all settings at Ultra will be disappointed, but those people should know better than to be looking in this price range anyways. If you want to game with good framerates at something better than the lowest settings, you'll be pleased with this system. Running WoW, Starcraft II, TF2, BFBC2, and Mass Effect 2 at 1366*768 resolution with medium-to-high settings all produce capped framerates in normal situations and minimal framerate drops in more intense situations.\n\nOther notes in a few quick bullet points:\nPROS:\n- i7. They're so far ahead of anything else out there right now, buying anything that isn't an i3 or above seems almost like a waste of money.\n- Save for the lights on either side, fairly non-flashy case. Some might want the looks of the ASUS G-series. I like this as it's less of a target to be stolen and has a more professional look for use in the workplace.\n- Palm rests below the keyboard are rubberized. No more leaving palm imprints in cheap, coated plastic.\n- Numpad. Priceless when working in Excel during accounting courses. 0 key is slightly smaller to make room for the arrow keys, but you get used to it.\n- Does a very good job of keeping the system cool. The bottom of the case on the right side stays completely cool. The left side is slightly warm to the touch, but certainly still cool enough to place on your lap without it becoming uncomfortable. However, be aware of where you sit. If there's someone sitting to your left with their own computer, their mouse hand will get extremely hot as that is where your exhaust vent is.\n\nCONS:\n- Max screen resolution of 1366*768. Not an overly big deal for most productivity applications, but fonts can sometimes get squished in games.\n- Battery life. Don't expect to be gaming for hours without a power source nearby. Using the power options, turning down screen brightness, shutting off WiFi, and only running essential apps, I can get it to last through 2 hour lectures, but that's pushing it. Playing games unplugged will give you lower framerates than when on AC power, and will drain your battery dry in a matter of 30-40 minutes.\n- The two lights on the side. They're bright in a dark room, and they blink when the computer is put to sleep. If you're going to be keeping this in a bedroom, plan to shut it down at night.\n- Touchpad is just barely in position to be in contact with your left palm at homerow position. Non-issue for me, personally, since I shut off the touchpad and plug in a mouse. The Elantech software has a feature to detect and ignore input when it's your palm, but seems to need configuring and I haven't done so due to using a mouse.\n- Bloatware. You're not gonna find a computer from a manufacturer these days without it, though, so this is no surprise. ASUS's software tends to be more in the \"I don't need it\"\" category than the \"\"I don't want it",

                "review_body": "Pros:\n-very light and portable\n-very quiet (fans automatically adjust depending on system temp)\n-good set of speakers in it (they get pretty loud and still maintain clear sound\n-multi-touch track pad works well\n-facial recognition works well\n-HDMI out is amazing, I use it to connect to my tv\n-the screen is very clear and there are shortcut keys on the keyboard to adjust the brightness\n-laptop is fast with the Intel i5, 4gb of RAM, and the HD 5470\n-battery life is around 3.5 hours which is pretty good considering the hardware you are running off a 6-cell battery\n-keyboard has plenty of shortcut keys (volume, brightness, media controls, wifi toggle, HMDI toggle, camera, battery mode)\n-comes with a 2 year warranty and a 1 year accidental warranty\n\nCons:\n-microphone isn't very good\n-keyboard has a little too much flex (it takes time to get used to, doesn't really seem to bother me that much anymore)\n-disk drive is tray style, slot style would be much better\n-only one audio port which means you need an external sound card in order to use 5.1 surround sound speakers\n\nOverall its a very good laptop with a few minor flaws. For the price you cannot beat it, I tried building a similar laptop with Dell and Lenovo and both came out to around $1000. This laptop is great if you need a portable laptop that is also large enough to be used as a desktop replacement. It has a lot of great features packed into it and I would definitely recommend this laptop.",

After taking 5-6 minutes to boot (my Core i3 laptop takes 45 seconds by contrast) I checked for errors.  The hard disk showed up in the system log as having numerous problems.  I thought it may have been a virus issue but Norton and Malwarebytes said otherwise.  I sent the unit back to Asus where they replaced the hard disk and reimaged the unit - now its worst off then before.  Unfortunately it takes over an hour each time I call to try and get an RMA.  I've had lots of laptops and this one is the worst one ever.  Poor quality, slow service, long repair times, and no replacement possible.  Next time I'll get an HP or a Toshiba.",

HDMI connection to the TV also have issues, on both laptops, i have constant restarts when hdmi connection is plugged in. there is no keyboard backlight and mouse pad pattern bothers me. the major con is battery life; it went downfrom 2 hrs to 50 min in 6 months. you need to carry ac adapter with you all the time. overall design is poor.",

They requested that I contact Amazon since it was only 48 hours since I received the computer. I contacted Amazon via the internet on a Thursday night, and received a replacement on Saturday morning! This one works well. It is speedy, and comfortable, small enough to tote and large enough to see. The only complaint is that the keyboard feels a bit flimsy, although it is not. Also, for a laptop with everything- no blue-tooth. That being said,it is a wondrous combination; A good computer, and a great vendor.",

As long as you aren't an extreme gamer, this system will work for you.\n\nThe Asus K42jr-a1 runs very smooth and can handle everything I have thrown at it.  I used the recovery partition to reinstall on a single partition, but I have heard of just doing a fresh install.  This also works.  As with many laptops these days, lots of bloatware, but I was aware of this, and cleaned out what I didn't want.  If you are a little weary fully deleting programs (even though you have the utility disk), just deactivate the services and stop certain programs from starting at the boot.  This will also increase your performance.\n\n****NOTE:  When the computer was first booted, it seemed very sluggish.  At times, the cpu light was on, but it appeared nothing was happening.  Task Manager showed no CPU activity.  After a couple minutes, the computer would resume what it was working on.  But, this freezing, or sluggish activity would occur every 5 minutes or so. After some research, I found this obscure, but simple solution.  From (...)\n\n\"Start",

The thought of adapting to Windows 7, Office 2007 and new hardware besides was daunting.\n\nI couldn't be happier! Windows 7 is a dream and the laptop itself is really an easy machine to work with and no idiosyncracies.  The price was a complete bargain!  I did my market research and ASUS was listed as the best buy for the money, but I didn't expect to be so happy!  I had heard that the touch pad and keyboard were not responsive and that people had trouble using the camera, etc because the instructions weren't included.  I found everything simple to use and intuitive.  I would highly reccomend this computer to everyone, not just the budget conscious.",

So far I have no comments on longevity (bought it at the end of June), but it is working well after a month.  I enjoy using it, and given the price differential ($600 vs. $2,000 between it and a more expensive model), this seems to have all that I need. I'm in the real estate and lending business, so I don't need a gaming computer, so it seems perfectly adequate. One complaint: Asus sets up its drive partitioned into a System Drive (C:) and a Data Drive (D:); however, Win7 wants to put \"My Documents",

I purchased one of these and within 3 months was having lots of power supply/charging issues. Asus' response was to update the drivers, which were already up to date. So within 3 months of that, the computer literally fried and went up in smoke. Yes, it is under warranty, and the long warranty they offer is great. Unless you actually have to use it. It has been a full 28 days right now since Asus has been working on my laptop. I have spent hours on the phone with them trying to get a status. The concept of a supervisor doesn't exist there. They are more than happy to set the phone down for a half hour and come back later to see if you are still there. So my nearly new computer is still sitting in their repair facility almost a month later. So consider yourself warned. Take these reviews that mention the reliability and customer support to heart and save yourself the trouble and look elsewhere.\n\nThe screen is big and looks great. I will give it that much. But it means nothing when the entire machine goes up in smoke and the manufacturer doesn't even seem to know how to fix it. And no, they won't just ship a replacement.",

It may not be the right computer for everyone but if you are looking for a laptop that comes with an i7 processor there was no way to beat the price.  When I was able to get a computer that was originally $1200 for $899 I had to jump at the opportunity.  The computer is big and not for easy transportation but if you use it instead of having a desktop I highly recommend it.  I will say that if it would have been full price when I purchased it, I wouldn't have bought it but if you can pick up this computer for under $1000 you can't go wrong.  It is a very good gaming computer, not top of the line mind you but it runs games like Dragon Age and Mass Effect 2 at their highest settings.  The screen is beautiful and has a very large display.  I do agree with one negative review about the zero key on the number pad isn't full which has thrown me off on a couple of occasions but it is barely worth mentioning.\n  Overall, I would buy this computer again at this price point without hesitation.",

Everything was good on this thing but the speakers did get a little fritzy if it was too loud. Gets hot a little. THIS THING HAS A WEIRD THING WHERE THE CPU LOOKS LIKE IT ISNT ENOUGH but it lies...it adds to it with something else...ITS HUGE so dont think its going with you to the park. It has a huge range for wifi. It has a little problem with the usb...its right where you would have the mouse...yeah...but over then that. THIS IS THE BEST COMPUTER I HAVE EVER HAD. try to find a laptop case in stores before you buy one online to make sure that they fit...it is long. screen was awesome graphics were awesome. . . nothing more to say about it really. It was flashy, expensive, and beautiful...curse you who rob others i would have enjoyed this if i got to keep it past three months.\n\nEDITED: I bought the same computer with the insurance...and just one quick thing BUY LOJACK FOR LAPTOPS OR SOME KIND OF retrieving software. This computer a year has never caused me a problem. It boots up perfectly. One thing I noticed though and there is no other way but to do it manually, the things downloaded automatically save to the operating system...manually save them to the hard drive or you will be annoyed by the OS saying it is full after only a few gigs. Does get quite hot on one side so dont put anything on the left side of it other then the wires.",

The video camera has stopped working and the touch pad has wear in the center but it still works. I've reloaded the OS a few times, it takes for-ever for all the Microsoft updates to complete, don't do the optional updates, you're just asking for trouble.

                "review_body": "The reviews prior to this one say what a great laptop this is but that it lacked a Blu-Ray player.  The description must have been off when most people first ordered this, and I would be upset if I had thought I was getting blu-ray player, but didn't.  That being said, and I knew what I was getting.  Let me be clear; this is an AMAZING value for what you're getting...even without Blu-Ray.  Think about it; you're getting an Intel Core i7 laptop, with a 1GB ATI discrete graphics card, 17 inch, high def screen, and a 500GB hard-drive...oh and 4GB of Kingston RAM...all for under $1200 (as of this writing)?  Are you kidding me?\n\nI love this laptop, and I was a lifelong HP guy, until my screen died after 2 years of use...the build quality on this is incredible, the screen is beautiful, and as for Blu-Ray...meh.  Everything's going disc-less digital anyway.  A few years from now, and everything will be download only anyway.\n\nDon't let the other reviews fool you, this is THE value in laptops, from one of the most well-decorated manufacturers of the last few years.  Check out some sites on the net, do your research, and I'm sure you'll come to the same conclusion I did...this is the laptop to own.\n\nGood luck and happy hunting.\n\nADDITIONAL INFO (Posted 3/22/2010) after using this laptop for the past few days, I can safely say that this was a great bargain.  It's faster and more responsive than my previous HP that cost 3x as much.  Also, it came with DDR3 1333 RAM instead of the advertised 1066.  Nice little bonus.  Point being, if you buy this laptop, I doubt you'd ever regret it.",

Thanks to Dell's Lojack service, the police came to my house with a search warrant and confiscated the Latitude after I would not return the detective's phone calls.  (I wonder why they didn't find the Latitude from the guy who sold it to me??) Anyway, if you own a Dell, the Lojack service does work.  After this experience, do you think I would buy another Dell?  -NOT ON YOUR LIFE.  The police treated me like a common criminal, indicated that they thought I stole the laptop, and trashed my house. The 5 police officers who raided my home were not interested in helping me recover the $$$ I paid for the 830.\n\nAt any rate, I decided it was time to bite the bullet and buy new, unstolen, and get a warranty.  After researching Tom's Hardware, Newegg, Amazon, Laptop review and others I settled on Asus with the i7 processor.  I intended to buy the N61 and save $100, but finally decided the 17\" screen was worth the extra money.  The Egg people still had the N71 when I ordered",

Best config available when I bought with a awesome price.\nAfter the first month I've realized it can't be used as a laptop. Seriously, I got my lap literally burned. It is extremely hot.\nI've treated it as my personal treasure, since I got it after saving for a LONG LONG time and after 1 months after warranty experied it went dead.\nCan you guys imagine how frustrating this can be? I'm on the last semester of a engineering school and I rely on my computer for pretty much everything. I have to write an article or else I can't graduate.\nThe best part is, since I don't live in the USA, I relative of mine took it here to Brazil and one of the features that led me to buy it was its 1 year international warranty. They do have technical support in Brazil, but it's only in one place which is over 2 thousand miles aways from here.\nNow, I'm stucked with this piece of garbage, I can't afford another notebook, and they think I'm a stupid third world country costumer.\nI promise you guys I'm gonna be posting lots of videos on how bad this ASUS is.\n\nAdvice?

                "review_body": "The HDMI port was loose and could not maintain a connection with my HDTV.  (Yes, I did try other cables, all of which worked with other components.)  I mean the port itself wiggled a bit---not the cable in the port.  Typing anything or just touching the touchpad knocked out the connection to the TV.\n\nIf you look at how the port is placed, jammed under the ExpressCard slot, you will see that such a problem is not surprising.  I didn't think about it before buying, though I did see a photo showing the layout.\n\nAlso, prospective buyers should note that, despite the ATI 5730's abilities, this laptop does not output 1080p to a TV---even with the latest ATI driver update.\n\nI only had the computer about 36 hours, but I always test as much as I can as soon as I can.  In most other aspects, I'd give this computer high ratings.  The only longterm worry would be heat management, as there doesn't seem to be a lot of venting space for such a hot CPU.  Reading reviews, I always though people were joking about keeping coffee warm by placing a cup next to the exhaust vent.  Really works with this unit!\n\nThe keyboard is spongy in the center.\n\nNow for the good:\n\nOne reviewer complained about the glare.  Personally, I think it is less of a problem than on many units.  Mine came with a protective sheet of what was either real glass or extremely hard plexiglass over the LCD screen, something that adds strength to the display and upper part of the unit.  I liked it a lot.\n\nSound is very, very good.  This includes the built in microphone!  I actually got the Windows 7 Speech Recognition to work pretty well in just a couple of hours.\n\nThe webcam is ok with color and clarity.  In very bright light the typical built-in webcam lag is not too bad.\n\nBattery life was almost three hours, which is amazing considering the battery only has six cells and powers a quad-core.\n\nThe keypad is an Elan, and it was smooth, precise, and responsive.\n\nFast Seagate HDD.  Atheros wireless that worked very well in public and with my own wireless router.\n\nThe recovery disk creation process was as smooth as any I've seen, taking about two hours and requiring five blank DVD's.\n\nI thought this was going to be my baby for the next five or six years.  The bad HDMI port, which, true, could happen on any machine, seemed as much a result of engineering as assembly problems, so I'm going to get something else.  The other reason I won't get this one again is it only outputs up to 720p to an HDTV.  Much cheaper laptops with ATI GPU's do put out the full 1080p.\n\nThe spongy keyboard was disappointing also.\n\nI've had an Asus laptop for seven years; it has been very reliable, so I will very likely stick with this brand---but I'll look harder at how the ports are arranged.",

                "review_body": "I have had this laptop for several months now, and I must say I love it. It took me a long time to even consider buying a laptop since they simply do not have the capacity of desktop computers. However, after owning this ASUS K52 I have become a believer. The layout is great, the design is sleek, and the performance is above my expectations.\n\nLayout and Design: The layout of the laptop is great. The keyboard design is large and spacious enough that my fat fingers do not make the typos I typically make on other, smaller, designs. It also has a full numpad, which is a feature I truly hate not having available. The screen size is plenty big enough to browse the internet, write papers, and/or play games with ease. It is also a sleek and cosmetically pleasing design with rounded edges and corners.\n\nPerformance: Now on to the most important aspect of any computer, its performance. I have been able to run any game I have desired to play (Oblivion, Fallout 3, Star Wars The Old Republic) on medium to high settings without much in the way of slow down and frame rate issues. I haven't had any problems with the hardware malfunctioning through all the use I put this thing through. It boots fast, and it plays fast. I also use this computer for all of my many school papers, payments online, and pretty much everything you can use a computer for these days. It has never failed me and continues to perform today as it did the first day I received it.\n\nConclusion: Overall, it's a great piece of machinery. I love it. It serves all of the purposes I have had for it. There are more pricey laptops out there with a bit more power under the hood, but I have found this one to have plenty to run all the games I love and to quickly and reliably completely all the other tasks I have had for it.",

                "review_body": "I have had this product for two years now. In fact, my two year warranty ran out four days ago. However, I am having hardware failures for the third time since my purchase.\n\nI work in IT and take very good care of this notebook. It never leaves my desk unless I am travelling and I am careful to keep the notebook safe while travelling. I keep my computer free of viruses and malware and regularly clean it with CCleaner and a disk defrag. However, one year after my purchase my hard drive was the first piece of hardware to fail me. I sent in my notebook and two weeks later received my notebook with a new HDD.\n\nA few months ago, my notebook started failing again until it finally would not boot at all. I sent it in and again they fixed my issues and sent me back my new notebook. However, they only replaced the motherboard and the back of the laptop and did not fix the cracked casing around my screen or the dead pixels on my screen like I had requested.\n\nNow, four days after my warranty has run out, my battery has stopped charging and my computer will not turn on unless it is plugged in. This is generally fine for me although it is an inconvenience. However, my HDD also seems to be failing as it has started making clicking noises that are a sign of it failing and documents have been taking far to long to pull up. I contacted Asus support and even though my warranty so recently ran out and I've already had to send in my notebook twice for issues that never should have happened in the first place, they refuse to provide me with service.\n\nIn short I do not recommend this notebook to anyone looking for a quality PC. The parts must be terrible quality to fail so quickly and the customer service I've received has been terrible in comparison to any other company I've ever dealt with.",

                "review_body": "I had been researching laptops for more than a year before I bought this one. After buying my son an ASUS UL50VT for Christmas after extensive research, I was hooked on ASUS. Good reviews, nice design, good performance. My laptop needs are viewing movies and shows, heavy surfing, downloading and burning, playing music, and light gaming. This is perfect for my needs.\n\nThe first thing I noticed about this one is the keyboard; it is a 'chiclet design' with wider caps which make it extremely comfortable for typing. A lot less errors on my part. The ELAN touchpad (smartpad) is super. For the last year, I have borrowed a friend's ACER and his touchpad drives me crazy. It zooms, the cursor moves and jumps about all the time, frustrating me to no end; I finally had to disable it completely. With this computer, palm detection notes the difference between the palm and a finger so that the cursor doesn't jump around while typing. You can also do pinch and zoom. The large palm rest area is supercomfortable as well and minimizes smudges, unlike the rubbery type ones you see which I hate.\n\nI like the Power4Gear which allows you to select your desired processor mode to conserve battery life and have fan power adjusted. Very handy. The Intel I3 Core is more than enough for my needs, lightening fast, and the NVIDEA GEFORCE 310M graphics is excellent for the light gaming that I do.\n\nThe sunken hinges enhance viewing by providing a wider more comfortable and less distracting viewing experience, as well as making the laptop look much more visually appealing and sleek. The sound is great (SRS with ALTEC lansing speakers) for media and music. The computer is really sleek and cool looking and my son prefers it to the design of his.\n\nThe first thing that I didn't like is the screen brightness; unless I have it on full brightness, I can't see it. It seems to be dimmer than others I have used, even on full brightness, but maybe it's my imagination? I had it side by side my friend's ACER, with the annoying touchpad, and my son's ASUS UL50VT and both of their screens appeared brighter.\n\nMy major disappointment is the battery life, despite a little sticker on the computer that states 'great battery power' or something like that. With screen brightness mid range and just using it for moderate surfing and office applications, the battery only lasts two hours. I had expected more. Another annoying thing is the frequent disappearance of the power icon in the taskbar; the setting to turn it on in the taskbar is greyed out. After googling some forums, I followed the recommendation, logged off and back on. Bingo, the power icon was back. But since the battery life is a disappointment, I don't want to be fiddling around trying to see the power icon to have notice of when it will die.\n\nConclusion: excellent value. Biggest PRO: other than the speed of I3 (and it is really really fast), it would be the touchpad and keyboard. Biggest CON: battery life.",

I loaded no additional software and had saved about 1/2 dozen photos and a couple of small text documents (fortunately all backed up elsewhere). Turned it on June 26, 2010 and got weird screen about no hard drive.  Called son who is software engineer and he said yeah mom, call Asus.  I've shipped it back at my expense, they'll email me with the cost to fix it, and send it back at their cost whether I chose to pay for them to fix it or not.",

                "review_body": "After doing quite a bit of research, I decided to purchase this Netbook.  This is even after highly considering the PU17 which as mentioned earlier comes with a recovery disk but not the nice matte soft touch exterior.  The reason this specific model does not come with a recovery disk is because there is one-touch recovery built in which will restore the PC to its original state from files which are located on the hard drive.  From my understanding, people better start getting used to this since it seems to be where every manufacturer is going.  I also chose to install Windows 7 Ultimate 32-bit instead of sticking with the Starter Edition (see ya later bloatware!!!) which runs very very well on only 1GB of RAM.  I have the 2GB upgrade coming this week (just make sure you get a RAM with CL=5).  The reason I didn't install 64-bit is because you can't use more than 2GB of memory and also because I didn't want to have any driver issues.  In the end, it makes very little difference.  So far it seems that Win7 Ultimate even runs better and smoother than the Starter version, mostly due to the removal of all the crapware that comes pre-installed.\n\nCouple of things to note:  I installed the new OS using a bootable flash drive due to the lack of a CD/DVD Rom Drive (You can make any basic flash drive bootable).  Also, when I was installing the new OS, there were 4 partitions on the HDD.  Two of the partitions were your basic space allocated to storing installed programs/data storage etc, however, there was also 10GB and 17MB partitions which from my understanding contain recovery files.  To be safe, just leave these partitions alone.\n\nAll in all, I am very happy with this Netbook and am glad I purchased it.\n\nP.S. - BOO to all the people giving negative reviews because of their own ignorance!  Ex: The description clearly states that there is no Recovery DVD included in the box!  Do your homework people!\n\nP.P.S. - Google is your friend!",

If this had the 64MB dedicated DDR3 Graphics memory, Ion and Broadcom graphics and HD chips, matte surface LCD, matte surface keyboard surround, 1.3MP Webcam and retained the 14 Hour maximum battery life, and the Right Shift key off the 1000HE keyboard, it would be darned near perfect.  But at $339.22 with 2 day shipping, compared to the 1005PE-PU17-BK with its fingerprint-magnet surfaces and usual $364 On-line price, this is a fabulous bargain.",

I am finishing up my masters online, so I needed something that was compact and easy to travel with. It easily fits into my purse and the battery life is insane. When just working on papers and doing light surfing I can get almost 10 hours, and I don't have a tv, so I can stream about 7 hours worth of video without having to plug it in. The biggest con is that the Windows 7 starter is extremely basic. I didn't add any extra memory to it, and I have Office 2010 professional with all of the bells and whistles and it works fine. Skype seems to take a while to load on it for some reason. I don't download tons of music, videos, or pictures, so maybe I would need to add more memory, but for my purposes of school, surfing the net, and watching videos online it's perfect. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a netbook, it really gets the job done and works wonderfully!",

Connecting with a bluetooth mouse also needs extra effort. I paid more for its bluetooth feature, but so bad I can't use it. Called their customer service, but they said that's the problem of the other end, so I have to call the manufacturer of my other bluetooth devices -- a PC company, a cell phone company, a mouse company etc. to find the answer. Frustrated and disappointed!\n\nOther than that, the touchpad doesn't work so well as expected.",

I can just imagine how much difficulties I would have endured if instead I'm lugging my laptop. No problem connecting with Wifi's. The problem is when only a broadband exists as it happened in some places; I wish I know how to connect with it (the broadband).\n\nI charge the battery full each time but the indicator fluctuates between 8-10 hours. No 14-hour battery life as advertized. Also, I doubt if the indicated hours is reality-based because I noticed sometimes that the charge goes out faster than its indicated content. It's okay with routine works but sometimes more juice is needed and there's nowhere to recharge. Is Asus willing to accept a return for exhange or is the same kind of battery available and affordable to purchase? By the way, I have not added memory or anything to the item.\n\nAnother gripe: In using Works/Wordpad/Notepad for wordprocessing, the cursor has a way of jumping all over the place (indiscriminately) without intent on my part such that inputting a text in a sentence in one place would suddenly have its continuation written in another place on the same page.",

                "review_body": "I just paid $340 for this netbook, and it was well worth the money. I bought it for my wife to use around the house, and to take with her to class. Once she got used to using the smaller 'laptop' she loves it. I did all the research I could and came down to the fact that this was the best buy. The build quality, features (including Bluetooth!), low heat output, and excellent battery life I've seen on it so far make me feel like I could've paid $400 for it.\n\nThe first thing I did was try a recovery using the hidden partition. You basically don't need any CD like the one review complained about. The recovery partition acts as your restore cd. The 3 step directions are in the short user manual on how to use it. I restored it to factory settings in about 15 minutes, just to try it out.\n\nNext thing I did was clean up all the extra add-on softare. There's plenty to remove so try out everything first, then decide what you can remove to free up some resources.\n\nAnother intersting feature is the 'instant on' feature. It's like another power button, but boots right into a menu that will open a basic web browser and let you get on the internet, all without ever having to wait to boot into Windows. I could see her using it to quickly jump on and look up something.\n\nAdding another 1GB of RAM would probably be nice, but she's not crunching anything intensive on this thing to make it worthwhile. If you're doing a lot of multi-tasking you probably want a beefier laptop anyway. Maybe down the road when the RAM is $20 we'll throw it in, but she's only doing one or two things at a time anyway.\n\nI'm an IT professional and would recommend this over anything else right now to those looking for a netbook. You won't find anything else that compares at this price range.",

I have already upgraded to Windows 7 Ultimate, which seems to be faster than the pre-installed Windows 7 Basic, but I imagine that is because I didn't put back on every piece of Asus software.  It's even running the AERO theme on 1GB of memory; 2GB upgrade is on its way.  To comment on the other review which mentioned there is no recovery disc, that is true, and is the only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5.  But knowing this ahead of time would NOT have changed my purchase.  Until I read the other review, I actually thought they may have just left my disc out.  Good to know it wasn't just mine and sounds like a recovery disc isn't included with this model.  Most recent versions of utilities and drivers are easily found on Asus's website.  And as far as being able to reinstall Windows 7 Basic, there is a 10GB hidden partition (which is mostly full) on the hard drive that holds all the necessary files to return the netbook back to its original state.  I have not personally tried this, but have read multiple sources online stating that is what this partition is for.  I have only used this for 3 days now, but so far very satisfied.\n\nOne last note, the matte cover is nice, but the screen frame and area below the keyboard is still a finger print magnet.",

Unfortunately, once it was charged up and ready to go, we found that the internet barely connected anywhere in our house.  Even standing right in front of the wireless router, I only got 3 out of 5 bars of connectivity.  I restarted both the netbook and the router, checked for bios updates and uninstalled and reinstalled the driver software.  All the while, our laptop computer connected to the internet with full coverage and no problems.\nNothing worked for the netbook, so I called up the Asus help line to see what they could recommend.  Both me and the guy I spoke with on the other line had a hard time understanding each other because of a language barrier and I think this may have contributed to the frustration.  He told me there was nothing wrong with my netbook and that I needed to be standing within 5-10 feet of the router for the connection to work.  I explained that this was absurd and that I wanted to send it back for one that worked.  Needless to say, the conversation ended badly.  Luckily, Amazon allowed me to return it anyway.  As always, they have the best return policy.  As I told the fellow on the phone, I won't purchase anything from Asus any longer, but I will definitely get my next netbook from Amazon.",

The battery is truly long-lasting (if you use the wireless card sparingly and don't set the screen at its brightest setting). I have an earlier Eee PC netbook model that this netbook is replacing, and I want to point out that it was very clear to me that ASUS have been listening to user feedback: They have improved the design from previous netbooks substantially. The screen is just a tad bigger than in previous models, and it is just big enough as to not be annoying. I think that at 10.1 inches they have found the optimal screen size for a netbook. Very importantly, the keyboard has been much improved. In previous netbooks, the small keys took some getting used to and even then were difficult to use and created strain. ASUS have resolved this issue by making the netbook slightly bigger and leaving space between the keys of the keyboard. This results in very intuitive typing, essentially no wrong hits, and an easy use - no worse than any laptop-type computer. In fact, I actually like the keyboard, even though I did not get a netbook with the intention to use it for much typing. In addition, ASUS have changed the keyboard layout slightly and have resolved some issues that their previous models had - for example, the PageUp and PageDown keys are now easy to use because they have positioned an Fn key right next to them. These little improvements have resolved my discontents with previous netbooks. The only thing that remains slightly annoying is the metallic sound of the speakers; obviously, one wouldn't buy a netbook for its speaker quality, but I was surprised that the speakers have not improved a bit from previous models. The solution for me is to use a pair of good earbud phones instead of the speakers. Good job, ASUS. My main point of discontent is the choice to sell this with Windows 7 Starter instead of XP or 7 Home; this is mostly Microsoft's fault, not ASUS's, but I have to agree with other reviewers that Starter is an annoying interface. Windows Home is a very marginal improvement from 7 and is not worth the money, so I understand why ASUS would sell this with Starter; furthermore, Windows 7 is a stable and fast system. Nevertheless, its limitations in terms of being able to customize the appearance of the graphic user interface are inappropriate for a netbook. In a netbook, one needs to be able to get rid of unnecessary embellishments to the interface that take up screen space, because the screen space is limited. Windows 7 Starter is limited in this regard, on purpose, by Microsoft, so that you would spend money on Windows Home, and this makes me angry. It's not even the inconvenience that is the problem, it's the evil-hearted marketing decision by Microsoft that embitters me toward Microsoft and, by association, toward Asus. In summary, this is a great netbook, and it is obvious that ASUS have been listening to customers and making slight but valuable improvements to their netbooks that have resulted in this fine product. Windows 7 Starter spoils it enough to take off a star.",

I turned it on and was surprised by how slow this 1005PE was compared to the 2G surf.  I thought, this is an upgrade???  Of course, I hadn't yet implemented Turtle James's recommendations.  If you hadn't read his review, it would be well worth your time.\n\nThe things that improved performance:\n\n1)  Speed noticeably increased when I got rid of WebStorage.\n\n2)  Speed improved with upgrade to 2 GB RAM.\n\n3)  More improvement using ReadyBoost.\n\n4)  Started using Firefox and surfing has never been better.\n\nNow, my 1005PE is no longer sluggish, thanks to Turtle James.\n\nINSTANT BOOT\n\nInstead of booting the regular way, there is a button for instant boot, which is exactly as it says.  This is supposed to be a quick on for the system to do things like web, photos, Skype.  Of course, not everything boots up.  I cannot use my USB modem.  Only WiFi or wired internet access is possible.\n\nThe instant boot screen is very slow and unresponsive.  For something that is supposed to be quick, it is very sluggish.  I'd rather boot the old fashioned way and get the most out of my computer.\n\nOTHER THAN SPEED\n\nOf the aesthetic details, the cover is rubbery.  I'm not sure how much I like that.  At least I can grip it easily.  The inside is glossy and a fingerprint magnet.\n\nThe touchpad works but takes a little getting used to.  I found it worked better after I went into the control panel to tweak it.  Still I prefer using a mouse.\n\nThe screen is beautiful.  No complaints there.\n\nThe sound is not great.  Sounds like a small computer, but it is a small computer so I'm not disappointed.  I'm not planning on using this as my music player.\n\nThe computer runs cool, even when I've had it on for hours.  My 2G Surf would heat up.  The 1005PE gets a little warm, but not noticeably so.  I could hold it in my lap without being uncomfortable.\n\nI can usually get about 10 hours before the computer dies out on me.  It's a remarkable battery life, considering what I had on my 2G Surf.\n\nI mostly do web surfing on the netbook and for that, Windows 7 Starter has been all that I need.  I haven't seen any reason to upgrade.\n\nI like being able to restore the system with a touch of a button.  No need to save and then hunt for that recovery disc.\n\nPROS:\n+ runs well once the system is tweaked\n+ small, lightweight and portable\n+ cover is rubbery, resists fingerprints and provides grip\n+ beautiful screen\n+ netbook doesn't get hot\n+ long battery life\n+ no need for recovery disc\n\nCONS:\n- must upgrade and tweak before using\n- inside panels are glossy fingerprint magnets\n- sound is weak\n- Instant Boot is slow and unresponsive\n- Instant Boot will not accept USB modem\n\nOverall, I consider this a great buy, but only after all the tweaking.  If I wanted something to work right out of the box, I would have been disappointed; because it would have been far too sluggish.",

The monitor is bright and shows photos very well, very important for me because processing the photos I take is one of the major uses.  The ability to tilt the monitor to the position you prefer helps in this regard.  The 2-year global warranty and the 1-year accidental damage warranty are pluses and indicate the confidence that ASUS has in the quality of their computers.\n\nUpdate:  I have used the computer now for a month and am still very enthused.  I have edited 100s of photos during this period and pleased with the monitors performance.\n\nA techie friend was who suggested this might be the computer for me, when I told him my requirements.  He said if he were in the market for a new laptop, this is one he would buy.\n\nI am still amazed how fast this computer is compared to my previous computer.

I will try to keep it free of crappy software and I hope it lasts a long time.\n\nConstruction is plastic, but is solid. There is some keyboard flex in the S,D,E key neighborhood. The arrow keys are a bit small and weirdly positioned, the right shift is smaller than the left shift. There is a number keypad, which is nice, but I don't use it. The screen is pretty and glossy (could be good or bad thing, depending on what you do). The webcam works well, but it's only VGA. Speakers are decent, given that it's a laptop, but my definition of decent may differ from yours.\n\nOne of the cheapest laptops out there with Core i5 and 1Gb of dedicated video memory + 4Gb RAM + 500Gb drive. It's not compact, but it's not bulky either. Beats the hell out of my old Toshiba Satellite A15 that I had in college. Laptops have come a long way in the past few years.\n\nI hope this helps.",

I did.  Well it kept doing the same thing and then it just would not rebut.  Just a solid gray screen it was fried.  I called the tech. who, once again had me reinstall the OS which took over an hour this time.  And, of course, I had to reload my printer etc.  Well, it went black again, shut itself off.  I called Asus and said I want to replace it with another.  They said they don't do that.  Now, mind you, it shut itself down everyday I used the thing.  So I called Amazon and they had UPS pick it up today and I am getting another laptop which won't be an Asus.  Now maybe it was just a lemon, who knows, but Asus should have made it good plus given me a tech I could understand.",

Some heat produced, but I can work comfortably with it sitting on my lap.\nThe case, including the navigation pad is slightly patterned - looks nice, has a good solid feel, minimal fingerprints.\nThe keyboard has a lot of flex, which bothered meet initially.  But I've looked at some other ASUS laptops in the store, they all seem to have a fair amount of flex - maybe it's made that way in case you're banging hard on the keys.  The chiclet keys themselves have a good feel and are well spaced - full numeric keyboard on the side is a plus.\nBattery usage can be adjusted - I would say 2 1/2 hours battery time in the performance mode.\nIncluded utilities may or may not be useful, not too much other included software - get rid of the Trend AV package, Norton 360 works well.\nOverall - very happy with the purchase.",

                "review_body": "This netbook has a great feature set and works well, despite a few niggling flaws.\n\nPROS: Bright, full resolution screen, great battery life, HD accelerator, bluetooth, smudge-free case, kinda decent speakers, nice touchpad, very light.\n\nCONS: Noisy keyboard, keyboard flex, takes some tweaking to get the Broadcom card to work well, bad speaker placement (under the front), stiff trackpad button.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\nOther users complain about bloatware and there really isn't all that much.  And like any new computer, it takes awhile to configure it.  I also added an SD card for a little ReadyBoost speed bump and will add another gig of RAM, but when it's in Super Performance mode, it does everything with minimal, if any, hesitation.  I'm hoping the extra RAM will speed things up.\n\nI bought this mostly as a media player and it does that well.  480 Hulu can be twitchy at times but Netflix and Youtube play very well.  It's my first time using Windows 7 Starter and so far I haven't found a real need to upgrade.\n\nThe battery lasts for well over 8 hours, which is fantastic.  They keyboard is noisy and flimsy but I can type fairly quickly with it.  Frankly, with the video accelerator and the full screen resolution, it's the netbook I wanted at a very reasonable price.  I can live with its few shortcomings.",

So the processor cannot handle smooth playback. The cpu usage was at a whopping 100% when trying to play the 1080p vid.\n\nThen again, the screen is so small that 480p is amazing already.\n\nLike some others, I don't like the highly reflective screen, but I understand why a matte screen like the 1005PE wasn't used. The pixels are so small that a matte finish would actually distort the light from the tiny pixels.\n\nOn the advice of others I immediately upgraded to a 2gb RAM, so I can't say if it's made a difference or not.\n\nOverall, this lil' guy fits the bill for me for internet browsing, skype, and writing papers.",

The ensuing struggle with ASUS's phone support to get an RMA was so monumentally horrible that it poisoned me against the ASUS brand permanently. (I had to postpone a trip to the States, so, sadly, I fell out of Amazon's 30-day warranty window.) Here's the message I left ASUS on my customer satisfaction survey:\n\nDealing with ASUS phone support was so unpleasant that, while I think ASUS products are generally of very high quality and have built two pcs with ASUS motherboards and other components, I will never purchase another ASUS product. I bought an ASUS Eee PC 1005PR-PU17-BK that did not have a functioning Broadcom HD chipset. This problem was widespread and well documented by other purchasers on the Amazon and Newegg websites. Amazon even pulled the netbook off its site for a time because of the problem. Regardless, ASUS's phone support reps seemed to have zero knowledge of this, and they did everything they could, including twisting truth into a pretzel, to avoid giving me an RMA. Good going, ASUS. Your phone support is cutting off your customer loyalty at the knees.",

I was very disappointed because if you have to play just the .m2ts you lose the chapters and more importantly any of the forced subs. I all ready own the TMT Extreme and thought I would install it. It plays the movie from the BD folder and also has sound BUT the video playback is not fluid at all, It jerks and studders all over the place. I finally had to do a full F9 reinstall to get the old version TMT3 back to working. What a rip off if they try to sell us an upgrade for 99 bucks. I think that the ASUS 1005PR is a great idea but I am already out 425 dollars for it, plus 80 dollars for 2Gigs of ram (what a rip off cause they should have put it in or at least offered it as upgrade since it is painfully slow with out it and after upgrade you are left with a useless 1Gig stick.), so for 500 dollars I might as well wait till some one else offers a comparable net book that will play real HD content. Arcsoft did this same old crap with the Hauppauge HD PVR 1212. It came with TMT but was crippled with no way to edit the files untill you paid more.

It also slugged through 50 minutes of battery life. This computer, however, charges very fast and stays charged for 10-12 hours. Even after 9 months, I'm still getting 8-9 hours out of this. It runs cool, runs long, and never crashes.\n\nMy only complaint is in the actual structure of the computer. Why can't ASUS sell a \"premier\"\" line of netbooks made from aluminum that don't feel so cheap? Seriously",

                "review_body": "First let me say that the netbook looks great and is really light. Even with a padded sleeve, this takes up much less room in my bag and is really light.\n\nI read other reviews where fingerprint smudges were mentioned. This definitely happens, and because it's so shiny the smudges are obvious, but they easily wipe off.\n\nBeyond the appearance, the keyboard is nice - actual raised keys that are satisfying to touch. Unfortunately, on a couple of occasions, the keys did not seem to catch up with me as I typed (I type quite quickly) and that meant that I had to go back and revise many words that were misspelled. I like the mouse touchpad and buttons (actually one button with two sides - nice), but it takes a little getting used to.\nThe screen is bright and crisp and I was pleasantly surprised at the resolution quality.\n\nThe netbook comes with 1GB of RAM and I upgraded almost immediately as this was simply not enough and I was not happy with how slow programs and websites loaded. For $60 I bought a 2GB memory card and found it pretty easy to swap in. Note: There is only one card slot, so to upgrade, you will need to get a 2GB card and not an additional 1GB card.\nI bought an external ASUS DVD read/write drive for $72 which works well but ends up being a little bulky to carry around once it is in it's case. This is the opposite of what I was trying to do by adding a netbook to my laptop collection.\nI have not upgraded to full windows 7 yet but am likely to do that as the starter version of the operating system is very basic and limiting.\n\nBy the time you buy the memory card, CD/DVD drive and upgrade to windows you could easily have a richer function laptop (or an ipad and a couple of hundred dollars to spend on content) so I'm not sure I would recommend this to everyone.\n\nThe one significant problem that I have encountered is with the headset output. I was trying to use the netbookch a movie on a plane and could not hear anything. Even though I was using noise isolating headphones, the output from the netbook was really low and made it basically useless for media viewing in public (i.e. with a headset).\n\nOverallthis is not a bad netbook and is reasonable value for money but beware of the sound limitations and the extra costs for upgrades.",

                "review_body": "I just received this 1005PR yesterday morning, and after reading these reviews here, I checked in my 'Device Manager' list of this unit and confirmed that I DO have an installed Broadcom CrystalHD Video Decoder listed under 'Sound, Video, and Game Controllers' category, and my HD plays smoothly on the included Arcsoft Media Player, but does not play sound, I assume since my sound tracks are in Dobly Digital and this trial version wont let you have all features. The Windows Media Player that is included with Windows 7 Starter doesn't seem to be playing the h.264 video, as it does try to play, but the video is all garbled up and unwatchable. HD on websites using Flash plays fine. But DO upgrade Adobe Flash Player as another reviewer here stated.\n\n I originally had purchased a 1005HA a few months ago and wound up giving it to my wife (she doesn't care about HD) and got this 1005PR instead and I really like it so far. Except out of the box, I'm not really too happy with their entire software package / bundle. It does run really slow. You have to do all of the standard Win 7 tweaks on it to get the performance back up to par. I had put an SSD drive in the 1005HA I gave to my wife and am really happy with it, so I got another SSD drive to put in this 1005PR but just haven't put it in yet, as I want to make sure I am really happy with the entire unit before I void the warranty just yet and disassemble this thing. I put the 2GB stick of RAM in and it is performing pretty good right now, but I know with the SSD drive installed it will do a lot better. I tested several video files in full 1920 x 1080p and some video cam files in 1440 x 1080p and they play fine in that trial version of Arcsoft Media whatever-it's-called 3 thing, but the sound doesn't work (since it's the trial version doesn't play Dolby copyrighted audio), but I tried these same h.264 video clips using Windows Media Player which comes with this Win 7 starter, and like I said the video is all garbled and unwatchable. I am going to use one of my Windows Anytime Upgrade license keys and upgrade it to full Win 7 Pro which should have the fully functional Windows Media Player and I know it has a very nice h.264 Mpeg 4 decoder built-in so we'll see how that works. I am going to image this OS onto my SSD drive first and then upgrade that one to my Win 7 Pro version. For now I'm going to install my Power DVD 9 Ultra (although it's h.264 decoder is not as smooth as Windows Media Player that comes in Win 7 Pro) and I'll see how that goes.\n\n As far as the Arcsoft Media Center solution which is included in the software bundle goes, I'm not a big fan of bundled software that is not fully-functional and didn't ship with the laptop in it's fully-functional state. This for some reason irritates me whenever I buy a new computer and none of the included software just simply works forever. I usually get mad and don't even try it too much and uninstall all the trials because I already own programs that usually work better than the trials they've packaged into the software bundle. But ever since I used the latest Windows Media Player (12 I think it is), that shipped on my Win 7 Pro for my other Lenovo Thinkpad I fell in love with their new h.264 decoder because it plays HD smooth as silk, and all my Dish Network Satellite rips are usually broadcast with h.264 compression. It is even smoother than the Power DVD 9 Ultra one by a noticable amount. So my preference as far as a media player would be to try and get Windows Media Player to work. It only ships on the new Windows 7 OSs, and I think the Win 7 Starter might not have the full featured version because like I said, it looks all garbled on this new Netbook. I will post an update when I get my upgrade key installed and I'm running the full Win 7 Pro and post back about whether the h.264 Mpeg4 works at that time.\n\n But all in all, I am very happy with this new netbook since I don't feel like I'm working through a keyhole, because with the hi-resolution panel I have plenty of screen real estate. The other 1005HA I gave to my wife, even after adjusting the DPI and skrinking everything as small as I could in the software and registry settings, in the end it was still just a 1024x600 panel. This new hi-res panel in this 1005PR makes me feel a lot more at home since I come from a T61p Thinkpad with a 1680x1050 res panel and with all that real estate, I just couldn't get used to the limited resolution that came on netbooks, but this new netbook is the answer to the problem, the reason why I never had wanted to get a netbook before, was the pathetic resolutions they traditionally had. But with this one, I could use this all day, except the processor is still a bit slow for developers as compiling code it is way too slow with the atom processor. But if I have internet connection available, I can still connect to my server at home and do my dev work on the netbook, upload the code to the server, and then have it compile the code, so this is not a deal-breaker, just a small hassle. If they could get these compact netbooks to have real processors with Core2 Duo or Quad even, that would be the bomb. But for now, this little 1005PA is quite the little machine for what it is, and the battery life is amazing. I also bought a second battery for a spare and that's one thing the Thinkpad T61p could ever touch was it could only last maybe close to 2 hrs on battery but this 1005PR lasts more like 8-9 hours on a single battery, and I have 2 of them, so I just leave the charger at home. I do wish I could get a cradle charger though, to charge the batteries without having to put them into the netbook to charge. If somebody made a cradle charger for these and other netbook models, I think it would be a hit sale. Maybe I should send this idea to some Chinese manufacturing company, I'm sure they would jump on the chance.\n\nBut I would recommend this netbook to anyone who wants more screen real estate, and the ability to watch HD content since that is where all TV has moved and is still moving. If your netbook did not come with the Broadcom hardware or is not functioning according to the item description, then simply contact Amazon and make them send you the correct model as it was advertised, since it says right in the item description that it has this hardware. Let THEM fight with Asus since they are the big retailer with the strong arm. Amazon has been very reasonable to me as I've bought lots of stuff from them over the years, and they've never been unfair with me, and their return policies are very accomodating, almost as good as Costco's.\n\nI'm giving it 4 stars because the current software package ought to be optimized more for performance because the bloatware makes it run slow on the Atom processor and this may deteer the average consumer who does not know how to reduce the bloatware on their own accord. Once bloatware is removed, and performance settings are optimized, and 2GB RAM is installed, then this machine performs pretty good and works decent for having an Atom processor. Developers typically tend to forget that more code is not always better. The code needs to be sized and taylored for the hardware it is running on. On, my other netbook, I still run Windows Aero Desktop theme and it works fine, but I DO turn off much of the animation in the Visual Settings, like animate menus, and fade or slide menus, etc, etc. As soon as I do the upgrade on this netbook to Win 7 Pro, I will also turn on Aero just because I like the semi transparent taskbar look and color, but I will also disable most of all the animation effects as I did on my wife's netbook. And if you go to the startup tab in msconfig what is all that junk that they think needs to run at startup? This is what I'm talking about. You can still get the pretty looks without slowing the thing down to a noticable amount. It's like they think the Atom processor is not going to go any slower, yet they run all the same stuff as the laptops they sell with the Core2 Duo processors and stuff. But other than that, so far, it looks like a decent netbook.",

                "review_body": "I am a full time consultant and spent a lot of time in Dec 2010 looking for a laptop that would mostly be a desktop replacement, but that I would also travel with to client sites.  I have had this machine for over 20 months and it has done a great job.  I don't do a lot of heavy computing, but when I do, the core i5 is surprisingly adequate. I don't do heavy graphics, but it is supposed to be adequate for moderate gaming.  I bought this over the more expensive bamboo model because the latter did not upgrade to 8G ram, and the lights indicating things like whether you are plugged in, wireless is running etc were hidden from view. A small thing, but super annoying to have to lift up the computer to see these lights.\n\nPros:\n1. amazing value for money\n2. very capable for working IT consultant not doing super heavy computing\n3. upgradeable to 8G ram\n4. Small enough to use on a plane in economy seating\n5. can do moderate gaming\n6. backed by Asus 2 year guarantee and I can have it serviced at my local shop where I bought it - an Asus qualified shop.\n7. The mouse gestures are really handy, especially for scrolling\n8. Very reliable, have not had any problems to speak of\n9. Windows 7 and DisplayLink make it very easy to have multiple monitors. I currently use 4, including the laptop screen.\n\nCaveats:\n1. not very light, if you want to travel a lot\n2. battery life very poor; I get by with an extra battery, but even that only just lasts 4-6 hrs.\n3. mouse pad not super smooth or responsive\n4. no backlit keyboard\n\nI can probably use this machine for another year or two if need be, but I am shopping around a bit, hoping that Asus will come out with a comparable model with the Ivy Bridge Core i7 chip with flash drive to make things more snappy. Some Ultrabooks have come out recently in this category, but I don't need to pay the premium for super small and light.\n\nThis would be a great machine to pick up used, if you can live with the caveats and want Win 7 rather than Win 8.  I might be selling mine before too long ;-)",

I've replaced the power adapter once when it broken after 18 months, but never had any problem other than that, and the battery that still holds a strong 6-8 hour on regular balanced battery setting (not power saving).\nThe other drawback for this laptop is probably the monitor. The resolution is pretty crisp and clear, but my eyes get tired after looking at it for too long. When I use it at home, I always use an external display just to reduce the eye strain.\nOverall, this laptop is amazing in terms of its performance! Some external features may not be the best, but those can be easily solved with replacements/extensions!",

So when you are really crunched on time, its a great handy tool. It lets u surf web, chat, etc. The most useful functionality of laptop in my view\nKeyboard absolutely great for the size. (full size)\n\nCons:\nOnce my fan started creating loud noise and would not go off till I turned it off. Dont know what caused it but it just happened once. So am ok with it.\nWill be sluggish at time (of course its a dual core not a quad).\nThe webcam is uselessly low resolution.\nThe startup webcam login is equally annoying as it takes longer to login that way than just typing in the password.\n\nSo all in all, its a good laptop to carry around and use basic applications but if you need performance, look for something else (maybe Dell alienware; hear that they are great performance wise)",

Turbo33 toggle needs a restart to take effect. The first time I turned it on it wanted to burn recovery discs. This required 5 or 6 discs and the unit doesn't even have a burner. There was no option to save .iso images instead. Why not just put these discs in the box, Asus? Loaded with crapware out of the box. I spent a good hour or two removing it all. No Windows CD (I have an external drive I could use it with) so doing a clean install wasn't possible\n\n* Medium: In my unit the HD clicks frequently. I discovered this was due to the hard drive parking heads every few seconds. The HD is rated for 600K load cycle, and this would easily have been exceeded after 1yr of use if I hadn't found a tool called \"QuietHDD\"\"",

The battery life is great and using it for classes 8 hours a day without a charger is a huge plus.  I am also able to play some games, but can't have huge expectations for graphics (usually have to run it on the lowest settings).  Now for the complaints:  Build quality is just ok, there are screws on the bottom that come repeatedly loose, and these are the screws that hold the screen to the laptop base.  Keyboard has some flex and the keys themselves seem loose and noisy. My biggest gripe though is that after a year of windows my computed has inevitable become bogged down, and it is time for a reinstallation.  However, ASUS doesn't provide you the a copy of windows to reinstall.  You have to pay $50.00 for a recovery DVD (not to mention a ridiculous $9.00 for S&H).

                "review_body": "I've been in the market for a portable computer I could get work done on.  I'm a web developer, and I need a device that supports OpenCL, which somewhat limited my selection to computers with discrete graphics.  I thought about stepping up to a computer with a 2010 Core processor (Core i3, or i5), but the were always out of my price range when paired with a decent graphics card, or had sub standard battery performance.\n\nPros:\nSo I ended up with this computer.  So far after a week, I love it.  It works, the keyboard is comfortable, the touch pad required some getting used to but I adapted to it quickly.  The battery life has been incredible even on turbo with the graphics card on it will make it though most of a day of work without charging.  With the card off, and with turbo disabled it lasts for the bus ride into work, a full day of work, and the ride home, which is what I wanted and needed since I consider that time on the bus as potentially useful, and so far it has been.  If nothing else I get to go over scripts and read books while I ride, sometimes I put in actual work too.\n\nCons:\nThere is a screen flicker.  This is generally when the graphics card is switching.  You can control this by setting the Control Panel up correctly.  If you don't know what's going on, when you unplug it the screen will dim, and after a few minutes the screen will go black then come back on.  This is the computer switching off the Nvidia 210 to the Intel chipset's 4500HD which is far less powerful, but relatively power efficient, which happens after 15 minutes as configured out of the box in the OS.  It also tends to happen when waking up from sleep.\n\nMy only other real complaint has to do with the turbo mode which requires you to restart the computer.  On days where I know that I won't be in front of a plug for awhile I turn it off before I head out the door.  Otherwise I just leave it on.  I've managed to get 7 hours with turbo on, and the battery wasn't out of juice, so it's not much of a problem...\n\nOther than that it's the nicest laptop in the house by quite a large margin.  Most of our other devices are at least 5 years old, heavy, don't do what I need, and last maybe an hour off the plug, so this computer has been a breath of fresh air.\n\nThe speakers are surprisingly loud for the size, they positively beat up my wife's HP laptop, even if they don't have impressive bass.\n\nThe screen is glossy, but I can still read it even in direct sunlight if I crank up the brightness.  Color is pretty darn good, and the vertical viewing angles are good considering it has a TN panel and all.\n\nMy other real complaint is that the inside of the computer (the deck, and bezel around the screen) show dust like no one's business.  I'm almost wishing I'd shelled out the extra 20 bucks for the silver version of the laptop.  As it is, I've learned to keep a micro fiber cloth in my computer bag, but it does sometimes bug me.\n\nOtherwise this has been one of the best purchasing decisions I've made in a while.  The computer has the right mix of performance, portability, and battery life to meet all my needs.\n\nupdated: 4/10/2013:  This computer died in November.  The side vent fan became jammed, and the system overheated.  This wasn't user serviceable, and trying to pop the bottom of the case off became an exercise in extreme frustration that lead to breaking several of the plastic clips which held the bottom assembly to the top.  So serviceability and DIY repair ended up being the downfall of the system.  Without being able to clean out the gunk the system died.  Other than that the computer itself did reasonably, the hard drive died after 15 months, and was replaced by a SSD (which was a massive upgrade that took a lot of the sting out of loosing the HDD), the plastic around the keyboard broke after about a year and a half, although it was a minor annoyance.  Still overall given the relatively short lifetime the system I'd have to say it wasn't a great purchase, even if it did adequately meet my needs during the time it was with me.",

Asus doesnt provide any windows 7 reinstallation DVD although they have the Ai recovery installed which prompts you to backup the whole thing. I backed up and it was 4 DVD's and I am sure it again had all the bloatware. I had another OEM windows 7 home premium 64 bit DVD with which I erased the hard drive and reinstalled windows 7. I was worried that windows may not recognize the key provided on the sticker behind the laptop since the windows 7 installed didnt come with the laptop. But no problems in authentication.

Here's a few pros and cons of this netbook as well as a couple suggestions all in a quick summary.\n\nPro's: Good resolution, good clicky keyboard, Good for the basic needs, battery life lasts for a good amount of time, has 3 usb ports, was able to play Portal and other older games on low settings,and very portable.\n\nCon's: I did not care for the rough texture on touch pad, battery gets old after the first year as well as the keys, screen is very hard to clean unless you use a cleaning solution, gets a little slow at times and heats up fast, battery feels loose though it is locked in, Windows 7 Starter \"really\"\" blows",

                "review_body": "My favorite thing about this computer is it's size. Something I didn't think about before I bought it was that it would be really easy to curl op on the couch and cradle the computer between my legs or on my stomach or something. It's just really easy to maneuver physically. And I love how lightweight it is. The only other laptop I had before I got this little guy was an ibook g4 that I received as a graduation present. It was great and gorgeous and very cool and all that, but it didn't really function as a portable computer because in those days laptops were HEAVY, man. Plus no wireless internet. This is like the opposite of that. it's so light I can carry it and my notebook and stuff around in a shoulder bag all day and not really care. It's pretty darn fast on the internet, if you have a good connection. Sometimes, however, it takes forever to get on the login page of a public network, but I think that might just be the network. It's great that it comes with free online storage, although I don't really have enough stuff on here to warrant using it yet. At first the screen and font does seem awfully small, but I really got used to it and the touch pad has little zoom shortcuts so it's easy to do that if you can't see something. This is coming from a college student who has to read a ton of online articles, by the way. When I use my boyfriends laptop now which has like a 17 inch screen or something it feels disquietingly huge. The battery life is awesome, too, although I don't think it's always 11 hours like it says. Maybe if you have it on sleep a lot. But it's still really long, just as good as a lot of smart phones. So anyway, I love this little guy, and I use it way more than I thought I would. I'm actually kind of becoming a computer person now.",

Many people have complained about Windows 7 starter, but I expected it to be a simple operating system to run basic needs such as web-surfing, instant messaging, Skype, youtube, etc.  It does the job well! I am very satisfied with the performance and highly recommend those with a little less patience to go ahead and upgrade to the 2gb RAM.

It's royal blue!\n\nCONS:\n- battery life states 11 hours, I only get about 6hrs and have already dimmed the screen.\n- 1gb RAM is too slow for me, upgrade to 2gb for an extra $30 bucks.  You can run more programs w/o the lag.\n- finger-print magnet! Better have some clean hands when handling this netbook!\n\nBasically, for the price ($314.99), this netbook is definitely worth the money.  I'm glad I made this investment.",

Thought it quit a little before it's time though.. I can't say i'm real impressed with Windows 7 Starter.. It seems real choppy and unsmooth.. Maybe if I bump up the ram it might help.. The e-mail program is something to be desired.. I guess i'm an old diehard Outlook Express user for e-mail and sending photos.. I do have one desktop that is running Windows 7 home and that seems a little better.. For a netbook, I think XP was a better choice. With this one, Start up time is horrible.  Also took a few hours to remove all the free preloaded garbage they install.. In my opinion, i'm not seeing a real advantage to owning this over a regular laptop.  Maybe if you travel quite a bit it would be nice because it's light weight.. The screen is pretty small but it's a netbook..  I do have to give Amazon a big thumbs up, as it arrived way before expected.  Bottom line: maybe ok for everyday e-mailing and surfing, but you can get a laptop for just a little more money and I think most would be happier with a bigger screen, bigger keyboard, and also a faster, smoother operating system.. I would stay with XP, but we have to keep up with the changing times. Soon it will not be supported and Windows 7 will be the main choice.  Unless you're netbook has XP, I would probably keep looking for something other than Windows 7 Starter on a netbook..",

                "review_body": "I just purchased this netbook after my previous Asus (the dependable S101) died b/c the screen was damaged by my own carelessness.  So with that in mind, here's my quick take on the 1005PE MU27 model, which I received yesterday.\n\nPros:\n- Nice feel of the keyboard.  Firm and the spacing between the keys did not affect my typing in any way.\n- Attractive cover (I bought the blue colored unit) and look to the machine.\n- Fairly painless installation.  The first boot took about 10 min or so, and updating the latest files for Windows 7 starter took about 30 min, not too bad.\n- Based on the 1GB ram usage, surfing the web was a breeze.  Watching videos on youtube or playing flash-based games all was fine.  But at times I did notice some hiccups when many programs were running so I opted to upgrade to 2GB (see below edit for info).\n- Battery life was very very decent.  On a full charge on the high performance mode I managed about 7-8 hours.\n- Quick charge time for battery.\n- Very nice touchpad.  Very responsive.\n- Great price point for people looking to do very basic stuff on the computer.\n\nMehs:\n- Screen resolution was ok.  Not really up to part with the higher end counterparts.\n- Camera is standard 0.3Mb quality\n- Unit is not as 'sleek' compared to my old S-101, which was definitely lighter, more slender, and didn't feel as 'bulky' of sorts vs the 1005PE\n- Click button below touch pad a bit clunky.\n\nCons:\n- Windows 7 starter blows.  It's fine if you're just going to use this netbook to do basic stuff like surf the web, send emails, or play games on facebook.  But not recommended if you're looking to do more extensive things with the netbook.\n- Did I tell you Windows 7 blows?  Serious lack of customization.  It's lame that you can't even change your desktop wallpaper without downloading some other app to circumvent the problem.  Dumb you can't personalize fonts etc.\n- Does not include even a basic cloth cover for the netbook.  Even in my previous S101 unit they included at least a cheap little cover for the netbook.\n- Finger print magnet.  Better have clean hands when holding this laptop!\n- Feels kind of heavy.  It looks small, but weighs more than you think.  Definitely outweighs my old S101 by a fair margin.  (And boots a bit slower than my old S101, though my old OS was XP, which I still think was great to use).\n\nSummary\n- Great computer for price conscious folks\n- Great computer for people not looking to do much more than just surf the web, send emails, do basic stuff like type papers etc.\n- Is just fine if you can live with the (many) bare-bones limitations of Windows 7 starter.\n- Won't blow you away, but is a decent all around machine at a reasonable price point\n\n**EDIT 6/25/10**\n\nI would also like to point out that I decided to upgrade the RAM on this netbook.  It was partially because I wasn't too thrilled with the performance of Windows 7 (I still ABSOLUTELY HATE the lack of customization options on the starter OS.  COME ON MICROSOFT!!!).  But also I noticed sometimes things got a bit sluggish when I ran multiple programs.\n\nAnyway I just want to point out I bought the 2GB RAM from Kingston = Kingston ValueRAM 2 GB 800MHz PC2-6400 DDR2 CL5 SODIMM Notebook Memory (KVR800D2S5/2G) (Link Below):\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00102A066/ref=cm_cr_mts_prod_img\n\nI would strongly recommend anybody who wants a bit more out of this netbook to consider upgrading the memory.  I noticed a nice difference in performance after my upgrade.  VERY VERY HAPPY that I did so.\n\nFor those of you who aren't aware - the Asus memory comes with 1GB RAM that's upgradable to 2GB.  There's only 1 memory slot so you will have to take out the old chip.\n\nTo do so - (REMEMBER UNPLUG COMPUTER AND REMOVE BATTERY BEFORE STARTING THIS PROCESS)\n1. Remove the single screw from the memory casing on the bottom of th netbook.\n2. Remove the old chip (carefully since it comes out at an angle)\n3. Insert new chip carefully (again at an angle somewhat) and make sure it snaps into place.\n4. Put battery back on, turn on computer, press F2 upon powering up to get into bios and make sure computer recognizes memory.\n5. All done.\n\n- Note the kingston memory chip had none of the issues that other users previously noted with other brands.  At least I didn't experience any hiccups.  2GB does make a difference.",

It's ok for surfing the web in a limited manner (if I have more than about 3-4 windows open at a time it starts to get pretty sluggish).  It will probably do what you want it to but it gets around to it in its own sweet time.  Sometimes it completely freezes up and CPU usage leaps to 100% for no apparent reason.  However, it usually WILL figure out what ever its problem is and start working again after a minute or two.\n\nBasically, this computer acts about like the 3 or 4 year-old computer you are probably replacing.  Based on other reviews I just went ahead and ordered the 2GB RAM chip.  I can't even IMAGINE trying to use this computer without it!  If it's as slow this slow with 2GB of RAM I don't even know how Asus can get them off the shelves with only 1 GB of RAM.\n\nDespite the fact that others seem to have no problems streaming video, I have never been able to stream video in anything that I would consider a satisfactory manner.  If you are ok with watching stuff in 30 second to 1 minute bursts (and then waiting for 30 seconds or so while it buffers) then you will probably be completely satisfied with it.  Me, I find that annoying.  Also, sometimes if you pause the video (to allow it to buffer) it won't UN-pause and you have to completely reload the page, negating any forward progress you may have made.\n\nA big selling point for me was the web storage but this proved to be VERY time consuming- I left my computer alone for a full day (plugged in so it was at peak performance) and I only have about 20GB out of ~120GB backed up.  I know that my connection speed had nothing to do with this as I could stream and transfer data with my other computer at a reasonable rate (sorry, I don't know specifics but it was fast enough that it seemed acceptable to me).  Also, the web storage only lasts for a year, after which point you have to pay (can't remember how much, only that it was more than I was willing to pay!) so I decided it made more sense to just buy an external hard drive.\n\nA few technical things that I find particularly frustrating:\n\nThe touch pad is super sensitive, which actually ends up being a huge pain in the ass because just having your thumb hover over the touch pad constantly causes the computer to jump to wherever your curser happens to be on the page.  Not exactly a huge deal but if you aren't paying attention you type whole sentances in the middle of your paragraph so it can be annoying.\n\nThe shift bar is really small and that is a GIANT inconvenience because you instead hit the page up button at the same time, which selects all the text between where you are typing and the top of the page, resulting in you deleting the entire page of typing.  I can't even begin to imagine how much time I have wasted because of this.  This could have been remedied by Asus getting rid of the right Fn key (does anyone even use this?!) and shifting the page up key over 1/2 inch, since there is another Fn key on the left of the keyboard.\n\nThe two-finger scrolling takes a lot of time to get used to and it only works about 80 or 90% of the time.  Also, it's really easy to accidentally resize the page.  I am sure this is a feature that could be kindof cool if you got the hang of it but I haven't gotten to that point so I find it pretty obnoxious.\n\nThe final kicker though, and what motivated me to write up this review, is that my battery life has gradually decreased to the point that it lasts only about 4-5 hours.  When I first got the computer I could get around 10-10.5 hours on the \"balanced\"\" plan- not exactly as high as it was advertized at but I knew that to get such a long life out of the battery you had to do a bunch of configuring with the power settings and I had access to power most of the time so I was pretty satisfied.  I intend to use this computer on a year long trip in Latin America",

System feels solid and has excellent build quality. The webcam works fine, and it's fast enough for my daily business and software development tasks. My only gripes thus far? The system comes with a good bit of junkware. It's partitioned with an 80gb system partition, and the rest for data. I wanted to start fresh so I had to find a Windows 7 x64 Pro install disk, repartition, and install the drivers/tools I needed. (The product activated fine with the product key sticker on the bottom of the system.)  It has HDMI, but no eSATA port.  Lastly, it's common to have the cursor jump while typing due to brushing the touchpad, but I fixed this problem after installing the touchpad driver and tweaking the settings.  Overall, I'd recommend this product to anyone needing a full featured lightweight laptop.",

There were two major things I was looking for:\n\nDiscrete video card\nunder $900\n\nI agonized over various Toshiba (since my previous laptops had all been Toshibas) and Acer models, and came upon this one, from Asus. So here's my review:\n\nPros: It's a pretty powerful little machine. Graphics card and CPU are both fairly powerful. I've been running Eve Online with graphics at full settings, and it runs like a dream. Comes with a DVD multidrive, also a plus. Plenty of USB ports (including a USB 3.0, which I don't think there's any actual use for... yet), and the keyboard \"feels\"\" right. To be honest",

I use it primarily for watching movies on Netflix while playing poker. Of course I have it connected to bigger monitor for the movies. This laptop is quite inexpensive.\n\nASUS is famous for manufacturing quality motherboards hence it would make more sense to buy a laptop from them.",

                "review_body": "Purpose of the Computer\nGeneral purpose activities such as browsing, word processing, reading emails, college work, occasional game, or occasional software development.\n\nSome Defects:\nI have owned this laptop for a year and a quarter. (Laptop was manufactured in August of 2010) Overall the laptop has performed well, but there are some problems and some design defects. First, the keyboard is not the best of quality as after several months of use the v key broke which I had to fix using superglue. Also, the keyboard flexes constantly, but the flexing is not too much of a problem. The next problem is the screen. The screen is not reinforced enough against pressure, and the spacers are less then adequate, as the screen will touch the keyboard. Because of this design defect with the screen, my screen as sustained damage and now has two pressure marks left on the LCD in the center of the screen. Lastly, the hot key software provided by Asus is not the greatest and has locked up on me several times forcing me to manually restart the process. However, I have found the software to be stable if the hibernation or standby features of Windows 7 are not used.\n\nSome issues:\nThe screen will flicker when connected to the ac after using the battery. This issue can be fixed by unplugging the laptop and then plugging the laptop back in. Additionally, there is no easy access to the fan duct making it impossible to clean dust out of the computer without voiding the warranty.\n\nThe Verdict\nI am overall pleased with the laptop, but am only giving the product three stars as my former laptop, a Dell Inspiron E1405, had none of these problems. Additionally, the Inspiron had covers which allowed access to the fan duct for cleaning, a feature I consider important.",

                "review_body": "I've been using the laptop for nearly a month and have been very impressed with the balance of performance, battery life, size, and weight.  It runs all my applications without trouble.  I use it primarily as a website development machine.  I can have my entire XAMPP development environment loaded, including Eclipse, MySQL, Apache, and Photoshop without it slowing down at all.\n\nThe keyboard and trackpad are easy to use and the screen is great.  I don't have any trouble seeing the screen in bright light.  I can go for hours on the battery; I have yet to run out of power despite a couple weeks of constant traveling and usage, including time in the airport and up to 4 hours on the airplane.\n\nThe only two problems I've had are with the internal fan and the speakers.  When I updated my system drivers the fan was very noisy and wouldn't slow down at all - even though the laptop wasn't at all hot.  I had to go back to an earlier driver to fix it.  The speakers are also very quiet - which isn't that big of a deal to me as I generally use headphones anyway.\n\nOverall a great product.",

                "review_body": "At first, I was confused when I looked at product description. There is no different between G73JH-A1 and G73JH-A3. I made a decision to purchase G73JH-A3 anyway. I bought it via one business delivery, and it was delivered last night. I found that the spec of G73JH-A3 is different from G73JH-A1. G73JH-A3 has\n\n1 8G 1333 MHz Memory, not 1033 MHz.\n2. Yes, A3 has 4G SSD. You can select  statup applications by FastBoot utility  and it boosts up the Windows 7 startup speed a lot.\n\nI am a programmer more than 30 years and I used more than 40 notebooks. Recently, I ordered Dell Studio 17 but Dell could not deliver it on time and  I cancelled the order and purchased this G73JH-A3. The ASUS quality is much better than Dell, I guess. My other notebook, Dell Studio XPS 1640 has many troubles for me and I fixed it several times.\n\nThis notebook is perfect to me, because I develop applications by Java, and I need memory and hard disk space. I am using Windows 7 and Ubuntu 10.04. G73JH-A3 works well at both OS.\n\nWhen I setup G73JH-A3 today, it was crashed several times. Specially, when I played MS media player, it was always crashed. I set TDT at bios disabled and it is now O.K or upgrade bios to version 209.\n\nI am very satisfied with this notebook. G73JH is not only a gaming machine. It supports my development a lot. Also, it looks like a normal notebook(At least, front look). I could use it at my office.\n\nGood:\n  1. Nice quality, good keyboards, sound and display\n  2. Many Asus utilities to customerize configuration.\n  3. Good price\n\nBad:\n  1. Where is express card slot? G73JH does not have it. I could not use my sound blaster express card.\n  2. Touchpad is useless. The buttons are too firm to press.\n  3. Old fashioned battery (8cell) - 12 cell recommended. It could make half hour longer life without external power.\n  4. I hope that G73JH will have audio control buttons on the top. Sometimes, I will use this notebook at office, and audio buttons are recommended.\n  5. Lack description at manuals: Yes, I know what they are without explanation. I am a programmer. But, the manuals does not explain manythings(VT-d, TDT, UEFI boot or PXE ROM). Normal people don't know them and they could not find any information from ASUS web site.\n  6. Asus update tool looks not working.",

That is said, I did have to return it twice, first time the DVD/Blu Ray drive was not working properly, PowerDVD used to freeze and I have to force shut it down, but Amazon sent a replacement within 6 hours and within two days I got the new machine. 2 days later I realized that I have one did pixel on the screen, for that I had to get an RMA and return it to ASUS to replace the screen. For about 4 months everything was perfectly working fine. I use this computer for gaming in addition to real work. I played COD modern warfare 2, GTA 4 and Assassin Greek and Resident Evil 5. You can get the same specs from Dell/Alienware for about $2700, while I bought my ASUS from Amazon for $1842. And I love the screen, it is an amazing HD and great quality picture.\n\nAfter six months of owning the laptop a new problem has appeared. The video card (GPU) overheats when playing games for more than 30 minutes. After 30 minutes the laptop shuts down due to high temperature. I did some research and I realized that the laptop GPU idle temperature should be around 55C, while mine was in the range 75-80C. While gaming the temperature should be around 75-85C, while mine exceeds 100C all the time and it reaches the maximum allowed temperature 114C then the computer shuts down. I have to wait 5 minutes for the computer to cool down then turn it on again. The fans on the laptop are always on high speed, specially the one next the video card.\n\nI have to RMA it again. One expects that such product to be thoroughly tested since it is a gaming laptop. Now, I have listed my laptop for sale, because to me this unacceptable failure.",

                "review_body": "I've had this netbook about 4 months, and have been very happy with it.  The only problem was the activation of the AT&T 3G.  Unlike the reviewer above, ASUS customer service was no help AT ALL. He just kept chanting \"we do not support 3G\"\".  He said maybe I didn't have the right SIM card in my computer.  He said I should contact Amazon.  He said no one there could help me.  He said they do not support 3 G.  He said I could try calling CS back and by chance perhaps I would get someone more competent",

As a full time student who spends a lot of time typing, the keyboard was one of the most important features to me when comparing laptops.  The keyboard on this Asus is very comfortable, comparable to the keyboard on the Mac Powerbooks.  And I love having the number pad!  I guess it all depends on what you're used to. I'd also like to comment that the laptop looks great.  From the photos it looked pretty plain, and I was worried about being dissapointed by it because I was looking for something stylish.  In the end I chose Asus' reputation as being reliable over the style of some other laptops I was considering.  When I recieved my Asus I realized that it was the best of both worlds--all the reliability and components I wanted, and really sharp looking too!  I'd recommend the Asus K50IJ to anyone based on my experiences so far.",

                "review_body": "Bought my Asus K50IJ in January 2010, so I've been with it for a while. Mine has the older T6600 (Core 2 Duo) processor, but according to some research it is almost identical to the T4500 in this model. I use my computer several hours per day, mostly on the Internet, and I have been very pleased overall. Here are some of the things I've observed:\n\nPositive: excellent style and all around feel. Processor, hard drive and RAM are more than adequate for any good laptop - in fact, a 500 GB hard drive is extremely rare for this price. The computer is much cooler than other models, as Asus says. Battery life is good to excellent. Keyboard is OK overall; more about that later. The one year damage replacement warranty was a strong selling point with me. Haven't had any experience at all with Asus support; though I'm told its excellent. Facial recognition login works quite well most of the time, depending on light, and is a much easier way to log in. SD card reader is conveniently placed (front center) and simple to use to DL photos from my camera or cell.\n\nNegative: first, using the keyboard with the touch pad is insanely aggravating. It is impossible to type rapidly without my palms bumping the touch pad now & then, and when that happens the cursor is repositioned and I begin typing somewhere else. (Yes, I have tried every imaginable setting for the touch pad.) This happened constantly and was VERY aggravating, so of course I began to use a wireless mouse 99% of the time - thankfully I can set it to ignore touch pad input when it is plugged in. But every now & then I like to use the computer without the external mouse. According to the settings I chose, it should automatically begin responding to input from the touch pad when I unplug the mouse - but no such luck. The last few times I've unplugged the mouse, it refused to respond to touch pad input, so I had no control at all until I plugged in the mouse again. Also, several times I have plugged in the mouse after using the touch pad, and the touch pad refused to stop responding. In each of these cases I had to do several reboots to clear up the problem. Consequently I no longer attempt to use the computer without the external mouse - too much hassle. I feel this is a major issue, and prevents me from awarding this computer the five stars it would otherwise earn.\n\nAnother issue that is the computer must be handled very gently. I bumped it a couple of times when it was new, and heard a weird mechanical clicking inside, and the screen froze. I had to do a hard reboot. Obviously I handle it like an egg now, but it seems a laptop should be able to handle a few minor bumps without any issues. That is certainly true with the last one, which is now 6 or 7 years old.\n\nAs to layout design - the keyboard is not all that user friendly, as the advertisement implies. Response is less than stellar - often while typing rapidly I will hit a key and not get any response - so I have to back up and re-type. If you do a lot of typing, this could be an issue for you. In addition, the arrow keys are oddly placed - wedged between the number keys and alpha keys. This computer replaced an older IBM x-31, which, although admittedly IBM's top of the line premium business model, had a wonderfully responsive keyboard compared to this one. I could easily \"blind type\"\" on the IBM with few errors. The lack of dedicated volume keys is a problem as well. In fact",

I reviewed a lot of laptops and learned that Asus is the number 1 brand for reliability which is important to me.  It runs very well - I like Windows 7 and it has enough RAM.  My 2 dislikes are both with the keyboard.  First it offers the number keypad portion like a full sized keyboard.  This is great, BUT it ends up making the keys smaller than normally and I can't type worth a darn with the smaller keyboard keys.  It's really frustrating.  Second is the keyboard has a really flimsy feel - when you hit a key the entire area of keyboard around of the key mushes down.  Just makes it feel really flimsy.  Otherwise I do recommend this laptop.",

Received it on schedule and on time.\n\nso after unpacking and initializing the laptop;\n\nPros: Fast and responsive, have yet to receive any problems so far.\n\nCons: Nothing major/serious.\n\nSome minor cons: Glossy screen and frame can collect fingerprints and dust (but that can easily be cleaned from using Windex or an alternate friendly cleaning product). Minor bloatware to deal with (which can be easily uninstalled with out struggle using Ccleaner or a similar program)\n\nOther thoughts: i would personally recommend this laptop to other people that may be going to college, or needing a new or a replacement. Though i do somewhat disagree with the first review on how the keyboard may seem to feel flimsy, and i'm not exactly sure how the user not being able to type well because the key resizing from the built-in numpad affects the product, which both is a personal feeling or judgement.",

I have a couple of Lenovo's (510/520) but they do not have near the battery life and are huge in comparison. I added a small (64GB)SSD and still have room for 12-15 movies. The battery life seems better with the SSD, but I do not have any hard data on how much it is extended over the spinner. I also use a 64GB flash drive (USB 3.0) for all my work files (sync to other machines) and am able to use all MS Office apps and even able to view some Autocad files.\n\nIMHO this machine blows away my smartphone (Droid 2 Global). It has Win 7 pro (remote desktop), solid wi-fi and wired connections, USB 3.0, good camera and speakers for Skype, and will easily last 9 hours with moderate use. Meets my needs.\n\nStill, I wish it was dual core with HD display and video driver and onboard G3-G4. But, I want all this without loss of battery life. Am I asking too much?",

It came pre-loaded with Windows 7 and because the 1016P-BU17-BK is new from Asus, it came loaded with lots of goodies, like 3.0 usb, a faster and more reliable processor, standard with 2 mg ram and Win 7. I also own a Asus PC 1000 I've used for three years and this new netbook has a much better look and the keyboard is much more solid than what I have on my 1000. The 1016 seems thinner and lighter and although it is lacking the SSD like my 1000, it boots up just as fast and shuts down fast also. The wireless seems to work much better than my 1000 also, because it does not lose its connection like my 1000 does.\n\nI rate this little netbook 5-Stars.",

I manage a Cafeteria & wanted something that would be smaller & lighter in weight to use than my currant laptop. This one is perfect for me. It has enough ram & storage for all my work. Of course the screen is smaller than your normal laptop, but I love the fact the battery last so much longer then my currant (Toshiba) laptop. Never have a problem with finishing what I need to do on it before I need to recharge the battery. This is what mattered the most to me. Info stated 13 hrs. of battery; I typically get 10-12 hrs. with no problems. My Asus EE comes with 2GB Ram, 320 Hard drive, plus Windows 7 Professional. Don't fool with buying a netbook & upgrading the ram and adding Windows 7. This guy comes with everything ready to go on it. The outside case is great too, you don't have to worry about fingerprints. Everything about this netbook is great, I can highly recommend it!",

When gaming with my son, playing AOE 3 his computer loads faster and seems to have the same graphics if not better.  I would have thought that Asus would have been much better with a dedicated video card with one gig of dedicated ram.  Also the sound is so quiet I have to plug in speakers to hear people when I am talking on Skype or listening to music.  Just thought since I paid about two hundred more dollars for this computer it should be better.  The I5 core does seem to run cooler, but not noticeably different in speed.  I wonder if I have a defective machine?",

With turbo mode off and setting the LCD brighness down and changing a few other settings will probably keep you going longer, but for what I need it for I leave turbo on constantly and am very happy with 6 hours or more.\n\n- Seems to be very durable, it has brushed aluminum for a top cover and around the keyboard/touchpad area.  Makes it look very nice/sleak.  Also with being less that 1\" thick",

I'm displeased with this laptop. Tried my own fixes and was able to rid the MACHINE_CHECK_EXCEPTION BSOD, received maybe 10 BSOD's since having the laptop, purchased it approx 1 month ago.",

Was able to play Mafia2 and Batmen Arkam Asylum on High. Starcraft2 on medium, and newer titles on medium low. Also Optimus has proven to be very useful.\nKeyboard: Soft with good feedback. Very nice to print on.\nTouchpad: Far from being as good as the Apple, but does the job good enough, and has 2 fingers scrolling.\nScreen: Average quality with low angles, but expected for this computers price.\nBuild quality: Just great. Solid and strong.\nBattery: Can above 5 hours with a new battery and some tweaks, not bad at all in my opinion.\n\nStill using it today and even thinking upgrading to SSD. Gives me great value for its worth. Definitely money well spent.",
